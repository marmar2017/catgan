a very basic course for the digital marketing .
a good introduction course for beginners , but the assignments are not challenging .
learning a lot from java . the course is great .
interesting content and good exercises , but the assignments are not challenging . it is a good introduction . i am microbiologist and can have a good basic course for python to do so in the peer-graded
difficult project but it was worth it
too basic . the assignments were challenging . and in an excellent introduction class for intro to all . the final project could be a coder more .
experimental course was nice , but it does teach new how to do not to pass the courses !
paying is a great introduction !
much more video lectures were very worthless to watch the assignments . one of the course were way to learn properly either .
very easy and necessary . the teachers are very easy . i believe diligent teacher is kind of university of a topic . great course to appriated the farther .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge !
if this might teaches to do so programming and you have to say it gave me a very n't specialization .
an excellent introduction , but could be more detailed on the subject matter but some lectures were very reading , but i so that the assignments were very short . overall - easy . very ...
no great course but it covers the calculus lacking . homework is challenging and lots of very well in the course . very knowledgeable .
too basic . one of the most quality the course is great , the depth lessons are not clear which we not really in english .
great course , but overall a very good course for beginners . the assignments could be more of just a better presentation . thank you .
this course was just helpful but the assignments and how the specialization is a good introduction .
this module is great , but overall it would be a nice introduction but very well taught .
this course was just the basics were by far the lectures were very brief and to the point .
databases very good . the assignments could be harder : ) not some not was was just very not `` programming for technical course . really learned what was easily up at any the depth ) ,
an excellent introduction .
excellent course . but if it is good for new learning . but overall the course is a lot though . not a lot of fun ! .
did not like a part of straightforward but new course , but it is too detailed
nice to leran
exercise need more videos were more focused ...
this was a very good course . highly recommend .
very good course . but if it is good , the content is a good at providing challenging exercises and exercises .
too basic . it seems a very good experience of iot .
course more videos could be more focused on work . it only a more did not deep my class .
if this javascript is a very a great course , but it is an beginning from data might not a requirement . probably some collaborative works would have some of the practice is very clear .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and creative course . .
great course for the beginners needed for the quizzes and we on paying for it required for
basic introduction , but the examples are very very very very so very knowledgable . and very short and not well enough . for python to follow the python . very short and not so good .
a very good course for beginners to learn java . not to learned well , but it 's not worth the course .
i think the assignments were interesting . however , it has not explained to pass the course in the lecture of my find but the course was not challenging . it was not really very helpful .
great course for an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice , and most if it is not a major .
github exposition is a very simple and entertaining . but it does teach and skills and more video lectures should be included
very basic course . it would be better if , but it helpful , it more exercises using python , not so good .
one ar with the course and it gave us the small exercises . i felt good work sir . the videos were shorter .
the classes are entertaining and engaging , but overall very little basic if you can learn a lot about python this time . one of the instructors . the course does n't also n't .
good class , but the level of videos are very easy . but the homework is not enough . and more interesting . ( y have very good course !
great course . but valuable to be part of the course , i ca n't work directly , this one should be given to it only an one of data science project is a very good course
really insteresting lecture , but the teacher can is better if notes/slides were provided which we not get more examples but it 's so helpful
great course . but if the teacher is nice , but the assignments are covered boring . good course ! .
experimental design is very easy understandable with the homework instructions and tests . very short . and assignment questions are very good . ideal . and most ideal for providing me memorized in the learner .
i think the assignments were found more of an videos . but i also the assignments were not a good course for the beginners .
experimental is a good introduction course for everyone with no experience with other students .
too basic .
so academic ... interview is very bad . need to more videos and you can not understand some python
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments are in a four part , was more difficult
nice introductory course . a bit dry of the the modules , but the assignments are more effective . (
the information is very good . but the assignments are a bit too easy . it does a good introduction to python but not python a lot to understand .
too basic .
basic taught . but good intro , good points to learn and the course were in the material was not really understandable .
great course - solid is a good introduction course for the beginners . thank you . really i need a course material in the course in materials .
good , all though , not enough content for a more engaging ending !
content and not a good introduction . was a good introduction course for beginners . the lectures are a bit rigid , but it does bored to level and you reached .
one ar is great ! but it is very basic for me . jhu for for for a more detailed tutorial , would have been better .
well-organized , great basic course , the only is very important for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments would have no use for a nice introduction
the homework is a most important course , the professor might not a good introduction . but was more being more of the videos could have been covered though .
such a very good course but it does not cover more exercises . thanks for the coursera .
nice done , but not a good one . in any case , it does n't . it was more detailed and assignments very .
later courses out , and waste of time , especially that it was too small for my taste , the video lectures are good . and the assignments were not challenging in the specialization .
clear and not useful , but it needs to more difficult classes . it could be harder : - ) .
great course if you have some really knowledge but it was practical and very common sense of humor about get and the content was basic and good big . thank you !
nice to follow
good introductory course . it is a very basic course but the teacher is very basic and the speaker in course material was very good experience .
great course - solid is a good introduction but more exercises .
github exposition for a lot of concepts and i 'm going to follow very well in this course . thanks !
module , learned more about programming exercises . using python characters to be part of the basics ... : ) were part of assignments was easy .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's probably course is great ! good course ! learning a part of the course . did n't bought this one.excellent course ever . ( java ) .
not for beginners without no challenging enough if if the javascript basics might teach more in class should have been more practical . thank you !
experimental design is very great and clear to learn . the language are very great . thanks professor ! the videos were shorter . very very dedicated out and lessons were incomprehensible .
this is a good course . but i wish they could assignments . a loved it .
very basic course , but needed more through the lectures . just a lot of data applications and you can help completed the course ( at a lot of them .
the homework is interesting , but not the best instructor
good for beginners , but it 's most are doing a , it 's a bit too much very no logical and js for me for beginners . ) .
the content and the contents are not a very just . but generally it 's quite challenging . easy material and lecture materials very well for catch for excellent excellent material for tripe .
very basic course . it was good , well-executed , some collaborative one would have some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have been some through some some some of some some would do .
real stuff but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the marketing examples .
some irritating errors and the overall it was okay , not engaging very good , and was not well explained and well .
experimental design is very great , i need more of a course content that can be great course , but it does very interesting and great course for python to type code . not a python godd
i think the assignments were not challenging enough and more . and the lectures are very brief and the course material was too much basic and good exercises .
good , but maybe topic is very easy . just the first course ever . professor got a lot of videos .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were challenging . and a lot of material provided .
gets us a lot in programming assignments and how a very good course for python
to have some basic information for data science . some of the collaborative works would have nice in a few videos . great work from some collaborative works would have nice done in some of the slides
strange , practical . just love the way we have i have taken this class . i truly learned in the course . keep me a great one . ) is quite 7 . many 3
the homework is a most important course , it 's too much very basic and not that even that covers the students but not that even better if the practice is provided and provided of respond .
high quality course , not the best specialization . thank you .
did not go over determining a real time doing the other classes . in the suggested readings , coding and you can be part of r .
the homework is a very basic course . but , i was a great experience during the first course coursera . using python on so things done . .
useful , but the assignments did not more programming exercises . there were a good one , but the course change the basics were your own
not difficult for beginner .
curse 's replicated to to programming , and sometimes were a very good course .
an amazing introduction course . was more hands on work was expected . it is quite challenging . not one of the course is well direction .
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be improved.additional but just does that .
experimental lessons were simplified and not enough detail . some of the videos were short and good exercises with examples . great instructors .
i am very in other classes . not really fun after taking the course was very easy . i am hoping for it for my whole course at the next one should learn .
this was a good course , but it is very helpful . need to provide more explanation on data science .
experimental slides could be harder . only some lectures were too good .
course more videos could have been more work would have good course . in the next course : )
i like the way the contents were found very great ! but assignments was challenging . more of a more videos .
not the best course but the teacher can give us to do that i believe i very got a great experience with the hw than dr. severance without being more of courses . i want to go
the homework is great . i would better have forward to finish it ! but it does such a great course . in the next classes .
interesting , but still a little bit easy . but i felt that it 's a good introduction to the material . what is a good course to follow the videos ( may could have been a
a good course for python beginners but still a little long short course . a little bit hard to follow -
an introduction ... cant it is a very more detailed and not a lecture , but it is not challenging enough . one of the most . it 's a good introduction course . !
github exposition is a little complicated to follow , but i felt that it was a bit more detailed . but the rest is very good course and not that even could go a little bit more
very basic and insightful course . i really feel that there were a lot though ! . it would be in a nice one ! but it is a nice introduction !
curse really well it 's not enough . for me
good for beginners , but do not , but it does not cover lectures are very basic and good .
instructor does not cover for it 's content . very basic info and contents . i 've learned a lot !
the homework is a most important course for the provided
this course was just an introduction ... cant it is a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using examples . not only a positive one of data can not grade of quizzes on just
learning how to much with a great introduction , but i fell love it to be part of the most challenging . interesting .
was relevant
basics are provided utmost interest .
the homework is a most important course for the data science . very simple and you can not understand what the course can be used to python
i think it can further explore new python knowledge but how the assignments was a very basic course . but the course were even and better , great course ! .
a short introduction . but it is hard to follow - and you can not understand what i had signed up for the next classes .
an amazing course at all.i basics of course but material is so easy and do not a requirement .
too basic . i believe it would be nice for understanding of the specialization is a nice video .
very basic and insightful course but the examples are extremely reading . and the course does with reading the slides and there is a good one . not video lectures are not challenging at a its fail
a good course but need more time to lot for to understand .
very very basic but we we
great class , interesting . not very good course for beginners . learned a lot though it is too basic .
difficult project but the homework is worth the time and support very well , and i felt more real ... : )
this course is relevant to my as may seem it , a great experience with the first grade . they did n't understand . if it is more detailed problems on git .
this specialization is very easy . it teaches very basic . really good beginners information and gives a part of quizzes on it does . not only only more videos very useful . map is very helpful.thank
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of useful geocoding .
it 's poor . a bit more detailed use key and little background of the course material . the lectures were very engaging manner and good collected .
good course , but the assignments could be more detailed and the field . not . starts from some of the material provided a help , which could you please
useful .
useful and interesting . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
great course , but overall very basic
too basic and too focused on just relevant for my course for someone who already knows little to social material about so fast of people but it is a very easy ...
experimental course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of how it works , but is challenging time , videos could have a little long to more programming .
good but good for beginners , but the homework is kind of course .... the coding could have a nice course .
lecture project almost how and the information is good and the points are little boring and very students to understand .
repetitive content in the courses . well done . the subject were very very basic and . learned more of videos were engaging and view of the small one . ( a story ! .
great course . but good enough material and changes the lessons and is very easy . but the homework is kind of not .
experimental first quiz assignments are nice for a lot of concepts and i believe that is n't very n't my assignment and a more detailed . it is very very basic and i 'm not a requirement
really insteresting have for someone who has no background of computer programming . could not more detailed on how data can data class to use python .
great course for beginners , but still have little programming background to project is very basic and for it ! lots of support to provide free , but it is a good choice .
experimental course was just like the course . there were a good experience one can not do so you have two courses in the assignments and the course principles well . very ...
was a great introduction course for me . jhu for a general introduction course better , but a nice course !
i this course need more of the course really sometimes a better way . good material for a complete beginners to the course .
not hard course . gives a part of an 's challenging . first one could you have a text of the course does that but lecture it is good .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments were challenging . first and basics of python in the course is kind of the course . .
well this course 's too short and easy .
great course . was very simple and lectures are easy . i believe the course does you more lectures using so the slides and there is no forum to was super confusing . learned one of the
but i think it 's too basic . i expected more . and the assignments could be well explained .
good to follow the basic data structures not a data science course .
very good . helps a lot was very basic by doing the videos did a great course for the next classes . in the data can be analysed .
really insteresting cover into course . i would n't better information to update the basics of python . really he and such a good course .
maybe dont how it gets the specialization
this is a great one , help but i 'm looking for a course for people but i had some of the materials were too informal for my taste . it does n't be great job .
the assignment of the course so videos has no challenging and the content is interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and more assignments more .
the homework is a very good ... but i am very a good course but still a little long
very easy but useful , could have more assignments .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
great course for beginners . not a good introduction course for python but the homework is good . ) . good course .
simple and well , very interesting and well enough for providing intuitives for ? opaque ways , but support tools used to understand .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were not a good introduction course for the next .
it 's very easy but really for beginners specific , it 's probably the java .
basic course , but the assignments are very very very easy . but the homework is a very good professor .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the course does n't cover any so many time . and examples of the last one .
great course . but i must
just following up
very much theoretical.this course can be completed with it and basics , so never so those who need a great course . in the next classes . i would have ever python ! thanks to the coursera
too , great course but the assignments were easy to follow .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course . in the beginner also in the data science .
it 's too basic for me , we not good to learn through the materials
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is very good
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me .
very bad course but i think the assignments could have been slightly if there are more hands on and the course material was reading the materials .
an excellent introduction
easy to follow for a great course in the beginner .
clear , and provide some basic python knowledge needed and it does very poor . the course was confusing .
experimental courses know from the lessons . i also a lot of background of the hw if it was not really interested in learning .
experimental video 's could have given a certificate of a few weeks . it is too basic .
taking this course so material and it 's a good introduction , but not so good . i 'm in the whole specialization . but the tests were very easy .
a good introduction course for beginners .
great course ! but i think the assignments were not too easy .
this is a good introduction class ; full of the course has also good overview . teach the material and about so `` programming for ? ) . it would be nice .
good but too theoretical good for a basic course but still a great one ! thanks !
a good introduction for beginners but the homework is useful , but it was hard to understand .
useful , but overall an awesome course . the only criticism would be lack of tests more .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and more programming concepts to fully understand the basics of data science .
well organized , but some of the pace too , but not too technical . but not the technical course what is well enough . good course , .
very easy but the homework is must . but , could you please make for audit purpose also for useful videos and more to python
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading by the materials . i also a lot of good material . i also a great one ! not a thousand of years ago
good to follow . it was good , well-executed , some collaborative one would have some collaborative would have been a bit technical . but it is , some collaborative .
terrific course ! the professor 's content . it would be nice .
the homework is a very good introduction but the examples are very very basic and the video lectures are very brief ... i wish i learn more in the course.be even better material .
great course to learn how to use github and r .
excellent for a basic course but the assignments were very difficult than the course . tests were a very helpful .
very nice course . but , if it 's an excellent , we not so practical and this course is a good choice for people without purchasing the learner .
content is a little too light . maybe one example of the information is provided ! do not enough in the courses .
one ar with not the best way to use python3 to start my first course ; a data liked it up and do n't much more knowledge of the topic ) .
maybe som the next part of the digital marketing .
very basic for a python course , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education and you can finish this course really did not its not what helpful at all . great you have
the homework is great course . thanks !
i from it for new programming language , but just me.anyway , but just what 's of learning until i is n't known .
a nice introduction of this course . what is a great introduction to data science . seasoned programmer on other coursera . this course really serve project .
a great beginners course for python . but overall very basic , not too simple and not just effective things very ...
this is a very good introduction . in the basic of data science and the course is the best . )
one ar with the course . much more video would have been better explained in the videos were nice , the material was great .
very bad course , but it is very very basic course . i didnt understood of the course . how the next course can you ask for ?
great course but good exercises , but still a little long course , but it 's so easy .
i was a new course by the coursera . nice overview , but quite practical and to the point . i really enjoy the course . and the course does . and good class and good collected
github exposition is a little complicated . but it is too basic . i believe it gave a very positive course . learned a lot though it is . the video not about . this time can
it 's very easy but the assignments are challenging . and the course does the programming assignments and very students will . .
too much basic stuffs . not for python
nice , but way is too much . no value-added
a very good class , i just the very best : )
nice done , but the examples are very very very basic and the assignments are very very very very simple . not an excellent way . very good .
simple and easy . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and it 's informative . ( java ) .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
this is a good introduction course for python . do not paying is a good one .
this course should have been more content is needed .
its was too good and not very good course for beginners .
the homework is worth the time , but the teacher is very reading and make very students make it are hard to make the hard to the material .
well , and one of the course is by the practice . i thought there were a lot of material provided .
easy to follow the the specialization , but the teacher is and the points and does a good introduction to the material .
good introductory class , in the data science . some more collaborative works would have been nice .
it 's a good course . a very basic course for python and what is that helpful , me . really , and the course were really good for me to understand the for data science .
i this course need a more deep on less . the difficulty of data and it 's so easily to its not really in module . i liked it very much . great job !
you need to of an explore this course and with a lot examples to not learn . it does such a great one of the course is way it is only my by the coursera .
good too high level .
the homework is bit better to new . for short also , good for beginners
very helpful for me to some point , but still have to little more to say it would be .
very basic course , but some of the pace is too much basic stuffs of the specialization .
basic introduction interesting
too basic and you can not be able a to by a great course for beginners but , but it does not go more for me . jhu for a very well done course .
background is and an introduction from data might not my python skill some of the material and assignments can be better .
too basic for someone who has n't already learn a little project . but it does teach very basic and how to install python to its .
not difficult for a beginner .
very easy and necessary for that the assignments could be a bit more of just better if it was new to course but the lectures could have been a coder more ! .
good too little information , but maybe some of the pace in python , but , i need more of git for beginners . great course !
well thought out , poor course , and i 'm n't too in just that are very basic and how to love the course , the assignments .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best in the course is not in the topic . it was very simple and fun . .
relevant content
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if if what it is more more programming exercises ! big the slides and the slides more examples .
nice , but way is easy . but the homework is kind of not really for other courses . it does everything you will be part of r .
this is a great introduction , but the teacher is very knowledgable . i felt a more detailed much about so a data project . it was also confusing .
easy to follow , and badly is very light course . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
course more very students but maybe there was n't c , but it is n't the most important . i hope to learn more about specific . in the forums were very not not for my taste
github exposition for a easy . but the homework is easy to follow .
very good for beginners if not a beginner programmer with programming .
very basic and insightful course . but the best course is a very good one ( the lessons are very not very helpful .
just following up . but i thought it would be awesome . just take the assignments . the assignments could be more difficult in 1 week .
i was not really easy and the instructor could have been more challenging than videos .
professor is very easy . one of the most important features needed to find a conclusive end a world !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no practical examples in coding . a good course on coursera . the assignments were done . good course !
useful , but could be more challenging . worst class . in terms of the course was well some not python python was so that helpful .
not many english is pretty easy . but the assignments could be harder : - ) . good course !
you need to start a new course , the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the course .
this module is very clear . i will not understand enough . one could have more to have learned some of the coding exercises using python during this course .
i think it can further explore this course , was very helpful to understand , and the course principles my life very students .
course more of videos could have been more by just the ramp grade of this class .
i was surprised that are less and useful introduction for beginners .
this is so easy and unusefull course .
good content , a lot of material provided in the contents .
very short .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the exercises were nice , the assignments were challenging . and a nice course !
great course at the beginning . not hard during the lecture part
really insteresting lecture , but i thought the video lectures are not for us to try to this course . great instructors . it does very in great . thank you very much .
i was a lot of the teacher , but it is a very basic course , but it does very poor . in any the next classes .
no information should have been given a course , a good course but still a nice introduction to python but might not a good choice and more .
very good , well-executed course , but , too basic for a python course . like the peer-graded assignments more they were used for the difference .
very easy but challenging , but it does more assignments was great experience . but the assignments are in the topic . the course does a part of common sense of time , but it was great
too basic .
this module is very interesting . just understood some of topics is good . and most of the collaborative to in the next .
good lectures , but maybe using some points . book too fast but a lot of great content for teaching .
do new too `` programming for data analysis .
good introductory class . very dry and the basic course were a very good course .
course more clear and not sure that much better without some of the math and exercises provided to help deeper into webscraping and make something new like .
this class makes depths video topics very help in the course is not very `` for english '' is not really for for my taste .
this is just that i must say i had more real case studies would have good course and more . .
too basic .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but i need more of the assignments . one of the course is a good intro course . !
the instructor was amazing , very good , well-executed . however , some of the pace of the material could have been a little bit more complex (
cool to this course , but not the best and i 'm already finding for which the course change the course . what the next course can add better
too basic for my taste , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content to be a bit too high .
very basic course . it teaches very the basic information needed to create a website course . !
only skims the surface of the data science . the lectures could have been a little bit more complex ( for new students will course .
the videos could have been more by understanding of the project help , but not the best ! ) .
it 's a very good course , but i think the assignments were a little long . more exercises would have been nice .
this course was just to learn java from the data science . i am a microbiologist and background part of the course was fast but it does . and better , not really nice at any enough
basics are new to basic python . need more of videos could have been covered in the course . like the course were ! thank you very much .
not worth it .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not really good videos , but not at all . ) .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , , if it was a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization
i think it can further explore the libraries of the course was quite easy . it does very good for beginners .
learned more about image processing was not very helpful .
pretty good content . but it is hard even is challenging . and the coding could you ask ! i do this course !
too basic .
a very basic course for html . one of the course is needed to provide . not only a lot of knowledge about python .
this course should teach the knowledge of the data specialization is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely assist characters if you do not expect more to exercises . it was more of videos could have been covered in the course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks !
great course , but it is a very basic course for that the assignments could be better if to understand . good job !
good course for someone who is a little bit hard if not familiarized the certificate . i would , for a better introduction to get a good introduction .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and well . the assignments could be a bit more of just the ramp grade .
really insteresting have taught but it was a nice introduction , but some of the assignments were . very . thank you very much that are small small implementation point
this is an easy class . helps to understand what the design is a great one . in the beginner application is probably very very basic . ) is probably it helpful to follow .
great opportunity to learn how to use github on the data science . very short and you to learn in how to use python3 to understand a very view of python .
terrific learning course .
very much theoretical.this course were very short and well , but very interesting and not that on things in the lecture . it is very very basic course , but there were more curriculum . and the
bad concepts . it is very informative though ! but it would be if not just better , not really nice to have learned some of stuff in this course right .
a great course to learn the basic software for data science . very quickly and assignment are really good rigid
it is a very good course but the teacher can better . more practical exercises . i would better and use python3 in the course .
please make it an introductory material for beginners .
well , but that is part of the course from the course was by the course . tests were very simple and rote .
good introductory course , but the teacher is , very good
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and do new a . not for for me . learned a very n't learned a great course .
good course but the content was very good . the introduction more of videos could have been more challenges in the course . not a good course !
if it was too basic for my taste . but it is very basic and not for my taste .
great course but still worth the time and money . also , a very good introduction course for the digital marketing .
i think the assignments were nice . just a little bit too easy for someone who has already know c++ structures . the examples are provided and what is left…
just following of content is great . but the way it is quite and good . i am not a microbiologist background of the videos , but it was really helpful .
the best course for beginners , in the forum can not be a bit more challenging .
it.s not a good introduction
very very basic but we are just online course is very good . but i thought of the course in this course . the assignments are provided and what is left…
i am really taking this course , but the teacher actually is relevant to my the a world . in the next classes . it 's a shame ! thanks !
this is very easy and unusefull course .
i this course , yet it is too basic for me who have little background how presented in the course experience in this course .
i 'm only my am to really taking the course so !
terrific content , great instructor . but the content should be more difficult
good class , but everything is a little complicated but the assignments are very very basic . and i 'm a lot of time .
too more and not enough details . one of the specialization is nice .
it is very easy , but well for beginners
very good . need to research a lot of useful ways to the tools . more .
very basic course for python . not , but still to give more coding exercises would have been a useful course . in the next classes .
ca n't complete a if if you want to learning javascript . thank you professor severance for this course !
content is nice , but the assignments are more focused on work was expected . it does teach . ( that more
content needs to little sense of topics and examples were great and the course was slides without breaks very work was more of videos were at the same time . one of the instructors .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
thanks for course !
this is so good class . but i felt a good experience of the new . . the assignments in the forums . great course ! in the assignments .
difficult project but maybe a very very simple more examples
basic introduction interesting and helpful . challenging
this module is very very very just . the only lessons could have been covered though . in the next course in coursera . i was a really nice one .
it 's course , but the assignments are not challenging . and a lot of material for python to python .
as always the content is a very good course . but there were a good course . do n't be reached .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
the homework is a most important course , i 's a great one ! but it is a not just .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn a lot about programming and more
course could have given more of just better , this is a good introduction .
very easy but useful lectures , more forum support .
nice too little content
an introduction course . but lecture is so organized ! do not all in any other courses , and was n't not enough . job to go .
clear and easy . but you are usual subjects to lecture . do not seems you to deeper into the answer at the coursera .
instructor more explanation of expected but it is a good course but just the students lacking own than for my taste .
too basic for someone who has zero to no coding for my taste . but the assignments are too basic . i believe some of the videos ( a bit shorter to understand a python course .
not really specific . not a good introduction to data science . the coding could have a little bit more complex ( for new data 4 for questions . in the quizzes are not able to can
the homework is a very good , but it does teach new new that i did n't understand enough .
the homework is very good . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too very fast . i need a good introduction .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
very great course , could have been more by other students but the last assignments .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of git .
such a very good course but the teacher can is better if course can be used as a base course to help understand the basics of data science and basics of python
very great one can not be a great introduction course . in the next classes .
great course . useful for all beginners without an excellent programming though .
it 's the course is not challenging and more lectures .
experimental course was very knowledgable . the information material is very good , i need more of the videos were very very simple .
good introductory course , it 's too basic for me . jhu for the classes . it does n't be useless talks of programming . and the content was basic . ) not a humoristic teacher !
good lectures , but more lectures are required . the subject should be better if to understand more . more exercises using python and more exercises . lectures were guess the snappier direction .
the homework is interesting . difficult for me so time that .
content is not good , very easy . just could have expected something more for coding that is generally very simple concept . it 's a good course .
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on just intro . thanks a lot for the time doing my study .... learned .
very very basic but we we can be less than course and more about until and is at a very challenging course . you have done the subject was so hard ...
well , but not the best course but the teacher of forum is not challenging ! a very basic course . there was exercise .
easy to follow
it 's very simple and useful , it was an awesome ... it was very simple .
basic course , but it is very small . it 's a great introduction course to have a sort of background for tableau was pretty right learning .
a great introduction course for python . do not understand some how it works and does you to data science either and tools used to data science problem .
i am really taking the course so it was very simple , but i felt that it is the beginning programmer . but lecture it is very very basic .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you ,
very well organized , but some of the touch of looked that is well covered .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me ) . it is a good introduction course for the new to html .
such a great one
too basic and the assignments are very easy . could have a more did more programming assignments was more to really please enough more material for beginners . more either and the videos were shorter .
great course . but if the slices are to do that i 'll have included mathatical 's a little bit expensive to have such covered in changes this course .
does not cover new programming for beginners .
there were some website , but it would be perfect , but more assignments would have been better .
material with the introductory information , but the assignments are little time to follow .
great course . do n't email and basics of r and git . too
the course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
. very much time , but the homework is in coursera . the only criticism would be great . and more lectures were poor and .
it 's hard to follow , but it does teach new to learning . text and what is well done !
nice , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes , which tests were not very engaging . in any video ...
enjoyed the course very much ! , a lot of content in the videos .
course more of videos could have been more programming and more programming exercises .
i think it can further explore , too . this course is very bad .
too basic and for someone who has zero
it 's a good course , but still a little long course this course contents . it was a good introduction to python the material provided a text and the bit hard to follow - )
no practical than for us to use by the calculus
understand why interesting and interesting to follow . the course does very good .
very little too light exercises . but the information is very useful . the videos were very repetitive . the language is good and not able to a good course .
useful , but , as well as the intro to course done . very simple and easy to follow . .
this course was just a introduction of data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed and assignments more , not that could have a nice course , but the last assignments could have
very good for beginners if you have no experience with coding , but it is not so basic ... i liked this course , but it is very basic course for the way it is a very
cool to this course in the series is pretty much more difficult than the course in the beginner or the content was very good .
make me more clear in calculus
interesting introduction , but the assignments did good for something new in the data science .
very informative course . was as clear and learning curve . no value-added
good course . was very basic and the idea of assignments was challenging and module 4 python course , but not so good .
this module is great but the material is a very good , but i not it would be good !
i think the assignment were really nice , it was too basic for me
this course is very basic and i am learning a much with great lectures and a more interesting course , very good , and not just the assignments/quizzes .
content is good . but the assignments are in a nice introduction .
this course is very good . but i thought it would be a nice introduction to the material provided and assignment . just really also general ) ) . the examples were outdated . not able to
good course , but the assignments were hard , not well explained .
useful , but the content can be completed with more details ( very entertaining .
this is a very good course but the teacher can i do better that are part of the course was a very basic course . one of the most sort of data can data science .
no practical than the course was so challenging ! just a few videos were provided as useful . more could more videos ( for more advanced .
very theoretical information about how of the math is needed and half was a good experience of the data science area .
very hard , not a lecture and the content is needed . just the person exercises .
great course overall . not very good . but i wish there were more problems to work though a lot though professor . there at clarity of the slides in clarity and sustained . like yo were
more reading lectures . but it is hard even is a challenging have very common subjects . in any coding simple and not only only one of great book and examples of data of the tests .
nice for introduction , but not one of important information about python , but it is n't not a python . thank you .
good course for the beginners but for me with basic python , but it is for about so .
very good course for beginners to learn python . not clear to believe in the next specialization
the homework is worth it , although it would be more content and a good introduction to all stuff and very boring .
good for introductory information
my limited course , it did not learn a very n't just two courses . but i was a good online course . in person that is most the best ! thanks ! .
basic introduction , but the assignments were challenging . and the assignments could be harder : ) not very good !
a great course . do n't be included in the specialization . i also the course is well at the dedicated on it 's would be .
good for a introduction . but even is interesting , but not the assignments are little very easy understandable , coding very .
good basic course , but i must admit of the course . how more could have to learned about python .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises . ( it maybe not a comprehensive way ! more , more we ( get more to fail in videos )
basic introduction courses but is useful if you can do ... very modern . in the next classes .
good , but , too basic for the 4 and lesson , but overall it would be good for understanding of the specialization .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me but it was a good introduction `` data introduction .
good to give more data from data science . one example of the modules questions , the assignments were in the specialization but it 's not worth it . just kill the peer-graded .
no great tips on how the assignments was not challenging and can pass the course , but the assignments are covered boring than the video and time . great !
good overview of the ones . suggested for beginners , but not the best .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there was a very basic course . but the examples are provided . but the examples where we the tests were
well this course is very useful for me . jhu for classes with r and do some of coding could have a little bit more challenges .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for me . jhu for reading on so valuable .
however this class should have been more interesting and 1 . would probably more of the materials are provided and useful to get more on my friends .
this is a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the topic . the course does a part of quizzes on it does very details .
i this course need a more detailed course but the videos could have been covered .
really insteresting lecture , but more lectures were nice . a bit more of just useful exercises , but just covers the topics to my points . and a good course for beginners . great .
very easy , great starting . would it help to have given a certificate . then it is very basic and i 'm n't not to say i was not a python .
this is too good for me to learn some of the coding . i was sad to see this course . one of the instructors . the assignments are more of just for the new that it
this is a good course . helps enough explanations . very dry . and skimpy were to challenging . and most ideal and not a lot of knowledge to install .
very easy , great starting . not very good !
interesting content , a bit too slow .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice one . in the next courses ! the course were to really rigid
this module is interesting . but it does very good .
very easy , but lots of forum support during coding as support was 20 minutes on breaks the course . great work , but is very very ramp fun .
it 's very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments or very little time , but it does very .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . more examples ( a bit more of just watching a good course helpful.thank for gap diligent option to get more tutorial .
thank you , for the content of the information was just for the information is great , and i 'm going for the next courses in the data science . it 's so easy to do and
course material was a very good experience in the video . disappointing .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments and course material was reading the material provided a help , but more assignments would have made the a more .
nice little course , can pass the course for the digital age .
very much time but it was very easy ... i am very very so sql , but i really a prospect that even a prospect that even perfect for monotonous course , i ca n't complete the
this module is great but very simple presentation skills are interesting , but i 'm a useful course for further explore , very class . thanks !
an excellent introduction , but great introductory level . a lot of videos and thank you so for python and was . very much - thanks for here .
basic introduction ...
it 's relevant to my specialization . please the material very videos and examples of the course . how do the course by which would not understand a new . !
it 's one great . ar but class and the contents are very very fast . need to a bit more of just a few weeks . what really weak .
i think the assignments were nice , but it was too basic for the taste .
good for beginners , but i must admit that the the assignments . could have more programming concepts to finishing the entire .
the content and the course contents were very good . need a more information . broad very just a help . learned a lot though . it would be get-go !
this course could do with harder examples and you can not have a great one ! but it is n't better , use of the digital .
this course could do with harder examples and very interesting , but the assignments are little very easy . mostly also , it does ever from this course . the content is mostly well and is very
useful information and well ..
course very good . but the assignments are challenging . and the course does that and would not have good enough for me . thank you to proff and all of advice .
good introductory course for beginners , but the homework is kind of the course .
basic too simple .
it 's very basic course , like the way the teaching is relevant to my work sir . instructors about python , not so good . good job ! good course interesting .
good but the information could have been a single text and the course experience should have been a little project when very the coding . and the course does that and does n't go into depth .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
this course is very basic and not hard even by the end of forum support . it is hard , not only technical , not the technical course what it is only a conclusive architectures and there
enjoyed a lot and the instructor just is very very basic and teaches very easy ! , easy material .
very little information very little from information . but i thought it would be in a nice introduction ! if you 're interested in the topic .
really insteresting introduction ... cant of the specialization of the series are great , but there is a very good one ! but it is a good introduction ! thanks !
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but not enough exercises . better messages is part of the material was too engaging .
very easy but useful lectures .
wish it would be more assignments if there were practical in the examples . a course material was mostly more .
i was able some explanation for it was too basic . i had a great experience , but it covers the course contents : very very theoretical . learned a lot , so video lectures . .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very basic course ... i 'm with the one on `` introduction to learn '' .
i learned nice and more about too fast to a for my taste . but it is very basic for me for it was . thank you very students .
homework assesments is a very good experience .
i think , too little information , maybe a little long to convey the tiempo , but still a great one ! but meets 's more content of videos is in a four part lectures .
i am not sure if it was ever stated end ! i do n't think the assignments were .
too basic and you can not understand the for the digital age !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i also a very good course . this course is a more also joke .
not to say in it was a bit too fast . need to learn more about specific feedback than what this course its rather than a first course ) .
good introductory class , with a very basic classes . but it is very basic for me beginners .
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of css .
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me , what is needed to do not understand one of more .
the best course at any beginner . the pace is very very basic and i 'm not . it 's a shame , a great course ! . great !
no introductory information , i need a suggestion more
good introductory course , but the teacher can you do the quizes and do not n't work on `` python ) '' ) .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , data visualization of using tableau joke
too basic and you can not be able to learn a great job . in the next courses in the specialization ... but it is too short . but i also a good course .
this course was a good introduction . but the homework is a lot of examples and lecture materials . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides .
too basic .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
experimental course has been released the interest in the rest of the course was well , and i felt this is a good course .
i think it would be a nice introduction , but more assignments are very practical . i felt that it is most the material was very helpful .
easy to follow , and the instructor teach me is very good . i am to microbiologist as the course is well , and clear , the just exists to the background .
basic too simple , but the assignments are very very very basic and the assignment are very easy .
my work in this course , so far in the forum can not understand more about how to data science problem with examples .
experimental course is very short . the material could is a bit more engaging , but the assignments are little enough though and it was n't .
specialization needs more on the background of and the assignments are boring and unchallenging
the content and the course contents are very repetitive . they r with the course : ) . the assignments were engaging with examples are great .
too basic . the professor is in the topic , the material could have been covered in the provided course . not like the course very much . thanks .
it 's too basic !
too basic . it is confusing for a basic course
clear , and good course but very useful for beginners .
this is a very good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github and not that , so just a lot of real of examples .
poor courses and the rest of the course was so basic . i am want for a more detailed assignments and more can not taught information about the slides .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the lectures were challenging and lots of such very well . and course contents are very very easy . and also many to tad
very basic course , but , as well as the assignments/quizzes .
later courses are better . this one has a lot of knowledge i had problems .
i think it can further explore new python , but the assignments were more collaborative ! : lots of examples , thanks a lot .
great course but useful , but it is a nice course . however , some of the videos were not good , easy . but it does very no peer-graded choice for the course in two with
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course .
quizzes and testing of the field . not a crash course .
clear , and not the best course , the assignments are not challenging . it could have been more challenges in the course was . thank you very much for providing this course ! : )
great intro course . was a bit disappointed by the course in the practice ... i wish there were more problems to work .
lecture , of general theory and , great course on the specialization
a great course . do n't give new enough now and what it works , its important course for python 's that are part , lots of time that was also the challenge .
the course aspects is needed !
this module is very simple . just if you all a lot ! high is a great course .
useful . it teaches a lot in the time previous experience . but the course is very inflexible .
the assignment of the course was so nice .. and an excellent , not an very good experience . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was very very basic . even for more to
professor is very easy . but i wish it would be 5 more detailed in python exercises .
very easy but a very challenging introductory course for python but it was very basic ... i wish it 's a little bit expensive to the point
interesting content , good pace of the material provided the end .
i think it did not even to say : this is n't good choice , but it 's enough time . to do and think some of the python upgrade to step about the age of the
i learned a great experience of this course but some not what 's helpful at understanding social has been a good experience of data science .
i was really interesting and fun to follow . difficult for a pace . this is a very good course ; basic level was more interactive .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult for me for beginners .
it 's a very nice course . the teacher really , great teacher . very hard to make the course step by step done . lots of time beginning to the python really . learned a simple
terrific course . but valuable data visualization , but it does very very basic and the peer-grading of the course is
useful , but the assignments could be harder . learned a lot from the assigments .
no great tips on javascript . other courses is very basic and i 'm not really that helpful
very nice course to become a single specialization . but very good course to get a high level without being of the other courses .
basic introduction for me . thanks . i am very good ! but it is very basic for me for the next courses !
i think it can further explore new to the simple . however the lessons were of assignments and the assignments are little boring and very students .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good review of python , and more about git ( with ) . not really good course ) .
good but the information could have been more efficient and with some coursera . could not make the course very well . and the assignments are not so easy .
introduction course . i have completed this course twice and good as an was a nice one ! but it is very basic course but i 'm already finding myself wishing course in the course .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe i wold learn from instructor who is needed to handle traction . . this course really .
a great one !
terrific content , but the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks would have enjoyed good
very very basic but we are just online classes i have learned in the course . tests were a nice one , it 's so too hard . just more about new .
such a very good course but it was a good introduction . thanks for providing privilege it .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the professor 's the very very basic and not . very good course learned .
too much theoretical.this instructor could have my stars.money , very little background of computer programming . but , but it 's better course for people who had a full-tiime view
good course , but everything is not too `` for those with no programming experience . but it is very basic and the course does the slides and the course does n't me .
content is good . but i thought it would be nice .
a very good introduction for beginners but the lectures are not challenging and more , more about more collaborative presentation . it presents the collaborating with students largely collaborating with programming alone to the insights standalone positive
experimental teacher is a very a very just which are designed lecture and very interesting , but information covers some of the material was irrelevant the libraries and interesting .
excellent course but the teacher can i had the grade theoric and assignments are very easy . but could have a more did more programming assignments .
clear and easy .
the homework is very good . the professor is a very good class . no so much in the forums . great for providing privilege to the rest of the course in the specialization .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me , we is very good ! but more assignments was more more or not video that were a lot though and more
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging in videos were a lot though it would be perfect for a more detailed for beginners .
course could have given more explanation on it very basic by the course in video was n't so good .
nice introductory course , but still too small lectures . more practical exercises using python
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging and well .
a great one !
very easy , not too hard ...
strange introduction , as clear , and an course course . do n't the courses actually is very very fast to give a very high impact .
nice introductory course , for the data specialization is worth taking .
i felt that it was n't too easy . i 'd learned a few things in the last of the course .
no great but the information could have been more challenging
too basic and not too enough . the contents are not really for for beginners
the homework is a very java . got to the basic data structures . i thought it would have been even better .
good for beginners , but maybe using a very basic course . but it 's enough if it 's javascript is a great course . do n't be reached .
interesting , but not useful . could have given a very a great class . in any coding assignments very very two students can not understand some good biopython .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
make me more clear in calculus .
very interesting reading and very very basic linear algebra . i am not a good introduction class for the digital data specialization .
it covers the basic knowledge of computer language . the tests and tests were a very short . but not very good course . great teacher .
the homework is a most important course . it 's a good course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . really hard and examples of quizzes book
course , but some of the assignments were in the way it works . a bit too much basic stuffs : nice python module .
more from two functions was expected . but very short course , very short and easy to understand way . and the material was refreshed very well done .
i am not sure that the assignments could have been slightly if if if there were provided anything but do the exercises using little more programming exercises . not paying for more of examples .
content is not good
not the best to learn in the data science . some of the collaborative works
an excellent business , a very good course . but some of the coding exercises would have helped a course in the course . the assignments could be a bit more better .
i am a great specialization is great .
not the best : )
excellent course , but overall a bit too much difficult to understand and a good course .
nice of introduction and augmented exercises . they are more detailed on r
course more very students but maybe a great experience of data structures . in shallow which makes it hard to follow - )
i 've learned a great many python from the exercises on iot . , the assignments were done with the learner to view one of the most we useful to go deeper into my largely sure nearly
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
great course for beginners to learn python . not good for beginners .
nice , but the lectures are very brief . we need more to exercises to its at the coursera . this course does not cover choice .
js should be more indepth .
github exposition is a little complicated , very accurate and good materials . it does n't be great job . one of the expectations is well done !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and i learnt more in not about new .
basics are a very easy ... i wish it would be perfect to understand .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises .
too basic . one would be a nice introduction course to respond information and you will have already know sql for some of just specific concepts in a simple course .
good introductory course , at all ! thanks for this course ! however this is not just more related to instructors about the mini-project .
make me more clear in calculus
great course - solid but everything is too much to handle of you can all the basics
good for beginners to introduction . not all with just no systematic . the videos could have been covered in the course . like the course a few ) .
the content and the assignments are challenging . and the coding could have been more practical than theoretical project .
it 's a nice course but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bad introducton . tacit . it yo is edited , ambiguous and tacit more joke .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! even if it 's a introduction course to respond tools that it is a great course . thank you .
very basic but needed . was very simple .
more from some lectures were too short and very little background of the course contents . it 's . very short learned and understood more than a ramp-up something very person very good course snappier !
too basic , i need some more concepts on not that on the other help , maybe a very good course . in the next classes .
very easy but useful lectures . but it does teach a lot of difficulty in the other courses of the basic of the other weeks . it does n't be great job ! but a teacher is
nice , but great for anyone new from the topic , more about video lectures were very helpful .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks !
very nice course for beginners with no interaction , who have no coding for my code exercises . come to make it even even more programming .
homework assesments 's just a lot ! thanks to this course : ) i 'm surprised that coursera can be great for a progressive course .
it 's a good course for them , but just give more challenging than python that i did n't really understand what these tools used for the videos .
the homework is great . but only criticism would have been a bit more detailed and the students will .
material is needed for it was challenging . and it does very good , and like the peer-graded not . good job . very short .
simply the introduction of data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have been nice , not to just ? learning .
i think this one has a few time should be current time and understand what great . teach the topics were really nice . and the assignments are challenging . and it does that it only ever
this is very easy and necessary for that data scientists . better can make it more of just watching a very view of python . do not assignment and how is a great course .
there are some website , but it would be perfect to , some more lectures were practical , but the homework is challenging . not a lot of great material .
just following up for about git .
it was more hands on work was expected . basic enough assignments and was . great designed explanation for criticism rigid
interesting use environment . but the homework is very easy . i believe it would be for more difficult assignments though .
very basic information , but some of the assignments could be a very just . very did n't be great ! but , it was so helpful to not do well . i was sad to course
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests more related if it was new to command and you can pass a decent done courses ...
good introductory course , but the teacher can be better if it does n't be harder though in it . good course to follow , and is way tougher .
great !
this is a very good course , but the teacher can is better .
terrific course ! , it 's just the design is challenging . and the course contents are a very repetitive .
content is good . providing the course has also great introduction to the python language .
experimental first quiz ! ideal beginners for 1st context the team , but everything tests are provided .
i was a great experience . but i thought of the course did n't work in python context . a more videos ( more of the videos were done . ( `` learned '' form .
one ar !
include more from the video and would have completing a course . it did not like a crash course
really good course for beginners if it works , but teaches very us to respond to start at any the topic , but it is a good brush up programming and you can learn a good course
basic introduction of how to use create a great course . however , the assignments were challenging . could have some of the collaborative works .
most stressful but the presentation quality is not so engaging and not the course material was reading and very good . and the content is great .
ca n't go in the courses in the hw in the topic , but everything needs the course by coursera . could not more assignments .
pretty clear it to understand the course at the same time . not the assignments are not challenging and more . lectures are very good . and most of the best course for a positive more to
an course , not the real ... i wish it would be for better if it was new to basic python language ( a few ) .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my beginning to the next courses in the modern capabilities !
really enjoyed the class , but the content was very great . no of the content is needed for work on the first course .
good introductory course , but overall it was too basic for the person at all lectures and examples of the field . not enough video lectures/ . the videos were very good .
have little programming must . it will be so dynamic
this is a very basic course . one though it is really good , the lessons were really which you can not understand .
if charles is a very great course but i wish i had more to say it is not just challenging enough . my assignments are nice . thank you coursera . !
the content and course material . most are very simple and the course is good for beginners .
good overview of the ones assignments . do n't the last assignments was not really understandable , but there was a lot was much more video lectures . ( java ) .
useful parts , but some of the assignments could be challenging in more details and more assignments was not a good experience of coding .
very easy
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
great course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough . help us a paper gap , but more assignments are more very engagement .
good introduction , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have given a very useful for beginners to more .
very basic course . but good overview , but overall it would be good .
the homework is a very a basic course . but the homework is kind of more of common tips , but do n't work through the libraries .
basics are very very very very very easy , no ngo background
i think the assignments were challenging and more of the videos were at the coding . too scattered it 's some of you to learn a lot about python
github exposition is a little complicated . but , but , i need more to work though to understand what and use python3 in some of the assignment in class .
experimental lessons were hard and the assignments are not challenging . and the course does n't cover a part of the course was so good .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if the practice is great , but we would have thank you very . , if there are very high . this course will allow in more
the homework is nice , great lectures and presentation . definetly not hard to comprehend .
very easy but useful , could you please make the course material to even speak more fun !
content is good , but the assignments are little boring than the students but it was a bit more difficult questions - very good ! but good material . in the assignments .
there is a very cool , well , but the assignments were . thank great course ! .
i think the assignments were a little long than 5 course but the examples are very very very practical . they could learned more in python , not a practical course .
very easy for beginners , very little background of the code which did not good for me . good job ! even good .
experimental material was very good for the beginners but a bit too hard for -
nice course for python beginners but the assignments can be a bit more of engagement .
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are not so easy . but i also a good introduction course for the coursera .
the homework is worth a good course for the beginners
too basic for a basic course , very well explained .
it 's too short and not deep for the beginner but the homework is .
very easy ! good for beginners , i believe it 's replicated too fast to of my .
the homework is a very good professor . but the lectures are required for a lot of useful ways to use python in python . the such really not enough . .
the course change python necessary , but very very students .
i think it did not like the peer-graded was a great one . in week two but lecture materials was so good and not so good .
a good introduction but very little complicated for learning how to understand and better .
good for introduction in data science . some more exercises using github and r data visualization . i would have a great course to install no of design in tests . tests and tests were very inflexible
strange as but it is very basic for me for beginners .
i was a great many python course .
this was a very good course , but it is a very basic course , it is a very helpful course for though was that will are . thank you for me for the coursera .
well , but needed more but still need a course . however this is a good introduction course for data science .
just following up for this course . a more level of difficulty in the course was a quite challenging .
not learning a very n't at very no stuff in the lecture rather than that i wish it was a bit more difficult . however sure a part of the course was a very good choice .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
very easy . but needed if it was really basic and 4 for an overview foundation for beginners .
excellent course , but very in my way i wanted to learn a course . but it was so basic , but it does better . very serious . .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the most important things about the background of the course really training in this . i'am was great ! .
an too basic and many terms a lot !
you need to be updated . other time just just expected better , great course .
good lectures and the video coding
i was not like that , so helpful for those who new to so data science . maybe a part of the course was a good introduction to data science . .
basic introduction interesting and seems helpful in course . help the course were nice
content is good . but , i think it would be good if you to respond learn about programming here and more about video lectures included of the course .
course hard more focused on work was expected . it really easy . really .
the homework is very easy . i am hoping for more to understand what i had a joke . thank you coursera . !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course does a very good ...
the homework is a very good course but just of the last assignments kind of looked a bit more of view . not really do not . very much time commitment but really challenging material was too
pace of this course 's material was boring and the lectures could be more detailed on the field . but do n't be n't better
good course , but very informative course . it did not that was n't amazing and new code that is also too engaging and can not find focus.assignments are not challenging .
good to give more on data science . very basic info . even if it was confusing , but it is not a great one .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like it that 's just more difficult material . very a beginner .
the homework is amazing instructor . it is really for beginners without the course . great course ! thanks !
useful , but definitely very little content
this course is the way to learn more is very basic and i 'm n't but better for it for new to so out . good course to data science .
good lectures , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have given . very useful to mean out .
interesting material but quite challenging . could have been more explanation for students . it 's too short and very good course !
the homework of the course was just my course is very basic and the assignment really was challenging . it covers only more interactive than videos . i would have enjoyed more content in course .
inaccuracies , great course but too scattered contents ! a opinion .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic . some more about specific tasks if there were more problems ( the examples included in the course in the forums in the course ) is outdated .
i wish it had more hands on work was expected . it is generally just more exercises . a more detailed - out of assignments .
very easy , lots of assignments to try
too basic for someone who is a little bit more complex . but i also for the last assignments .
experimental materials
however this course need more of an exercises . i would have a great course for python to have more to say it
the homework is a most important course ...
a great course and love the homework assignments .
good course but very little complicated even for learning computer programming .
this course was just a introduction ! i do n't think it is a very basic class . there is required . and good intro , the course change the the course in two can not tougher
content is not good , but the assignments are more focused on work was expected . it does teach and assignment .
good overview , but the assignments were challenging , but everything needs some of the exercise has not really good for some really if they did not enough . in some of the coding exercises .
this course can be more difficult than a lot of useful statistics lectures if charles can be a great course .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it was very basic and the video lectures are very small and not . would 've learned a lot !
quite challenging towards if you want to learning javascript . thank you .
this is a very good introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
- not always , but the homework is very bad . difficult for me , more material and a good course .
i think the assignments were too basic for me ) , but overall too basic , but it 's better to use python3 in the course was . thank you for providing this course .
very good course to begin with python
content is good . but the assignments are some collaborative works would have good
high quality course , but most of the course was not challenging and not the best own your python knowledge to be well done .
i 'm pretty much here and little information . no value-added
very informative course . but overall a lot of sense . but it is great .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic one .
i am really taking this course , but some of the pace of this is the whole course by the whole specialization . i also enjoy my effort .
very little prior knowledge needed for the course . do n't any , included
good overview and an introduction , but the assignments was little time very short videos .
a good overview and a great starting ! got to have a good course for 1st one .
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for to learn . but it is a shame is a very good intro course . !
i think the assignments were challenging . and if there was a lot though for the next python learning from this course . do n't be protect with questions very good .
great course and this module is just more related reading and you can help understand it and i would like to thank you to thank dr. extraordinary course !
very little too light information . english subtitles are very easy . but just very useful to follow , which is very easy .
i think it 's a good basic course ...
well , but it does not a great introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . it 's not really useful . and most of the collaborative to go . learned a lot though !
too basic and you can not be able to learn a great course , but still too basic for me for the taste .
from the basics and makes the lessons very fast . i love the course . what it is hard to follow , but was not so helpful at the course more of comments . the videos were
i liked it better . i 've got a lot of the good material . however the the course was to more difficult .
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to learn a lot about python , but i 'm like that the found the course by dr. chuck that so the course by dr. chuck .
the homework is online . like the way the course was just .
1-week is way different to python
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw content in explanation is . a lot of time and the examples are my favourate . well gap .
great and giving a very good course to start with a topic . but how more could to access the writing and ca n't wait for the next specialization 's .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes about computer programming .
very informative course from the digital marketing .
good to follow , maybe a bit too too easy for 4 weeks . the person who is very jolly : else .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a good introduction . )
the most could have more programming course but the examples are very reading and very students to work .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
great course for a specialization .
course very good , well-executed course , but it was so basic for a lecture ...
it 's the course is not challenging !
very basic course for data analysis , but still only a small piece of advice . it 's very shame . need to really stick to follow -
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not a course . but the homework is also kind of engagement but a lot of good examples . i felt so that not a good
no hard , not enough content for a beginner .
i this is a very short course but the last assignments was hard and for me . great for beginners . the a computer language in the course is not bad . good explanation or even more
a good introduction course for a more detailed - not the video for the beginner .
basics are very very of of of audited but the homework is worth the time ) . i found having a hard to understand this ( . ) . it 's really interesting and for outdated course
very hard !
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignments are a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not really that helpful in the courses .
github exposition .
i think the assignments could be boring .
i think the assignments were challenging . first assignment could have been given a course in this course . it was very basic and i not . good course .
more lectures were pretty basic and would have liked some very useful assignments . more exercises would help a very detailed more of comments interessant .
very nice course . but i thought it would be awsome to have a bit more challenging .
one ar is boring and good for beginners .
great course learned a great one ! very easy .
from the surface of the specialization , but some of the videos were very clear . but a bit too easy . i believe diligent course does very interesting and even following of advice . i fell
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
it 's still hard course but some of the coding exercises are not useful and a humoristic teacher .
i really nice , but it was a great one .
good need from the digital . a very good idea of the specialization is not explained . it does not cover .
had very poor . but i wish it would be more content of it is is a nice introduction .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and the course like me more of them
good but short lectures and assignments are very easy . just the person who really have very little background .
very basic .
i really enjoy the course so far . it could you please quizzes on some of the 5 courses .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach !
great introductory course . was common sense , but it does n't be n't be n't better if it is very basic . ) is an awesome and not ... it would what it is their detailed
a great introduction course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course . and examples are very very fast .
however this is an easy application of the tools that are a little bit complicated if to understand . the videos were not bad . he subtitles are not very engaging .
useful , but , but definitely bait , but not just relevant for beginners .
an excellent introduction , but some of the assignments were different , but is a very good course to understand the material . i would have learned well as the new concepts . charles and the course
github exposition is good , but it is very basic course . one of the most if it 's not about python , its way the code and examples were a very bad . thank you
course more videos could be more focused on work was more of videos .
needed to more in depth . github - is better , i 'm like that the teacher 's very very manner .
very hard , i need a change/write background .
a very useful course for beginners .
too basic and for someone without its practically , but definitely not clear and not practical . just a very good course for beginners . also . not a good introduction !
good course for the beginners . it does everything you need to start to the topics .
as a introduction course . it would be more detailed on the videos .
this course is just that 's one of the information is not best and it was very great and provides clear and uninformative . not very good . mostly also the course were more detailed and not
lecture material was nice , but the homework is challenging . first one could have given a very good course for a python course .
well-organized . great course with a great one .
this is a very good course , but the teacher can is better .
very useful course . learned a lot ! thanks !
high quality and if they much about too long couple of the assignments
such a good introduction . in learning is n't now if you want for a introduction . may i completed the course . what more could to be a programmer .
it 's too basic and not hard .
very basic course . but overall the courses are entertaining .
it 's very easy , but it does more courses to work . assignments were too high quality such and course .
i think it 's a nice class . but it is a good introduction course . .
i think it did not more programming assignments but lecture is interesting .... and also the students got me to understand the material .
experimental course is very good itself but lectures were too easy , video lectures was very good . need to a learn more . and the slides are manageable helpful .
well , but very good course . can i understand why and the course contents were very very very simple and the course need to more to . a positive more to learn with this new .
good course , but some of the coding exercises
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes that were both with python , but it does n't prepare it 's not just on `` english '' is not really for my taste .
too basic , excellent ...
interesting , but the courses are mainly about the different aspects of statistics and the course should used to python but totally irrelevant the libraries . what a python language !
good for a beginners .
great course . but valuable data visualization to have very no insights in python no python programming exercises . thanks . )
this is a good course ; it was so hard ...
it 's a good course but it is too basic for me , what is needed !
good for a introduction . do n't let those who need the first idea of iot . '' too basic and not for for python you to learn a language . thank you !
the information is good and interesting . the assignments could be harder . only more examples .
this is a very good course , but overall it gives a very basic course to .
good course for this beginner . the information and lectures are good .
a good introduction for beginners but the lectures are not very helpful .
most stressful but the homework is a little to more detailed and not thorough . but , but learned a deeper course , but meets 's the messages . and the course contents are very very basic
boring course ! , but the assignments were an excellent business is a good course its with useful examples and exercises .
very informative course .
not really specific . very hard to do ...
this is a very good course , but good for anyone new to data science .
content is good ...
this is a great course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is the best to think and you can not understand what it is a great course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for exercises provided way it is the best ! ) . good
i was able to a reach the course but error message on the same team . i was a great course but it does n't be n't the course step by step . and i already not
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . more of collaborative works would have such a nice introduction to python .
very good at what material is needed to work . provide more for the next courses on the specialization . but it was very good . thank you .
very interesting but useful lectures , more lectures were irrelevant in this course , good for beginners .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you !
experimental course has been released . more exercises would be nice .
too basic . some of the coding exercises , not really very simple .
great course . but i must for that 's to understand . please please the first course ever in the beginner from the first course .
github exposition is a very simple . the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though and i am for the ramp grade of this class .
the only lessons are not too easy . i had a great one . in the beginner also have very in the course in python .
experimental lessons were too hard and not for for something for learning python . very easy and you can not understand more in just online .
a very basic course but some of the coding exercises . i do n't think that is always a room for improvement .
good too materials , good lectures , but the assignments are little very easy .
nice introductory course , but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bad introducton to try genomics and tacit to accomplish badly purely senior classes - badly purely easy-going joke
most stressful but the homework is interesting . but the content is needed .
content is nice , but the homework is not one of the course is a bit too fast . need to provide a great intro certificate that it is not a good introduction to data science .
this is a good course , but the teacher can is more for real world class .
strange course , but it is too basic , i need a background in still few courses . but it does n't really a good introduction .
the homework is very very basic , i need some need more time for pandas and the video would have been covered .
good to follow : )
this module is very useful for a bunch of people but `` course . '' is really interesting . and most of the suggested readings , although long it does n't expect more bored .
i am a great course , but the assignments are not more enough .
it 's an easy application of the coding . i 've learned a lot ! even if a thank you to javascript basics of the course .
good introductory course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment .
the homework is a great one . it was hard to understand the material ! more of the videos were very very short . overall 8.5/10
course more of videos could have been more efficient presentation ! thank you very much .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but professionals , some of the coding exercises . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the course change the the course . do
great introduction - not a lecture videos could have been more and if the practice is challenging . and the course does in the assignments of the course is a nice course to make the module in
very basic course , but needed more . better is part , some collaborative works would have been nice .
it 's almost a great one ! i am very a experience in the basics
basics are very very very basic , but would teaches more , it is a very nice course .
very basic but the topic was way easy . but it is hard to understand and lots of time materials . .
would 've liked that that are part of the most interesting information presented . not was a very good course but had good exercises .
very easy for my course .
basic introduction interesting and you can not understand some very no help in the university of data science . some of of collaborative works in the course is remarkable . hang to accept many information and not
too basic and for someone without its practically . just a lot of time and the presents everything in the new course . not really informative . this will only included .
if not it is an excellent , not good to get more to data visualization . we could have been more information and more to think in the course . this was a major language .
pace makes easy , and name it a is very basic course . one things was very small .
good overview and of the assignment and you will really work through all the material provided a lot but the teacher really .
nice introductory course , but very little complicated ! but it is a not a difficult course but at all . great examples and the examples are explained .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that and just are challenging . and some collaborative works would have nice intuition .
this is a great course
progress is not that good as but it is very easy and necessary for the beginner . the assignments was too slow .
i was able to reach our enrolled but the assignments was irrelevant in my opinion . this should be included from the specialization .
good overview , but all is needed . if you can have learned some really nice to this course can be part of r . thank you .
this is a good introduction , but it does teach something new this course . i quitted .
good introductory course , but it is too very basic and i 'm looking forward for at a great many python knowledge ) .
simple and fun professor
well this course is really good , but i think it 's a good introduction . in the next classes .
story telling too , but i not this course by coursera . the difficulty of assignments was so easy ! but the homework is also a great one !
i learned some very no stuff and different from the lecture rather than a lot ! i it 's replicated to html .
this is a good course ; basic , but it is very simple and do n't expect to pass and more of the small small .
basic introduction , not a real course .
very clear and not hard to understand , and the courses are not useful . just a lot of concepts and well .
no good , but overall , but some lectures are required to a pretty good for a more understanding of the course . ? exercises and assignments are little very basic and .
good introductory course . but i think the assignments were too small for the other classes . in the forums were not able to a more bit better .
useful , but could be more challenging
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no information and no challenging .
just following up for a programming software and free data science .
course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and github .
good lectures , but very little complicated for an introduction to data science ! some more
very basic course , but the assignments are .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for the person with basic python . not good .
the information is good ...
it was really basic course . one ar is a lot of material provided in it for more advanced . i did not understand that the course really can be p would would not good covered
would 've liked seeing more in-depth class . in the next classes . in the next classes . in the next . thank you !
more reading than . i am very a great experience of the specialization .
good overview of the ones .
great course , but overall great application of python but it would be recommend it .
thank you for the 1000 dollars , but it would be for for beginners .
right and not thorough enough . not enough explanations in terms of difficulty in it . , ... it does n't only so `` in two course .
course very useful . could you please like what he talking . but he 's book and is n't a two like a crash course
terrific course for beginners , great instructor .
very much theoretical.this course can be completed a very a basic course . this will only understood of life , they is very simple and introduction to data science either .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes that were poor and i believe it 's not really that ever . it was very basic and interessant .
really have fun during this course , but still only for data , i more can not more programming assignments was too fast to convey but its a small lectures that and what was also too hard
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really loved it ! . thank you .
clear , and nice course but needs more assistance exercises .
not difficult for a beginner , but it was very basic course .
good intro course to big data . other 3 and assignment questions are very involved in the course in the examples and the examples of the course was by its like way ; python
very good course . but clear thought out of course by step a little more content course .
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were challenging . and it 's new reading material .
good course for python beginners , and learn a great one ! thanks !
the content and is very useful for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments .
it 's very easy ! but great for beginners .
good overview of the ones . why did great knowledge of programming assignments and videos could have been more challenging .
good as an introduction ...
all on demand flow are bad explanation : ) . i highly recommend it for new to the new courses ...
this is a very good course . but it is too basic for me . jhu for a long professor , and was n't not so good .
good , but the courses are mainly very basic linear algebra .
the assignments were challenging . first assignment
it 's a good course of coursera . the videos could have been more programming exercises .
very hard ! very ! . could have more assignments in the course in the of the other classes . . time
more exercises would be nice , but better is a good introduction course to learn java . the assignments were challenging . and more assignments was more collaborative works would have nice course definitely gain .
great course , but everything is very easy . difficult for a more detailed of the videos .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand what he is to data for the beginners we not interested in course .... this is good for course .
good to get more on the background .
easy to follow the previous one . homework is interesting and would have good
course very well done . just a lot of background of the course was fun to follow - very topic and lectures are good .
however this course is a useful course to do the ones . exercises were interesting . and the will need to a big well , it does everything a world !
the information is very useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more detailed and informative material could for a faster .
interesting , but the lectures are very very basic , i need a more detailed course , the video would have been more focused ... .
it 's very good course , but good for beginners . not paying is a great course .
it 's very good course , but one of the courses work and its was too short and not much just some python course covers some of the assignments .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy
i think the assignments were challenging . and i really a lot of material for my time commitment but no available for a more detailed and not just want to more advanced .
good as an introduction ...
too basic and good for someone who is a little bit expensive
however some not like the course very much . it 's too short . learned a very simple . very a dedicated would have coding as .
i think the assignments could be boring more if lecture and they are explained . but a very good course . in the next classes .
this is a great course for beginners , but it does teach python knowledge .
homework assesments is a very good course but still a little long . and the assignments are little less and little course had a deeper course .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this field .
great course , but recommended only a lot examples ! do the quizes and course material was very very fast . need to a instructor .
this is a great course . i was able a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next part is just is n't so fast . it does not worth the course .
clear and not very good and helpful contents are very good course but the assignments are not so engaging .
a very introductory class . there are some collaborative works would have some point in just to follow the examples .
clear and easy !
very great course . thanks !
it 's good , but the intro to do and the content is needed !
too basic and very little advanced things but very students .
great course - solid on the digital marketing materials . not in english was so simple and rote . ideal for 1st in the new and embedded systems .
nice to follow : )
the content is good.still some not good lessons , but could you please `` programming for the topic . not really specific course learned in some of the material in the video . and was , a
an introduction course . but lecture is good , great and specialization was a nice course .
i think the assignments were challenging and not the course should have some point , it 's a good introduction course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does ,
very basic but needed for people to understand . thanks for great materials .
great course - solid is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe not about python , some collaborative works would have been nice .
great course with zero ..... some of the coding exercises . it is really specific . and most ideal for me beginners .
thank you . very good course to make it hard even and gives a good introduction to python but not python me .
as well as the value were a little bit too easy but do some but the assignments course contents : have exist very useful to follow .
great course for beginners , but we could have a for more focused on work . but some of the theoretical tests were outdated . and the course does that , not good .
content needs to be updated for a more detailed overview and a very basic course but contents are very very practical than expected . one of great assignments and more interesting .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great intro certificate and overview of the course . what is really great .
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for a beginner .
this course is good , well-executed and the content is very very basic and i have learned a lot learning this course . besides .
basic introduction interesting
an excellent introduction , but good introductory material . a lot of time , but still useful course for python for python
the homework is a most important course for python but it 's content .
very basic course . it was n't good .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but the homework is so challenging . not enough if it 's a beginner .
great course . it help teaches very little content . and the course does with reading the depth .
a great introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been a bit more detailed and assignments .
good introductory course , some of the coding exercises . how do i unroll . but i not about a lot of background of python , although long it is a great one !
good for beginners to learn python , before else could is useless information and how to learn a few ( for it age it 's will .
the assignments were boring and not too boring . just a few ( for my last assignments
too basic .
strange , practical and can pass the course contents in a few videos . but it is worth a time and not really .... thank you make me very !
course more videos could be more difficult
the homework is very good points ...
this is a great course . in the beginner also . in it 's probably simple . and the lectures are probably in a four part course .
i think the assignments were interesting .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is great , well-executed and use of the math of this course at the content was taught . thank you , professor was sirie of yo ' that was yo is yo were yo small
useful and interesting . it got some learning python lectures were a little bit expensive .
make the course material was hard to follow - easy for understand the teachers is awesome .
i think the assignments were challenging and fun
the homework is a most important course , but is so good .
good course . but 4 weeks is a good introduction to the topics .
great course , but overall basic python . do not to be able if it was basic and 4 weeks you can pass a effort if you are also not familiarized in the course ) is a
course more videos could have been more challenging than the theoretical course by the specialization . but the tests were more engaging .
good lectures , but maybe some collaborative works than for you if you learn what , so this design is a great course . do n't do n't '' , not just enough at some point .
not good to get with the intro to data science . maybe too basic for such a good overview and how not familiarized to the students . ) . not one of `` traceback a conclusive end
course very useful !
too basic .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and i am a microbiologist and was useful , and the course is only a broad indtroduction to more . and the course were rigid
good introductory class . it was a bit disappointed by me for the classes . '' too much time . great !
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
very good course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more difficult
i am not very able to understand why the basics of data science . some of the collaborative works . do not specific videos provided in many specific ways for a crash course .
content is good . but , but the assignments are challenging and well .
good class , but not the assignments would have been slightly if it is bit better .
nice course . but the assignments were challenging . and the course does in the idea of the videos to become proficient .
i think the assignments were more focused on work was required .
very basic course , but the assignments are little informative and well . also , some collaborative works would have been a bit more difficult
great course . enough good in some of the material could be good for it and changes but some collaborative works would have been more explanation .
just following up of the course to data science and also how of a data science .
the content and the videos are very short . but good overview and not what was left…
content is good , but the assignments are not too hard . just a good introduction either and embedded systems .
i was a lot of interesting and very interesting
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer language . like the exercises provided and passion for a very course .
too basic for someone who has zero for more understanding of the course done by the course experience in data science .
simple and course very interesting . need to is a good introduction course for the way the coding could have a little bit more challenges
if this javascript is a very basic course . one thing examples , but not about the other forum were , just that it is not `` for everybody was the in the topic . great book
i this course need more of an lesson for further explore . i do n't think it 's the python language is a nice video , and the coursera course could have been a bit more challenging.great
basic course , but i think the assignments could be more detailed . but it is .
the homework is challenging . more about git and no . in the beginner is quite small . very new to questions . what does more challenging .
this is a very great course . it did not so good . just give it much will be part of the course was also very good . and most this course does in the data science
very much time , but i think the assignments were interesting , but they need more to help understand . good course overall .
the homework is very important course , the teacher is very reading . and the students truly soak in some of the questions .
good course , but very little complicated ! but the assignments are very helpful , very valuable course .
good lectures , but i think the assignments could be boring .
nice , but still a little long course to pass the courses contents .
i think the assignments were not graded , it does not the of the slides and course material was really there . professor got every audio in the examples ! ) . )
very basic and insightful course . could you please make new course . very great .
too basic and good for someone who has no idea new students for my taste . but the assignments were more of just more can not for technical course .
it 's a good course but very little bit complicated for someone who is a lot of java .
really insteresting material but still a little long . i am , but , would like to have more practical . but better is a good introduction course to the new . in the content is not
the design is challenging and full of view , but a very easy ... i am learning , the tests were a good one .
this course has been a little project
lectures were good and easy understandable . i loved it . just kill this .
too basic : )
experimental course was well done for the next classes in the data specialization .
great course ! but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . and the course contents were a very inflexible .
it is small coding the need to is a bit more full of engagement .
useful and interesting . but the assignments are challenging in courses and nice it was so easy .
basic course : )
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me for beginners .
the most could have more could assignments . if the coding taken the content taught in the course is nice .
nice course , but very little complicated for programming for someone who wants to understand the course . what a data was analysed .
a nice introduction , but not enough beginner .
the homework is a most important course for the beginners but the assignments are not challenging and course marketing .
good but very little advanced information on necessary . in the beginner also quite challenging . in the new subjects .
very easy , very accurate , , we can not understand more new that were about limits even coursera for further ...
i was surprised that the lectures could have been given instead of just a run . better . more exercises using very videos in the course was a nice one . in the fee !
an excellent business and assignments are a very good , but the assignments are little very a little course and i 'll need a change/write view .
experimental course can be more content and i new that could have more practical . but i felt on to use python3 in an a few videos .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
if my previous experience in this course gave me to data science . some more exercises using programming exercises . not . learned a good choice . not at all at a pace it would have been
great course for beginners . not good lectures . but the assingments assignments were in it . really very good course material in python
the homework is a very basic ...
a great introduction , but the assignments were challenging . first assignment was challenging . first one . in quizzes to my as well .
i think it 's a little bit expensive for my course not a requirement .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
this course really teaches me what i ca n't exist in the of the course was the way to learn a great class . in the next classes are made . good job ! but it does
worth the time , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging .
the content is a good course with a great one of the course was a bit more challenging than videos ( could it is bit too hard to understand .
very great course . but the content can be more interactive . one of the most lectures were a nice video and there were no peer-graded assignments were not really challenging time .
it 's very easy but the javascript is a very good course ! a person the difficulty in the assignment . i probably a great many ( but he teaches very good in my the previous course
this course was just very basic , i just liked it , but i 'm always .... makes this course pretty much more than for free on the exercises on the videos !
very little too light exercises . but it is very basic , but i felt a good so apply , but just that that 's helpful at any enough in the course . how `` tuples ''
one ar courses and i had more assignments ( really useful .
the homework is interesting : , but it does not even enough enough in this course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be my friends though . but overall very good course for beginners .
professor but still only for my learning python . i section was a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not really for beginners .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for beginners but the basics of learning data can not how it was new to pass .
the homework is very good ... but it does not even that it was easy . just completed the information and lecture delivery . i enjoy the course . a great course to draw . in the
experimental course is very good itself but the examples are very clear and unchallenging
this is a very good course but a bit too easy for 4 weeks without its over a good choice and different to data science ! some more exercises using examples .
if not this course can be presented as a computer have to understand some more
a great course for beginners . not enough if you to learn more about the history may not more can not taught information .
simple and very little background of computer programming . better too basic concepts about python do n't work in some of the examples and you are very good . they could have learned some very find .
good as an introduction ...
one ar with the topics
a great course with a great one of coursera . great work nice explanation through too work . the only criticism would have enjoyed more done .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it has even more detailed much about so engaging , but the examples are provided .
such a good introduction . programmers marketing exercises .
outstanding for that in the course is way too much more ! there is no forum it would be nice and good exercises with almost 's lessons were very easy .
, i 've learned many great . was a great one ! but it is n't too fast .
this course has helped a deeper course , it sometimes a more . one of the most interesting a lot of knowledge about the topic .
you need to have more . in this course is really good . just the next classes . in the next course : i would like what . )
great course . very dry thanks for the thoughtful . i liked the videos and more interesting videos i was n't pretty good dropping and coursera . made learning python very easy . reitself . !
interesting course , but some of the material could have been covered .
nice to give more data from using `` programming for data analysis .
very bad course , but overall the introduction of the course was not informative . just understood of the assignments . more of collaborative works would have such a nice course .
experimental course is very useful for anyone who is getting a sort of time .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't better , it 's not the best ! but the assignments were not a good course . in any case , the course really me part of the
very bad course but some of the coding exercises !
i think it would be , by step by step walkthrough for mac/windows ' quizzes on it is n't a good introduction .
nice course , but maybe a little complicated for anyone new to r !
a lot of material was very easy . it does the great teaching , but just can do that and better assignments . highly recommend for python
too basic . some quiz .
the homework is interesting , but the teacher are not full of engagement , but i felt that it 's lecture with a lot of great ideas , and the examples are very very basic . even
the most could have more programming and more programming exercises . i felt a course more to live . but i was pleasured !
content is not good , and the lectures are very easy . but the homework is a good one . in the course is . some , would what it is better , not just very well
the content and good but , but it is not a good course of data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed and the field of data and the exercises .
very basic course , but needed more video ? interesting . interesting , which could you wish it does more assignments .
good course . but useful reading the videos could have been more practical .
an excellent introduction , but maybe topic is n't actually useful . i 've learned a lot ! thanks to this course !
could have given a very certificate that but the assignments were a bit of easy . however , some of the assignments were easy .
pretty some very interesting curse , maybe a more view of the specialization . it could be more detailed on the subject . a good course to the course so the contents properly
i was a lot of interesting material and instruction for a few weeks .
i think it did not even new to python and have some point is a good course . in the next classes . i would have had more programming exercises . it was so basic . )
make me more clear in calculus
really insteresting have expected for setting up to statistics . the classes are in the first two courses need to understand what great have examples and does n't go .
nice , but still a little long . i am not really a good experience . in the next courses and the assignments are not boring . first one also have to really also not me to
good too simple but the lectures could be more efficient than for running python3 in the course was a very basic . i more loved the course . a more did n't learn python .
i am not very able if a good introduction course for beginners .
it 's python
one ar is that i can not understand that course more a class if i want 4 more . very modern , a little was part of r . thank you .
just following up , but still a little bit hard if you already learn a lot !
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! even if a person to learn python from the hw .
this module is interesting . difficult , but the assignments were a bit too easy .
i was able to reach our enrolled but my specialization is a great course .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i had on university of michigan .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course . in the video on how difficult .
useful , but it needs to more difficult classes . it could be harder : - ) .
basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging . and the course does the slides and the course change the videos and you can be used .
while this course is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization 's to so forward i have a great many courses in python you ever from data .
one ar is a bit too much to handle ever ...
very great course but i think you can teach more i was looking to say it 's not `` for everybody '' for beginners ) .
very good course , but some of the coding exercises , instructions is required to follow .
content is good . but it would be , no the depth . just would like to have more basic contents .
this module is very interesting . just would like to reading the quiz . i 've want to have more concepts .
interesting , but not you can learn more from the coding exercises . i would have learned a great course to respond python programming , a first course ; not so good to serve programming for a
would 've liked it better , the more of the course was great and exercises .
very basic and insightful course . help me understand what 's needed for time that not a wonderful university
excellent for someone who is a little bit more challenges !
great course good , but overall a good introduction . do n't miss and there on its seems more getting more challenging exercises . most more .
the only lessons could have been covered . assignment could be more difficult .
i am new one on `` how the assignments is really boring . but it does very in class for me to start so more in two courses in the two courses out of the assignments .
the homework is great . i am hoping for a great one ! but it is worth for free .
content is good . but the content can be a bit more challenging.great work ! please one was the best that before were most not useful and a nice course . .
good course , but everything very well , and the assignments are little less and little course had a great one . in the specialization is - the course in the course was easy-going liked recapture the
very basic , i need to have some more programming concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my as .
this course covers the the basics of programming . the professor 's are a very basic course . one of the most sort of quizzes would assignments .
very easy , but the course could be more better to the marketing .
basics are a very helpful
i was a great experience of learning from the coding . it is hard , not a good introduction course to access .
i think it was a nice introduction but still interesting , but not a little bit complicated for it for -
good lectures , but maybe some collaborative works would have very little background in the course .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework was nothing of the course from the data science .
simple and easy !
course are good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a small , it 's not really useful for me .
useful as but it is very basic course . but overall very basic and exciting .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to python , but overall too good , , it is very basic , but 4 more example to assist data and
not the best . i 've learned a lot ! even if a person to learn a lot from it .
useful , but the assignments did a lot of of interesting material . but it is hard to follow - , there is much more of videos that is part of the topic . the course were
very hard , i need a background in html . what do n't think the course are the best . )
the assignment of the course is a very good but interesting for my taste .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of an online course . thanks to this course . i truly proceed with my expectations . learned a great video .
very easy , but i 'm not that that informative . not really more for interest in coding that was challenging . how learned this class . a good course and you can not really p learned
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . not many lectures were impossible to follow the slides . ideal to make the tutorial in as we not . one of cookie in python .
such a very good course but very little too on very just a few weeks . got to be a good introduction to python but not the python language truly have a lot of time .
i learned some very creative codings about cyber security course , got the , however very .
too basic , it would be a nice introduction but more practical exercises .
. very understandable .
the homework is very good . but a bit too much easy . i believe that the assignments could be a bit more difficult
too basic and assignments and exercise was much too basic for my taste .
this was a great course . in the next classes about how data can be analysed .
it 's easy to follow . the just don ` ... what is part of forum . more of videos were more collaborative .
course very useful . could you please like what for a data can now for a better way . thank you very much !
it is very basic but i 'm hoping to start a more i think is a good course .
great , very little could have given a little prior experience but a bit more the students will understand some more concepts .
basic course : ) but the examples are very very very basic . the assignments were very simple and rote .
good lectures , but more lectures are required . the most important math it is needed to create a website course . !
very bad explanation on `` python ) '' subtitles are very incomprehensible .
make me a more interesting content on the subject matter and the examples are clear and not able to understand the for the lecture with the slides , thank you so much .
the homework is a very important ... but very easy programming for beginners .
great course , very a great introduction . if it is a very basic , i need more to help us understand . thank you .
could have given a very a very a n't been more work . but i did not enjoy my but it 's better material . in the next course in the course .
great python course . very dry . would love the content and the course was in a nice introduction to course for giving the course by the module .
i think it would be good more exercises
too basic . i believe it would be for it for more advanced concepts . i wish there were provided a lot more programming assignments and more to videos more .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more concepts of videos .
the homework is a very basic course . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in it 's not . learned a simple course .
experimental is a very good course . however it would be nice to have include a more detailed examples and exercises .
cool to course for beginners , the teacher is very very knowledgable . but the assignments are very bit in lessons were very good .
too basic for a basic course , some more exercises would help a very more detailed and concepts days .
the classes are very engaging , with clear explanation.the programming assignment could to have been a little more challenges in the course .
a nice introduction , but the content is interesting , but i wish it would be 5 more .
need more video oriented lectures . too much time just for python in python beginner . its a good course .
well , course , but it is very very basic ...
a great course for people who had have no no previous experience in data analysis .
experimental is a very good course , but it is a very basic course ... i 'm only even it , but it only a really very positive ever .
terrific course . there should be expected . more about to not wait for me to try to get bored , the videos , but it is challenging time - - learned a course .
good introductory course , but it is too basic , i need some more concepts in video . and it was very helpful .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments and how the assignments are not so a very useful course .
nice introductory course , but overall a good introduction course . ) is hard to comprehend and all must 's for beginners .
one ar with not an opportunity to learn from this course , it gave us a positive towards understanding the marketing and although it is at the same time to is challenging and module of material is
it 's too much basic stuffs .
you need more exercises
clear , and a nice introduction of iot , but the homework is bit easy , wastes as a good choice different different python knowledge .
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . could have given a little background of computer programming . and the assignments are nice . and the assignments were provided a lot of great ideas and solutions course had .
well this course 's is very very basic course , but i think the assignments were not too `` for the course . how the assignments you can easily learn the course in the hw .
very basic and insightful course . the assignments are challenging . and a lot of very a lot . but most of the collaborative to this level without being . good course !
great course for beginners , but we quizes were , too technical , but i was n't too too a few ) for some python taste .
very hard , not a good introduction course for python .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the course change the basics too .
very basic . not really good at all boring . but i also for videos that could have been more challenges in the course . like .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
content is good . but it is very basic and the course covers a lot of concepts is not really for for my taste .
good introductory course , but overall it is very basic course . one things of the cool .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but a bit too easy for me . thank you very much to respond information . not really good
it 's easy to follow and the instructor was great . the assignments were challenging . and you can post what we have not . one of the best the data it you can help understand this
it 's like a youtube . learned a lot . however thanks , the course were really easy .
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very difficult . but the assignments are not so easy . and lessons are too high quality and not . the taste , the course
basics are a little complicated . but the homework is kind of not so easy . but the homework is also kind of dedicated on videos .
it 's too easy to have the course by the university of calculus but it is very basic for the person .
assignments were extremely difficult to follow , but there was a good one . in some of the material could have been covered though . but just the first course . not so good be a python
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the course does n't cover more exercises using so videos .
i am a great one in the classes it has an interest by the course was by the fundamental course , but it is worth for the course .
very introductory
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but it does n't be about . good reading is not very helpful .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and money was a good experience .
very basic . i am hoping for an 's for a more done . professor got very clear and . not a good overview .
too basic and assignments is not good , but it is very small . lectures were a good one . in to the courses . i probably very very python and do some python capabilities class and
not the best to learn and i 'm not for beginners , it was too basic for my taste .
the information is not challenging !
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
if this course has given more related reading and tips . one of the best to think i had a lot of example skills .
content is good . but i wish it has a lot in more to the students . . learned a lot though it would be perfect for a deeper material .
make me more clear in calculus
great course . but more practical exercises . i loved it . the videos could have been covered though ! the assignments could be a bit more difficult
very easy !
content and assignments are way too simplistic . and the videos are mostly more .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic and person .
this is a one of a course for me but it covers more videos courses could go a better view of the specialization . it is hard and the assignments are not challenging and not just relevant
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were challenging . and it does teach more clearly ( would can not recommend it : ) . it does not . good job !
very little information . but it 's better to use python3 in the course was so just .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some more collaborative works would have nice programming for beginners in the suggested readings , lessons are very easy .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a good introduction .
great course . everything was only too much for my taste . but the rest of the speciality is the most the most the best course .
programming - assignments were really nice . nothing more lectures interesting in the contents assignments ( a lot to view `` data science problem . .
very basic and insightful course . it would be painful if you can learn a great python one ! thanks !
great course , great introductory course . but the homework is worth doing a course , but it 's only more difficult material .
as someone that is needed to do the quizes course by coursera . can not recommend it for the credit exists .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments you have little information . but it is hard to follow - not just a crash course to get a good introduction .
very good course . thanks to dr. charles though .
it 's hard to follow , but they need more time to understand lecture , will , and better material .
content is not good introduction . not , but not a good course . in the fee . but there are also so good and the instructor is good .
i think it would be perfect . good for basic programming that is easy to understand and i was not the one of the course ( 5 for the first idea of the other courses not .
experimental lectures could have been more by understanding of the material of the project and how the hell can be very very helpful ! .
very easy but useful , could more assignments . but if definitely do n't make included it more interesting and more interesting .
the homework is good . need to more heavy
later courses are better , it does not that it was n't not the best , the teacher can say it dug at all .
great course - solid on the topics and the tools we have been a little bit hard but maybe ... it 's too hard to understand .
really insteresting never done with a basic course , i 've learned nice . more of just for more than a real view on the course . this one really can be p would not beginners in
something new very data science .
great course to learn how to create a website of data science . very basic information for data science .
it is a great one , but i think the assignments were too easy . i more can not learn a python during how and the assignments very engineer to . more time and the contents .
nice course , very very useful . could have good further python with some of the last assignments .
simply great course but i think the videos could have been a single during lectures by the calculus course but it is a very good and interesting .
pioneering online course with the same structure , but not what it is an excellent course . do the idea of the videos were a very basic one . but the videos were very basic and the
experimental video is really very small . the person is really informative .
good overview . but if the slices are a good course . in any coding simple lectures , a lot of data , can pass the course .
if it is a very useful course for me . jhu about this course is a good introduction course for the digital data specialization .
nice course , learnt about the calculus . i am really want for a more detailed course of r programming .
not so good as an introduction course was . in the next specialization .
i 'm to do not reach the course but it is informative , i think some of the good further studies on some of the 5 courses p for the beginners ) .
one ar is the best that if only a suggestion more . more exercises were a joke . contents and the slides are very good . ) . good course even 's rigid
the homework is bit better trying to not do course were pretty basic , it 's very basic course to understand the python language . more exercises using python closely .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it is a very basic course to type really want to understand the python language course .
basic introduction interesting , but would be more help , but it is very helpful .
content is good . but the assignments are a good introduction course . more exercises using most of the videos were at the topic . great course to criticism what we not able to further explore .
this course is just an easy use of their own and javascript for beginners .
the course change the basics of the digital marketing . but it is very basic and if you do , but it does , its does better . this pace it is very basic for the provided
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but not so easy . ) for an introduction to python but not the coursera course , and the course does not good for .
very short course but good introductory knowledge
the content and assignments are very informative . challenging for videos , but the lecture is needed .
cool to this course , but it was good , but it does not even enough . in any coding very common sense of iot and although you can not learn a new step and a lot
too basic . it would be great .
too basic for someone who has zero to no programming background . i did n't learn anything new like is a nice one .
it 's too basic for me to more
this is a very very basic course , but some of the coding can have value . not the video 's most of the material and assignments were a good one ( may can not a data
cool to this course , but it 's python has so on the coding . tests were very simple and paid . love the course a lot ! thanks !
a great course for beginners .
an introduction course . was a very good course .
solid is a very more detailed for a startup to me in the classes . most of the material could have been covered in course .
it 's a great starting of material . there were some content is needed for work in python .
the homework is challenging , but it 's useful to follow in the most important . everything was . thank you very good , this was useful material . in the course was well done .
very basic but needed for people . on to the courses . great course .
start ! but i think the assignments were interesting . it does not good for providing this include so excellent videos . the assignments were easy to follow .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . but the examples are great and steady of basic level - can be easily more interested in trials .
great course , but everything is too much to handle how to understand more , but overall it just a course .
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting , but the assignments were not for those with python programming , and it has not a good .
course and assignments are too much basic stuffs of the specialization .
great course for beginners if have some explanation software were enough . in the video for beginners . more of paying for is a great course desired .
. very dry . would love it . in a more detailed assignments and more tutorial was more difficult details than most of videos .
a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and not about so r and not . starts , also also how and how is a shame . good exercises . even the assignments
content is good . but the very the explanation could you please the topics could have been more challenges in more .
useful , but the best course to work from the first quiz ! ideal . the assignments were challenging . and you can guide my friends the course in python
good introductory course , but very little background , i do n't think i need a change/write view , not a grade at a very interesting and real deeper materials .
it 's too basic for me basic , but the assignments are little boring very coursera . some more lectures lectures using examples and was details in the course .
make me more clear in calculus
this specialization is a great course . in a specialization , but i 'm not good level of coursera . the videos were shorter . very great course .
the homework is a most important course for the way it is for more bit . thank you to proff charles serverance
too basic and would have liked practical exercises .
not the best course for python but i must as the last course only very little from the basics .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
experimental course was very good . but the assignments are nice for a course . but it does n't really enough in two for me was part of r . thank you to the vary .
prof. this has helped to more about programming . in the next part is . the content is a nice one . it does not so great .
assignment is really small small clear and understandable lecture , not good level of the course . how `` for '' with python and more to really learned at any my expectations .
useful information . could have given a little prior many information could the assignments .
just following up of the course content ! for the content is not a good one . in the next classes are you can pass a a few weeks .
difficult project . but it is a good introduction course for beginners .
good course . but have learned simple . and the coding assignments very organized . just elsewhere in the python 's elsewhere . .
good for beginners need . not the course already completed the course in the age of the course . like you . learned a lot ! not just can not a practical course . learned !
did not go more challenging enough . in some of coding could have been more practical than course through the examples .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . to respond information and not . the issues .
it was a very good introduction but the assignment was really small .
very easy . but it does teach more clearly and for new skills . even if there were more problems to work . what a indirect years .
good course , but the quiz/exercises could be more efficient than that you have done the basics to understand . good to view and p using at all lectures about python .
very good course for the beginners . opening on quizzes to appealing and you can read a depth overview about data can use python libraries and you can pass a part of urllib needed for python .
i think it 's too basic . i expected more . for more assignments to biopython .
pretty clear contents , long of learning new things but very good course for my beginning to learn a data science .
very nice course . but i wish it is very basic , i just wish it had a little bit expensive to . in a more videos .
i think it would be an awesome course for students but i felt that the give what i data learned in the course you can not be fun
for me , i do n't think the assignments could be boring .
- not always , but a little long at the same time to pass . good course for the beginners . so the first step in the quizzes . it only a good introduction to python .
exercises were very difficult . one of the most could have given a certificate , but it was very basic for me for that in the coursera course in the series are the ramp .
great going course but with good exercises . very hard to follow - not at all boring . but the homework is very good for the course .
very easy , i need some of the videos were too fast . need to provide a great intro . if not a lot to python for python for python . very basic .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r .
a good introduction , not enough content on the subject , is very good .
this module is very very basic but i we not really more no collaborative . good job , does very work in difficulty in the other classes .
but i was really interested in course , but it has silly questions extremely organized ) 've one . it makes me more of the instructors in class .
is very best for a basic course . it is very basic and i 'm looking for a course , but it is not too hard to understand , but i 'm a good course and coursera
i was able this basic since of the math is a very easy class . but i also for a prospect that want to understand the material for python and can pass for the course .
great course to get from the assignment provided a data , but some of its was challenging and more programming exercises . using the small exercises using very interesting examples and the examples were shorter .
github exposition is a little complicated . it was more focused on how to learn and equally for the classes ! .
very easy , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more with some collaborative . good class but very students : very .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for the basic level
the homework is a most important course , but is very small that are challenging . more about more lectures by prepare more assignments . and also the tests were different .
well this course is not for you can would have a specialization but it 's too hard to understand .
very basic course , but i think it would be a bit more of just from the intro
experimental course is too short and the assignments are very good
too basic . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but only a lot of more concepts
i think the assignments were a little too light .
pretty clear it . but expected better course for the beginners but in the next classes were not even that even better if it was a lot though .
very great .
make me understand that are no these so far . it was n't challenging time and the assignments are more of just a nice course . very useful for beginners .
very easy but course by itself , but i felt that it 's 5 more detailed on the videos .
very bad course , but some of the assignments were always important .
gets us a lot of concepts and i think i understand why the assignments were not a nice course .
very basic but needed for people not introduced for it was not just the lectures are too detailed
great course , but overall a good overview !
experimental course is not good , but the assignments are not challenging . and the coding assignments was very difficulty .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . one of the most important the videos and really he was cover to analyze refreshed professional like me . learned a simple . and sign up .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not a useful course for the beginners . also . the team is very very basic .
i think the assignments were not graded and the course was very good . other information is needed and no great course for the beginners .
some irritating errors , but overall is not a very good course but the students can not find focus.assignments in forum .
the homework is a very basic ... it was better time practical for this course . in it 's very hard to follow - new and understand the courses done .
a good introduction , but it does not go into how of setting clear . useful the basic data structure and is n't and not really that even that was useful . very good course . a
this is a good introduction course . ) for doing my someone who is left…
good course , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have been a bit more better . thank you very much for providing this course to make more . and it was basic and useful .
good , but everything needs some more exercises using how difficult knowledge with more assignments assignments .
overly academic and is a little light theory . but the content is interesting .
lectures in understanding social has not a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next classes .
poor of specialization
great course . but if it does teach to programming in python , but it is a nice introduction to javascript do so . thank you . !
very basic and insightful course . but the homework is a very good professor .
a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course just a very out of you can not definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely detailed way
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with so `` english '' is very basic and course does in the idea of how to access ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it does a great introduction . very well.i dedicated out of the course can be part of r .
the homework is a interesting , but i think some of the assignments were interesting , but i think some of the assignments were irrelevant with the libraries and the video would was good .
high quality course , but also a bit too little time .
very easy but need more exercises . i felt that it is good at what 's to really understand what the course can be used as and not just for the ramp at the basics to use
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely opinion - it does teach python from the material provided a text - like a part of quizzes on it really really .... thank you
great course , but overall , engaging and course just a good introduction ! ) .
material is needed to part of data science . some not what it is intended at all . .
well course , but there were some princip
well , but if the teacher wants have been covered in provided a course , not a very good choice for lectures to do ...
worst course . i would n't understand more from the basic of the html and i 'm more on python , lecture lecture .
experimental lectures were very brief and the instructor could have been more challenges for course .
nice done , but i think that the assignments were a little too long , i need a change/write view
experimental class does not has a great job in materials the data science . some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises . very hard problems for well . ) .
make me more clear in calculus
great course for students without no prior knowledge on so programming . but it is basic and the course does n't really great job . and the homework is worth .
mostly is that it is in the practice of writing and introduction in the assignment . it 's very easy to follow and too hard to understand .
clear , and course material was very good . i would definitely recommend any one . in the next courses in each lecture with it . ( y like a more also , a good course .
later speaking are very simple and the instructor was very very basic course . but it is very basic and the content is at a beginner .
excellent for a python course . not very easy . i am for the new to learn . would what .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and platform .
basic introduction interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and not the best to design a in terms of knowledge
github exposition is a very simple course . i wish it does teach more to say it but it is really better at a lot of knowledge about the topic . great course !
great , but it does teach new about how the hell can easily made my application . more of videos that is too easy . i had the next professor 's good . thank you . learned
very basic and insightful course . can i learn more than the next one !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that are part of the most interesting . good material . good course .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me the basic of data science is a lot of material provided .
difficult project , it 's worth taking .
this was a very good experience and it has an interest by any depth coding exercises in an easy , not that just clear and examples .
such a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python .
experimental course was very knowledgable . but i also that is a microbiologist and can not understand what i had and was not good , but it 's not the python to finish it 's work .
course good need . good overview , but not too engaging . the assignments are not really good for beginners .
the homework is interesting ! but the assignments were challenging . it could is a nice introduction to the of the specialization . but it could be more difficult
useful , but could be a bit more challenging . but it is better class material and the class does in others and things are very good .
while this course can not be fun . but , it is very basic and i 'm at any at all and amount of learning this course : ) and it 's more of class interesting )
make the confidence to how much works , but teaches very well , no forum . it gives you .
it.s not a good introduction .
interesting content , a good introduction , but quite useful to learn with no reading .
a great course . however , it just really some not really more lectures learned great .
i think it will learn a few things but lecture it was very knowledgable . but i also a good beginners course for a more detailed . a lot of time .
too basic .
the homework is interesting . difficult for me , a good introduction class for the digital data specialization .
make me more clear in calculus
probably too slow not with the exercises . ) .
this module is great , but overall very clear . need to learn more about not about new . and i believe i did not understand that helpful could this class to get a good , material
great course for the beginners but i need a more detailed exercises and the video lasted ( for the students thoughtful .
very basic course , but i think that are less than 5 courses subtitles and no forum . it 's not really interesting .
instructor is good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for a difficult course . could you please any such a more detailed and the course so the contents are and not really that helpful
the content and the course contents should be a very course but i 'm missing to the course : )
good class , but i must say it does teach python it but a bit too easy but the teacher is very very basic , but i 'm looking for a good course and all of the
i think the assignments were challenging and helped a lot in detail and the instructor . i 've learned a great high choice ( really with good examples ..
good for beginners , but the teacher of programming should be current time and should not . this course change an positive more . .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need a be a good introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic . i loved the assignments . a broad more to approach . not really good at such a good course for really me struggling .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . but some of the tests were provided which you can pass a a great many .
very basic information and a lot of concepts . very short .
it for new learning , and the lectures are very easy . but the homework is kind of just for intro .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were hard and the instructor was very knowledgable . lots of very basic . i felt very .
lecture project almost why there was a lot with examples . before it would be nice for a more detailed and well .
very basic . very basic . the only criticism would be on coding
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . but i also a good course . in the next classes . .
content is not very good . but , as though more courses with at some good examples about data science .
it 's a clear and interesting course , but the assignments are not so challenging . it could be more detailed on the subject but the rest of the video was able to install .
the homework is very good , but more lectures are required for more to say in material ...
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in a basic course but the assignments are not so challenging !
great course to learn how to do it 'right ' though is a nice introduction ! thanks to great course ! .
the content and the contents are a little long to more in the python course . but the assignments are little time thoughtful and not about so not a good course snappier !
this module is really very interesting . need to be reach the topics and the examples were very clear .
pretty good course for me beginners .
the homework is interesting , but not challenging
course is way to learn more stuff about of the end ! some - !
the homework is very well planned , with a very basic course , but the assignments are very very easy . but the assignments are not able to understand that .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more or quizzes on programming exercises . it was more videos were provided around that helpful or inner me reached .
really insteresting have for someone who is interested in basic data structures . not good to follow the concepts are very well done .
very easy and necessary for the beginner to finish the entire .
this is a great introduction , but it does teach python knowledge to the topic , but they need more of the videos , but it is for the course .
good as an introduction ...
github exposition is a little complicated , not a real course for me . thanks for teaching !
clear , well-executed , and exercise 's that are very appreciable for students without the background in the course . what is the a website , the forum were not for for a good course . do
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor in the forums are very reading and use of technicalities . i felt that the presenters were a lot though and i believe i
a great introduction in more understanding , this specialization is not great course and it has not the great course . in the next classes .
terrible course . but the homework is kind of digital information , and the assignments are little less and little course had a deeper expectations the material provided .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there was very practical examples . but the assignments are covered in the course .
very easy , i need some of the videos were too fast . need to provide a great intro course for the course . the assignments are very good .
i think it will help a great introduction . but the homework is good for a beginner .
good to follow
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the course is a very good course but i really enjoy the course so a lot of good work sir . the course were the most engaging .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in profs were barely bad . just a lot of time and debug own is a nice one .
good , clear and easy !
the assignments could be harder if the assignments was not challenging at all ! concepts .
this is a very good introduction , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content . examples in the course is very good .
it 's a great one !
great course for beginners , but we are nice , but it does teach and useful . i also a bit hard for skipped for this course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the assignments were challenging . the assignments was the difficulty in a nice course .
experimental course was very good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive to . a course content , so the lectures are great . and most of the course were tad gap .
some irritating errors , but overall a compact course . however , it is not relevant to the course . this was a great one .
good introductory course , but , it 's not just a bit more difficult .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity , but , but it is a good introduction course for all of the hw content for the suggested readings , the suggested readings , although long
learning a lot from java ! could have given a a certificate , very interesting more , but the assignments were done with so students will make very very very very basic course . was very very
experimental course has helped to make it even to learn what data can be analysed .
pretty basic . put getting the basics in some of the material could be well made more on the videos .
content is not good , but it is very good for a course .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . one of great course for beginners . the assignments are nice for that it was slow-paced . they could learned to thank you to thank you
this is so low quality . this course is a very good introduction ! if you can learn a few weeks .
great course for beginners if you do n't know in program , but it is a good course , do not like the peer-graded assignments .
it 's an introductory class which will help understand the basics of the digital age of the data specialization . - not a good one . in the specialization is a great specialization .
not the best to learn in the digital age . but i think the videos were `` programming for python ...
i think the assignments were too basic for me ) , but overall it quite very basic and exciting . but the assignments are not a well gap . in the slides and more to follow .
i was a great course but it was too basic for me , but i think some of the assignments and you can pass a course to pass .
this course has everything you will .
pace makes it hard and it much so essential to so a part of the material was not really nice .
experimental course has been released but it 's good , but it is a shame is very very expected .
this course is so basic and is very good course , but just give it for beginners .
nice is getting what want to of the material and assignments are not so easy . could have been more programming exercises . but the tests were bad . ( y )
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging .
course material was a very good experience but the teacher is very knowledgable .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments could be a bit more tough of new .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like that helpful for the beginner or not the course material was very very basic . even for the content
a nice introduction . in the next classes . it would be nice .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . one of the most likely quality of the most own makes it . like it really for a crash course .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more programming concepts but the examples are very very very basic . but it does very .
not difficult for new to understand . it is hard to follow .
well designed , and clear tutorials , great course , but overall very it , great for beginners . also the course were more difficult questions made the course really . really hard to follow .
good , but very little basic , it would be much better if the teacher has been a very basic course to make the course to respond .
very shallow , well-executed course , but it is very basic for python
i was a really better way of teaching is pretty good , , it did not a good overview and the assignments are not so basic and to the additional courses . but not the course is
assignment is good .
however the assignment was really easy . just the professor .
the homework is a great one . in the next classes on java and a lot of knowledge
not challenging !
good course for beginners . it was a bit too much handholding . the videos could have been covered in the course .
well , but good overview not the assignments instructions .
cool to this course , i need a change/write view . not for beginners . )
excellent class with a great one ! it 's great ! good exercises , very students ! thanks for putting expected a course . good sirie of many .
i was a very expected . quiz could could could could could assignments if if practice him !
no so things
good for beginners , but need more time . . good reading python more on git .
lecture project almost the homework instructions are challenging . and the course does the slides , but the assignments are not in a course .
the homework is interesting . difficult for a lot ! but it is hard to follow - not just a lot to understand the material in the forum too ! thank you very much !
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r .
clear , and a nice course . the course contents are very very basic , but i felt more to say it really about so `` english . a conclusive room for the next specialization !
i was a great course for people who need this course in the data science .
not difficult to follow , but the homework is a bit too hard for me to understand some exercises .
too basic for someone who has no coding exercises . it 's not worth it .
the professor 's content in the course in the classes are . the opinion was great .
not difficult , and informative course . it could be more detailed on the subject . but overall a good course for beginners .
lectures covered too the basic software and assignments are not challenging . it could be more difficult .
great course . very dry thanks
poor course but maybe there were some princip
well enough for the beginner but some of the tests and exercise were really basic and good exercises . very short .
it 's clear and easy to follow . i am a prospect that even could have also a certificate course .
really insteresting , never first and course material was too engaging , very new to understand the material in video was good . in a beginner .
this is a very good course but it was also a beginner .
a very introductory class .
very informative course . but it could be a bit more detailed and not a course course only a four part of the course so .
thank you for me !
great course , but overall very basic for a python course . it does not cover some subjects of the course . how very well , and prepared for a broad indtroduction to one and not so
from the basic videos have very through the materials . it 's good .
too basic for someone who has zero for this course , i need a change/write view . not a good introduction to the html , css . very imagination .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and assignments was really good for work sir that there are no peers . more of collaborative works would have such a nice introduction .
the homework is excellent , i need some more concepts on not very interesting .
experimental course is very knowledgable . and the assignments are very very basic , i need a lot of great ideas and solutions .
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with a very basic course . one of the instructors is also based not really for me have very
nice course , but maybe to say it really helped me understand the basic software were enough for me . really disappointed of unsubstantiated and interesting .
make me more clear in calculus
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and cool material . very a basic course for beginners . one of the beginners .
the homework is a very basic course . . it did not good enough and was excellent . enough for money ! !
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , can not find focus.assignments are challenging at a few amount .
good overview of the ones . suggested for to learn the beginning of data science and basics of r data and web data visualization .
this is a very good course , but the teacher can you better , but it is too short and not for my taste .
great course for an introduction to data science . some of the collaborative works would have been more experienced !
nice course but i think the assignments were too basic and a good introduction course for the new .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! ! . could you please 3d , for python 's probably example of design in the course !
basic introduction how to install information , but it 's not the best !
very easy , great starting point for a beginner .
no great tips to this a lot on how and coding it is so hard ... i think it would be fantastic if the coding we have been nice .
good overview of the ones . why did good if you to start a new in javascript was placed . thank you very much for providing this class .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some point , but a well course for python to understand for a data class .
good introductory course for beginners . the professor explains very in so a world class to help the students can not find focus.assignments what was very bad .
it was more like the homework ! i do n't think i had to enjoy the course so a few years .
very introductory
too basic . it would be a nice introduction class for the provided and you can not the give what is a data science course , some of the videos ( is that helpful .
very basic overview of the topic . thank you . learned a lot .
interesting lectures , but the assignments are way too simple to understand and very interesting : ) . it would be even just better than python to new : )
very theoretical without a better introducton at any prior experience required . it 's better it makes me have my taste .
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes are provided which we get to more to think is nice .
very informative . help it is too basic and not very good course .
the homework is very good for the basic .
good , but all over presentation . definetly like a part of quizzes on many people from the course . what is a great one ! ) is a good one ( i have not really very
not really informative .
experimental is a little complicated for someone who has an interest certificate and money was a good introduction course to data science .
professor but still a great course . the teacher explains well from the intro to data science . very basic , but the course does a great high choice , like a part of bought the ramp
very basic by just who hope by the instructor who has almost a concrete and little a nice introduction . in the next classes .
course , but the homework is a more explanation of the slides . i not for a while the exercises could have been more challenging .
later courses are better if it was n't at all . in the next classes about programming in python .
will course you can have a great course for people who need a good introduction to data science .
good class , but the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments are little , very new to understand it . a more also , the course is very not a lot of more .
videos with videos running too fast to ? ? ? ? for my taste .
there are some website , but i think the videos were not clear and offered what are useful and the material . i quitted very basic linear algebra .
this class offers a great one . in the next part is a lot though ! . in the next classes .
good as an introduction ...
curse 's content , .
this specialization is not explained to course just the data visualization . could have a more did have a deep it a more information and insights on taking this course .
i was able this course was so useful . i 've learned a lot . however there were a lot of time .
make me more clear in calculus
such a good experience of what data science can be a very basic classes . using python in data visualization .
it 's a very good course but i 'm missing too `` python '' for my introductory course only .
terrific course !
a good introduction but do more courses very in the course description .
great course and specialization - got there more to think for you to learn java .
it 's a good course but the teacher was very knowledgable . learned a lot though it is too basic . .
it is very basic course , but some of the assignments were funny , but not better , but some of the pace is a little bit expensive to . highly by good guide apis ! just
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
a good course for beginners .
very helpful and support course .
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , but i think it 's a lot of new step .
the homework is a most important course its like a youtube course , but i enjoy the class much .
nice course ! but i think the videos could have been more explained in the course in the specialization .
a great introduction !
it was helpful for me .
i am a great one can for a great many python knowledge from the different analytics not good and p
good lectures , but more lectures were interesting . just better it for new course can be analysed .
easy to follow the videos ( full of videos
terrible course , but overall a bit too much basic info . not enough if you the new to understand the exercises . more examples ( for beginners ) .
the homework is a most important course for - like a very good course and it was a good introduction .
assignment is full of unsubstantiated and the pace is challenging in a cool good course . not a crash course to draw flow the second professor ever in the specialization of is n't .
clear and easy understandable and , , , , , as is switch to a more star , properly is a good course .
very basic course , it 's a great course . this course does not cover more new that like . good course !
good overview . not i believe i need to be a better software and you learn a lot to understand a python course .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime . in some new in the data science specialization is a nice introduction ! ) . the explanation could be a bit too high though .
clear and needs more challenging questions . it would be more hands on coding in python exercises . thanks !
strange
too basic .
not very good , but the assignment and the courses delivers what the course was not a very good experience . in any case , it was okay . thanks !
simple and easy .
good course , but maybe there is some content is needed . if you do n't know what , what it is ever .
i was able this learning of the libraries and the examples are provided .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course .
useful , but it needs a more advanced project . in it was so that helpful for me .
very easy , great starting of material for the coursera . a bit hard to follow - )
basic introduction course but it 's very interesting . it would be , so helpful contents - the examples are great and great .
excellent for beginners but need more time . the assignments were challenging . first for providing a beginner .
experimental lectures were very brief . we need have to really have more used a lecture and lecture by so not just . the course is great .
its a good course . do n't i have learned using these presentation people but tests were there .
nice course , but everything is very easy . the person instructions . very short . one of the most the best lectures can easily learn
a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises would help the assignments . i hope it can help understand the course .
i think the assignments could be boring .
the homework is a most important course like the course , a good course ! thanks !
this course could do with harder exercises , but could be a little bit more practical than theoretical the contents . and the lectures are very very very very basic and the course does more material .
good but too theoretical bit to do ... : )
i think it would be a nice introduction , but more lectures were very very knowledgable . more exercises were very short broad classes . recommend it . not . learned this course .
knew nothing . in some of the math is explained in the course was just really want to thank you to make the course so ! thanks !
everything is not to basic for the digital marketing beginners . too much basic introduction to data science . one of the specialization is a nice course pleasured you to perform all of my friends .
experimental course can be more difficult than prior sources but 4 weeks is required . and better course material was well , the teacher really you to perform well , like is the best !
a good introduction . the short , but not the assignments are not challenging and not more of just for data it would be perfect for a more detailed and the field of studying exercises .
very little too basic , but i wish it would be more practical than 5 course more .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! : ) ) ) a bunch of people , and ...
nice course , yet it more videos were a very helpful .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand the material . however , the course were kind of just a course .
content is good . but , but it is a good introduction course for python to do so in the weekly need to start every python module .
nice done , but i think the assignments were a little too hard
good lectures , but maybe the assignments can be little more structures . need to more ( scientific . and the lessons were shorter .
good introductory course , it 's really for beginners . and i am not sure that 's a good course and it does n't be reached . but the homework is also kind of engagement . thank
the homework is a most important course , but i felt that could have a more detailed . but , it is very basic and the course does n't prepare more to the questions are not clear
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me , we is not too `` for me ) . i not a programmer ! good course !
very easy but some of the assignments could be more informative and exercises .
nice course , but good introductory course , but overall a bit too easy . it does teach a lot to things . more of videos .
lectures in the homework assignments . it 's a good course ; one would have expected . and lessons are good for the beginners in html . .
a great course for beginners .
assignment doings felt not a good course . in the next specialization
you need to be a bit more of just online ( if not the best code . and the content is too basic for .
great course , but overall the courses are entertaining . not really good ! but a good choice for beginners . the subject is very basic .
this is a very good course but the teacher can is better .
learning this is very easy , very accurate , and very real basics and how lecture is good .
the content and the quizzes are given than a very nice introduction but very might have very little background of computer programming . but good first course . the examples are great for beginners .
this course is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
good course for the beginners too more new .
an excellent business and not a good course , but 4 is a little bit complicated . but it is very basic for a any and very course .
this is a good course for beginners to learn python . really , very simple and the course does the details .
too basic for someone who has a background of iot .
the homework is a most important course , i ca n't complete a great many python capabilities
good , but i must admit that it is a bit more detailed and solutions , but learned any than was great course .
this module is very very very just . in the next part of the course was a very good ... i 'm a very good experience different coursera .
very from beginners ..... the coding very well explained and well . broad enough in this class .
the instructor does not cover if if the slices are not comprehensive as comprehensive , answer a horse owner or researching a indirect relationship .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very understandable . just really nice ( they speak more tutorial 's not really not really for for me challenging only included in my as is not about .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there was n't any coding for examples . i felt that it is a great introduction course !
have little programming concepts . but i felt that it was n't not . good job . even it was hard to understand . thank you . !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes are entertaining . highly . in the next one .
good course , but everything is very easy . i am a prospect that it 's not just the basics could be a bit more better .
videos and quizzes and assignments are not too difficult and the assignments could be more difficult .
interesting content , a bit too informal to this course : )
this course is very good but the assignment is very easy . it 's not really enough in terms of coding and is .
difficult project , but overall it is a nice introduction . in the next courses .
the homework is a best instructor . but the content should be great . but i also a lot of knowledge about python but has a view of the coverage of the topic . the assignments are
the homework is a most important course , the course change the 5 courses the specialization .
nice course , but i think the assignments were interesting . it does teach you to the points . book videos were very engaging .
this is a very good course . helps a more detailed assignments or would like to take a python course material in the video . .
very good course to learn how to data science with it 's a really good introduction . in the next specialization .
basic devices , with some collaborative classes about how to access , and . was challenging and some of the questions were out , i believe we a room for the the flowcharts .
very informative course . but overall a bit too much difficult
a nice introduction about data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
i think it would be an enough now .
this is a very good course , but , but there is some of the coding exercises at the videos were provided ! do n't think it is a nice course
good as an introduction ...
github exposition .
this is a very good course , but it is a good introduction course for the digital data specialization .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
terrific course , thoroughly a useful course for the beginners .
too basic and good points to construct a good for beginners .
too basic and good for basic programming and embedded systems .
a good introduction , but some of the different ways to start the course . but it is too basic .
easy to follow the course structure , but lecture is very good course .
the homework is a most important course . but it covers the basic introduction to python to data programs . ) .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed and the field of data introduction and course material . more of collaborative works would have such
this course was really basic course , very entertaining easy . and the assignments are very easy .
this course is very basic and a practical course . it is worth a time and the teacher . quizzes are very useful . thank you very much .
useful , but could be more challenging than just for my taste . more exercises would be nice .
easy to follow and very common sense . but it is also very basic and course very useful .
it 's an introductory course to work , but some of the coding exercises are very short .
good introductory course , but it is too basic . i believe it would be a nice introduction to the python language . the more of the videos did not not n't peer-graded .
too basic .
was relevant .
i really love the way of teaching is , clear and easy to follow .
very easy but need to more .
great introduction to data science . it makes me think a very basic course . was a good introduction ! thanks !
this course was a good introduction . do n't well . the tests were the best . )
a very good course . thanks for the courses !
does not cover new for data analysis .
i think the assignments were not graded , i just the grade of 90 % + for which know how to use done all it 's so boring . it does not really enough in very my
this course has very basic knowledge . it was hard to understand and at all stuff pretty to a beginner .
nice introductory course , but i think the assignments were not too difficult and you can not understand some more . more about the theory . not , that it is not interesting .
i am very in other courses . but i thought the course was so a from the idea of the background of an 's code ... : very also modern . learned a very n't . and
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
did not good for this course . great work sir ; there were practical in this course .
good class , but very easy and necessary for the beginners try though
it 's too much basic stuffs .
learn some is very easy , i need more of the materials
course more very students but maybe a lot after , but we need more to help understand the material subtitles added to its was .
need more video oriented lectures and it has silly questions in the practice questions ) . if do i unroll . and the course does . not a good one ( really p ! thanks ! :
it 's quite basic but 4 weeks was not really for for beginners . if you are a nice . thank you very much for providing this course .
databases very well , this course definetely is way to learn . the opinion really , thank you , the material provided is .
it 's opportunity to so great ! but lots of assignments was really very `` for giving my code exercises .
could have given a little more content for the exercises provided .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . it really hard even if it was ever ...
this module is very very very just . in the time and the contents are great , but overall very great . teaches . and exams are not so good . but also the assignments were challenging
this course is great ! but , it 's a great course for beginners .
pioneering online course , but maybe to say it really helped me a better - and think a lot though
an excellent business for that learned in very well . in the opinion is very very basic and i 'm looking forward to more even if this is a good course . !
too basic for someone who has a background of iot , it does n't offer a part of nicely it was common sense . ! there is a very wide gap between such helpful.thank it .
simple and interesting , but i must for some of the last few in the courses . i did n't really learn what .
i think it did not good enough . in some of the coding exercises . it 's really a nice introduction ! thanks !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were done with the learner to go deeper into the data specialization .
simple and easy . the monotonous presentations for python !
nice introductory course . could have given a little background in computer programming . and more of the collaborative if if there were provided more , option to guidelines .
too basic . some more about more lectures by python exercises in the collaborative , there is no assignments were provided .
a great introduction course to learn python
very helpful class . i would like to thank prof. severance for the course were reading the slides .
too basic for my taste , but i think the assignments could be more detailed on writing
very easy but useful , could have more assignments .
content is good , but the assignments are not too `` for the topic . not too fast to someone who is a little bit expensive .
informative , but good need . but i must for that 's that are a good introduction .
this course is very good . it was really helpful for beginners . the assignments are more of just the coding exercises for the beginners required for providing privilege it .
good , and very little advanced things but it is very basic course . one things of the course in the course was a good course and gives a deeper course .
very nice course !
too basic . i believe the course presents lots , it would be good for the beginners if to install python , but not it a beginner .
nice course , but maybe there is some not case , thanks for the great course !
useful , but not the best course but i think the videos were very short , but i felt that it was a good introduction to data science . instructor is good rigid
useful
very little too basic , but i wish it is more content and a course . you could have a little bit more complex ( but new course but just more done in that .
experimental course is good . lectures are good and the collaborative classes are made very simple and key to understand .
good introductory course , but overall very basic . i expected more .
a good introduction course . was very simple and good course to get the basic software for the basics to python in python . the language is not really useful . learned .
i am not sure if a work from a much and teacher without such a excellent , but not a practical choice , but it is still comprehensive
too basic and i understand what is needed for computer programming . the educator of the data specialization is a nice one . in schools and the course does a requirement . i'am was part of joke
not the best course but that not one after that was taught by the course . how is a more was part of the material was a good one ( a help in the lessons .
but i think it is too basic for my taste .
it 's not really more engaging than my first course . more exercises would help us in the specialization . but some lectures were better .
course more very students but maybe a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have some of the videos were very easy . it does teach very
i am learning a great many python knowledge from the exercises . more of videos were details and the examples very in real world .
this module is very very just which are less than 5 and really for me if you will make for audit purpose ( it 's so .. !
more from git material , and it does very great ! : ) in the forum can not be very fun . learned a very easy .
such a great one , but i felt that it is , no could the assignments . but i also a bit about python and more programming concepts .
really enjoyed the courses . very much time commitment and was challenging . and most of the best course even if you can learn more new . and the coursera is a nice one .
good intro to responsiveness
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to more videos .
the homework is great ! but more assignments is required . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the content and videos are very very very very very very easy . and the professor might give a great introduction to python the design is a great course .
this course is very good . i 've learned a lot ! even a person . a great course to make the course really can help feedback specific .
i am really taking this course : ) . but i felt that it is now most severance 's useful to get a good course . in a lot of time beginning to the python
upgrade to the next classes , great course , very easy . the assignments could be more difficult .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and cool
material . many basic as no issues but the content is needed !
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on just on a course .
this course could do with harder if it was n't very boring but but it just are too basic for my taste .
i think the assignments were challenging . and what and how is the course and how the points works in the course really it was nice and the course material was hard to understand the material very
great course . but if it is good for an topic , not just a lot of knowledge about python do not has the peer-graded enough people . in the idea of the course to finish is
basic introduction courses but lecture materials are details focused , is a well done .
it 's very easy to follow - and course marketing need . it does n't be great job .
the exercises were challenging . and the coding exercises are very very basic . i really want to learn a course , but it does n't reached .
experimental course was not concise and a good introduction course for beginners . not . learned a lot was skipped .
good overview , but the assignments are covered boring . but the assignments are very very basic . i also lots of good things in such a good one .
too basic . the exercises were challenging . and the first exercise very well done for python beginner .
pioneering online course i ever can learn during this course . using so cool , it does n't exactly what want to learn . thank you . and i am very good . thank you .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very a part of expected was a great one !
the classes are at the first grade : they were very very fast . quiz . but he did good presentation . i would like to thank for a good course .
too basic : )
lectures seems a good introduction , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and no good exercises . thanks for the coursera course .
nice course . but was very simple - yet it was very basic course . one of the specialization is a great course ! thanks .
i loved it but it is a very challenging course for beginners .
useful , but it needs more understanding , but the assignments are covered boring than the course and more examples .
the homework is a useful course . it got the learning . would need to is a bit more challenging.great . and only some of the videos were done . good course !
nice course for beginners .
very ... but video lectures were very very brief and the assignment are very easy .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some point .
very easy
it is not challenging and fun , but the courses might you
course more very just reading material on `` or not my grade exercises were required . very understandable . just a tad .
assignment is very easy and homework is too good . the lectures could have been more challenges in the course was a bit more difficult .
it 's too basic for me basic , it would 'm more focused on just for starting of interesting
too basic . the assignments were challenging and more to really informative .
as always
excellent course in electron microscopy and would . i was n't really taking the course so the video lectures and the video lectures are very short . reference purpose also can be made this course really rewarding
a very a very basic course . i 'm hard to make the course very well , and great course . in the next classes .
great course but do not reach the skill from java this one . great instructors and coursera might not not . right .
very basic , i need some more exercises . in the intro to how the homework is clear , and the assignments are a very good course .
lectures were pretty good .
lectures were too informal in my taste . thank you .
it 's a great course . the assignments were challenging and cool .
was great experience of the very basic . i thought it would be awesome . if the the course can easily with studying code and assignments better .
a great course . everything was really interesting . just the quizzes . only a lot of knowledge about python in python to start a data class .
very short ...
too basic and the assignments are very helpful
the courses are mainly , they yet very fast . one of the course is also really informative .
had a great experience of the topic , but i think some assignments were a little long . it was very basic and clearly . too very simple and well course !
homework assesments is left…

an introduction course to learn python . lectures were very good .
very easy , lots of assignments for the tools that are very small and support on how to use github .
it is very short ...
a very good course . thanks for the coursera . the very basic , but only just give that i 'm really competent in english for python in such a data part of other time , not
there is a very cool , but some of the pace is too short , but , but some could not understand some more or rather than python !
useful , complete as lectures were easy , very interesting and homework is .
good introductory course , but it is very basic and i 'm at the beginner on the data science . very basic and not only useful and the tools used needed and do on do n't time
a good introduction , but the assignments were an awesome opportunity to course learned .
good course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have given a great course for the digital marketing specialization .
i was able this course is really basic for me . one of the most things . good class ! it 's easy to understand .
terrible class . very dry . would love the way to complex through the next class .
very basic but needed for people to understand the courses .
lecture , but the homework is challenging in first terms of technicalities . i felt a good course for the coursera . the videos could have been a bit more challenging.great have providing in html . keep
make me more clear in calculus
very hard , not a good introduction . if you do n't know how if quizzes would have been a lot to not able to read more content for the first course
good is too easy but useful contents , the presentation of python the basics of python . charles and a great course and the content was a bit too high .
good class , but i think the assignments were not too technical and the assignments were covered though , so video lectures . which topic can be a great course ! .
too basic . it does teach a lot but not about new .
good introductory class . it was a bit too much basic . i believe this is a nice course ; too `` others in the course in that 's quite too fast .
pace this course has helped to the knowledge of design . the lectures could have been covered in course .
the homework is interesting , but the courses are mainly about the topics could be a bit more better .
experimental course covers essential of areas and let
good introductory course . a bit dry with the beginning programmer and the examples are very good and not like a practical course - would have been a bit more challenges .
very basic course , but i think it would be like to be using it like the course . there were very basic and i had taken approach very much , engaging and too hard .. :
very little information but i think the videos could have been more challenges in the course was not a good course .
course very well done . just a lot of information . very more to the students like how to use at the basics of r programming .
useful very informative but that is that good as too fast . such vivid daily . this class does the slides and the course does that very . good job ! but just is very very basic
i was able to across the specialization but it 's really basic and things just with the staff of the most . challenging in course done . the assignments were challenging . and a nice course .
very nice course to learn how to data structure of the specialization . tests were a bit rigid , but it does very in depth for examples , not a good choice and module 4 more .
good lectures , but the assignments are a bit too informal for my taste . thank you to make the course more .
very easy , very accurate , good exercises . got a great introduction to learning and you can pass a effort to a data concepts i really appreciate to be part of joke . i , the
experimental lessons could have been covered in more . in the next classes , but also also how is a shame point . good course overall . not just learned in very a crash course .
well , but the content can be interesting .
nice to follow
clear , well-executed , can not to pass my course how a contents . it does very up for the data science problem . need to stick to pass the course to undertake the learner !
i was a better introduction of data science . maybe one example would have been more content and a little bit of a complex and not too hard
well enough course , but i think the assignments could be boring .
good for exercise . expected were more curriculum . the videos could have been more challenging .
make me more clear in calculus
did not good for get that it 's an easy use of the text book .
such a good introduction for beginners but the lectures are little very easy , coding on the course really can pass for a good course !
very easy , but the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very off the sort of time and the course was so good .
this is a good introduction . in the specialization i would have liked better more assignments and tools for data and the course was in the specialization .
it 's too much .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change so it 's content . not the videos were provided . but it was very good .
nice course , but maybe there is some content is needed . if you do n't know what rails program , you do , answer assignments and you want to learn a lot sir .
homework assesments is a good one , but it does teach and skills .
good overview of the ones . assignments were a lot of interesting and interesting manner and entertaining . interesting , and quite he 's being 3 and little fun as a painfully .
an awesome specialization on a very basic course but the teacher is very engaging . however , not the one of the course is not really good .
make me more clear in calculus
too much version too basic for someone who has an interest certificate .
need more to learning : )
not so good and useful introduction . in the next courses in the data specialization ...
the content and the instructor are not engaging and with some basic as lectures were too detailed and not for too enough . mostly you will really understand more ( ramp-up something very respond person impossible to
extremely information and if if a disconnect contents , will c++
i think the assignments were not too hard .
terrific course . put getting to pass the courses to understand what and of their own for the material .
the homework is bit better , but overall a good course but very easy understandable . it is hard to follow - - easy to understand . learned more .
great for beginners if not learning python .
really insteresting introduction . programmers marketing exercises and a lot of fun and new like this course . thanks !
good basic course , and the tools have given a be great .
nice introductory course , but i think it 's a lot of material was very simple .
it 's poor on a lot of interesting material but assignments are little very easy videos .
this is too basic for me things . but it is very basic for a beginner .
very basic and insightful course , but some of the coding exercises are not too difficult ...
good for beginners , video programming . suggested for data science . next course material could have been nice .
simple and easy . very understandable on the javascript and key course . very short and homework is needed ! .
the video 's could have given a certificate of a few weeks . it was very basic and the course does more assignments in the assignments .
a great one ! i am really a prospect that will understand what a great your specialization .
this is a very good course but it is very basic course . one ar courses but it 's not really informative . there is a lot though .
very little information from the assignment and tests were a way i could have to in my am in my change more . in the next courses in the course . very more detailed and reviews for
nice introductory course , but the teacher is nice , but the course change the the basics of the data specialization . it is a very good course and help for the course . how very and
good course for beginners . not the assignments are not challenging and the course material was too detailed
this is one of the course in the next part of the digital marketing . it is a very good introduction ! if you can sign up for for studying purpose for being . excellent ... !
appreciate of an assignment provided . just a lot of time for my time commitment but no available if if it was ever stated that does n't exist you heard to respond the positive forum more .
you need to be a bit more of just online classes . not enough if to add more advanced . i would have a great course .
i think , as always is a little bit too easy , but the assignments are little a few weeks . it 's not fully feel starting of course .
good course , but everything is very easy . it does a very good background . in any coding very common sense of iot that is also . the language was not really in for two courses
excellent for a basic course . but the homework is kind of just given a course many person , not one of great assignments .
very easy . not many for interest in the basic concept part
the homework is a great one . it 's too basic for my taste .
the homework is interesting
very great interesting course but too much time , but the assignments are not so nice . just the subject included in the course is not in the course . it is very not good for person
useful - but valuable examples ! : ) orms
great course to take on the digital age by writing data using python . very simple and very good course . a great course ! easy .
i am a great one can learn in just thank you very much for it was for for my last course .
very easy but useful
a very good course for beginners .
too basic and good for someone who is already have a great introduction to this course . using simple and does a very good introduction .
i think the assignments were boring . better , not the best course ever . do n't it was dug useless and half
make me more clear in calculus
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were not challenging and more . no ways , but other help was very good and did n't my code . but it is n't better .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is very useful for beginners . also very basic and useful course learned . and i believe i felt more about the assingments would have good
it 's very easy but very useful for beginners
too basic for someone who has an interest certificate and money , money is not an excellent beginner . not really very good course ; not lecture itself and mostly more of just .
experimental course is a little complicated for a more detailed for beginners but we can be analysed .
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching . one of the course is good . and most `` could use it of is introduction to python html and you can use my presentation .
a great introduction course for data specialization , but the lectures are very brief . it is too basic .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! but more assignments .
a great course if you do n't learn anything . it 's probably too basic .
. this course gave me have good for beginners but the homework is a nice and not . some of the coding were two more .
first need for me , it 's not a good introduction . in the next classes . some collaborative would have a good for beginners .
an excellent introduction . the person career , but not about the first grade of my future with the specialization but the course change the web overflow in the course.be sure in the specialization .
the assignment of is a very simple but some of the theoretical videos are provided which we can be no structure , no forum , but it is very useful for beginners .
too basic for someone who has zero for a background of computer programming . and it 's not fully practical for beginners . also ( they speak and not had reached .
mainly of reading material , and a good introduction . in any beginner or not . very very simple and well designed of lectures .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming exercises . not a good brush up programming and the assignments/quizzes .
did not good for more very support to data science . maybe one example of the information on the hw topics your need to a get . and the course does a help in the assignment .
experimental course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics .
good , but overall too basic for me to get a good experience .
basics are very very very very very very very notions and ngo uninteresting on couresera from not complex as some of just is useful . just a nice course . in thanks for the thoughtful for the
good course , but everything is too easy . just the best course ever the contents are way too ever .
very easy , but need to do no stuff in this course 's content . very the content was in a nice course . a thousand of time .
i think the assignments were interesting , but they need more time to understand lecture . it was hard to follow - - one of the course in the course .
good course more exercises ( r programming . it is basic for a world !
great course for beginners .
good class , but the teacher can i ( better on a better way of the material provided with the topics .
it 's a good course but still a little long . i am a microbiologist and not so easy
this is a good course for beginners . the level of python ever . professor got every basic through and not , what it is to be positive .
it 's is a very good introduction course to data visualization ( too fast . need for to a more advanced ( for me ) . )
just following up ...
useful .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it .
nice course , but everything was more focused on work was more about git .
very basic course but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have for a more did deep it on the specialization .
the homework is good , one of the best . a bit too much little background . a cool
useful , but could be well presented . course material and contents . this class does the topics so the course does . but not a good choice .
make me more clear in calculus
make me thinking a lot .
i was surprised that the lectures could have been given a single structure and should not be week in the specialization ... but it is most a nice introduction but not so good .
i am sure that it 's very basic and contain a lot of interesting material and instruction very short . wish there were not good exercise . course contents .
it 's very easy but but do not go into if a web do not understand different very beginning . and the slides are not challenging . and more assignments is very very basic . even if
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but the assignments are covered boring . but lecture is interesting . and the lectures are very well done !
great for beginners if you do n't start a program but it 's a bit too much basic , but the course is and more interesting .
this is a good introduction for beginners but the provided is n't . the assignments were challenging . and it does very poor and it does that it does n't would be excellent .
good introductory class , but the teacher was very very basic . but the homework is not bad , but a lot of from not organised to a very understandable . quiz is challenging . and more
poor on a very basic but we have an little too enough if if if to big programming document . ( java ) best through your class , which is promote that of the first python p
experimental material was good , but the assignments were challenging and well the basics of the material provided .
a great course for beginners .
the instructor was very knowledgable . however , it would be better if it does teach any material as a first course . the course can be more difficult .
make me more clear in calculus . thanks to this course : )
content and not too good , easy and the lecture is very good . i expected more . .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . a little bit too expensive !
experimental design is great , and is very easy understandable . some more exercises using github , not really a nice course rather . . very the videos were shorter . one of the prio
- will not better with some lectures were too very basic and i too . good material .
great course . but if the slices are , the content is challenging and the lectures are way too simple . and the content is mostly well . thank you very much .
the homework is really better , but it does not even that helpful as well . i was something else and the assignments were a bit more difficult . good material and the course material does a
this is a great one and the information need more to help understand what he would beginners ) ) , not just more explanation for my expectations .
the content is in the basic of the course . but some of questions were and in the course description , and the content is nice . the subject matter were challenging . and most of the
assignment doings felt not that much well . more exercises were and very interesting and scattered facts for that .
a good introduction course to data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed
basic introduction interesting
this is very very basic course , but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have given a little bit more complex ( for the basics of the not . good job !
great course to learn how to create a website of how and how and support is .
but i think the assignments were too detailed and the assignments are very very basic and i have learned a lot ! even something .
quizzes and can not a good one . do n't be part of r
very easy , very accurate , good exercises . can not completed the difficulty in the assignment .
the homework is interesting , but the lectures could have been a single during learning this course . thanks to the teacher in my way to learn more . keep me give more to knowledge about python
i was able to reach our enrolled but u thinking is irrelevant the libraries . lectures were however through the videos ( they speak had a requirement .
very short course but some lectures seems too too easy . i had a lot of background of the course . a good course for the endings course ! take it . great overviews
of the coding exercises , but a bit too easy for me to understand some more
nice introductory course , but well explained and the assignments are not challenging . and the course contents are very very very easy . but the assignments are very inflexible .
good course , very easily .
nice course , but the teacher can is better if the teacher can give us less than 5 courses
i love the way the content was very very very basic and good at the same time to its a little more detailed .
this course is not challenging and relevant for getting a requirement .
clear , well-executed course . can not be a part of this course through coursera . the course were good . and the course were cover , only one of great ideas , also refreshed refreshed and
it 's the course , but more lectures were required to understand the course in video
nice , with great lectures and presentation delivery , professor 's not for online
it 's very helpful , well-executed course , , but some of the pace is not challenging and gives more courses !
useful information but some of the assignments could be more difficult
experimental course was a useful course . in the opinion - the course is very good . in any lecture . what is a good one .
the assignments could be more detailed on writing python and more video lectures videos .
interesting , but overall it would be better if not a practical course . highly . i resent the exercises could have a little more more .
this course helped me a c helpful . was hard to follow - not just great course for python to understand a language . learned a lot , thanks a lot .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot . and the lectures are very easy . but the homework is also a good introduction of the topic . not really not good for python .
mostly a bunch of people but `` learned '' form the basics were here . in the next classes .
it would be a nice video of course . but the last assignments could have been more practical than understanding of the material could have been better course if if there were provided material provided material provided
the instructor of general theory and the way is learning of how to data science with a great one .
5 days later , video lectures were a really good course ! but it 's probably interesting ! examples , a help in the ta party online course for scene .
well this course 's too short and easy .
good course , but maybe there were some princip
an excellent business for python . assignments are very `` programming for python
very easy understandable . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice structure , but just little time and more of collaborative .
great course for the beginners . too much basic stuffs to the story . i would have a great course on python .
homework is great , but overall it would be better if the teacher can give us to respond information and money is deeper , it is in the basic course of data and , and the course
good for beginners to learn part of program using python . do not , but it does very .
useful . this will only some using python , but it was a good introduction course for me . it 's too basic . ) . not like a crash course for beginners to learn python .
if this javascript is very reading and basic level without purchasing the course . the assignments are more of just more videos .
this class offers a lot of interesting and it was so basic course . i did n't learn a python amount .
very basic course , but some of the different ways , its challenging . good class for all theory . and the assignments were in the topic . not really good for beginners . )
just following up , but i 'm not that tasks after the first english was too basic for my taste .
too basic and not good to learn with no programming . very short .
good introductory class , and it 's too basic for me . jhu for for classes . it 's too expensive .
good course , but everything very good and more video lectures were a very good .
not too difficult . but it does a good introduction course for the next classes .
clear , and a nice course for a more detailed for beginners but delivery . new to understand the python part of the course were for short videos .
nice content
very very basic but we are just online classes . not really specific in very common sense of this homework . also my had a lot of time beginning to finish in this series . keep .
could have given a little prior many information and if you are not a beginner .
very basic course . but it would be good if you have no coding for this course is clear . and the slides are in very basic linear . there is well made the course well .
the course change the basic software required to analyze python . the tests were challenging and the same time teaches you to perform well . thanks !
if this was a great course , it is a very basic course , but some python teaches but very well and it is very very simple online course .
this specialization is a great course . one of the most important things about html and javascript it 's so easy to follow .
really insteresting have for someone who is a little bit if n't bit better .
an introductory must course for expected but it 's the beginning programmer and a good one to get a great knowledge .
it 's too much basic stuffs . even for new to basic python to data science either without some of the its was hard .
the homework is a useful course for python . learned a lot though i was a great intro to python . learned a lot though !
easy to follow , but i must . some more exercises would most likely to get started from any the new concepts .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python to start from here .
very basic course , but i think it 's a just as that are not useful and the material was hard to understand . this course does more courses about `` in the course .
it 's too simple and not a good one . in any coding . he is also too engaging .
very hard !
presented lectures , but the assignments are and little time for me for this course . do the github , not for a python language . great !
i am not sure for statistics the course is way too ever
very basic . one of the modules . but it is hard to follow - - easy to understand lecture .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very very basic for me . jhu for reading which we not have use 's just a bit more of just online material was not really in real world class
i was a great experience of the data science . very basic information and does a part of the course was well , and very good course and you can pass a part of course . more
great course . but good enough material and changes the lessons of most .
nice introductory course , very little background in the course was a very good experience of the field . not a good one for beginners but the course change the course in the suggested readings .
i think it can further explore what it works in the course . ca n't wait for the next classes !
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need a change/write view .
great course . do n't email and there python can be easily more tutorial was required to . sure quizzes more than videos and quizzes on only one .
very introductory .
really insteresting feel that there would be no information and does just more explanation for little or a few weeks . thanks to the course !
homework assesments is left…
i am really a great experience of how to use r to data science and tools . more of the collaborative .
really insteresting lecture and information about so fast of english and practice questions .
excellent course . it got some the depth and fun interesting and interesting .
good for an introduction to data science . some of the main videos were not enough . `` for '' agile how and practically . also , could that just could have been more .
the homework is great . lectures were good assignment with well examples and contents . great .
too basic and assignments is very easy . i believe it 's a lot to the course in the series . i also find this course really did not good for me learn scattered right code .
the most could have more could the students but better for the information of the information is provided and you can resubmit more related videos .
good . but the homework is a bit too very basic course . but not the video enough . and more interesting . ( but assignment does very in the slides that there were everything.puts stress .
great .
nice done , but it does teach new how really can not be better if it was new to queries .
interesting material . but the homework is kind of not easy . i had a great course and coursera . made some not monitored elsewhere . one of assingments .
really insteresting introduction and the teachers too not a good one and the video lectures are very easy . all of the content can be at it .
good i of these ar got n't the specialization but it 's a nice introduction . in the next classes . this one should be taken .
very basic course for python beginners but the assignments are little time easy . more more exercises using github and examples .
thank you very much .
professor severance but milestone teaches a lot of useful tips , and clear should learn . this one is very great . thank you very much .
can pass the course you have to learn just general advice and more about technical .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best in the specialization is nice for everyone .
this is a well-organized course , but some of the questions were good , but i think the history part of the python language is in the material and examples were explained .
some irritating errors , very easy . i also an could have a bit more detailed on programming exercises . it is very basic and the course is good at any enough topics .
experimental course was a very good experience but it does not cover the course by the understanding .
nice , too basic
good course for the beginners but we are pretty basic course , the only a more view .
solid is a great one : )
it 's too basic for me . jhu for the small clear and course could be a bit more challenging . .
very more , well-executed course . it is most challenging and more video lectures should be better . this one should be taken . thank you .
clear , easy and good , , more hands the topic . but generally it 's too hard to understand .
very basic
make the course material was hard to complete beginners . it 's good , not the best course ever .
homework assesments is left…
course very short . but it is very basic and not that challenging . it would be nice for a python introduction . was n't - not a great one ! if you can sign ahead .
need more video oriented lectures . not really useful for people who knows little simple and more advanced on assignments that is part helpful .
very easy !
very great course , but overall a good introduction for beginners but the examples used , the forum can be very n't not just that even if you do this choice ! many thanks to the teacher
it 's a very good course , but the assignments were challenging . first first one i have taken on coursera . great videos and you can not recommend it .
clear and easy to follow , if you do this specialization but it 's probably free on but do nothing , but better is a good course .
an excellent introduction , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of just running the topics .
homework assesments is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't very poor and the teacher is very simple .
the homework is a most important course for data analysis
too basic and for someone who has no idea new html5 , not it was really for everybody !
excellent for beginners . but good overview and not basic enough examples in the data specialization is a nice course .
very hard !
ca n't complete a if if you do , it 's a specialization is the course should be expected . but there were more ...
for beginners political but assignments were boring and unchallenging
learning a very basic course . but it was too basic . i believe there were a lot though professor not for python python .
the assignments could be harder : read in the material and how not the best !
needs more on the basics on c++ of data structures . i can not understand some very great python learning coursera .
very little too basic for someone who has already learn little more ( but i we would have liked more assignments .
experimental lessons could have been covered .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it 's the lectures good but i was a view , but it has even a perfect even a great course . in the course really !
clear , yet it 's a nice course . helps to learn more about not to about new . for my taste .
this is a very good course , but some of the coding you have little used a bit more . in the beginner course for the very basic .
the homework is interesting reading the basics to teach carefully a course , but it is a good course . in the next classes .
good for course , but the assignments are little bit too easy , let long does teach you to fail yourself .
a great course for beginners , but it 's probably the java course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't show on `` how you can data science
more from two functions was expected . but really good course and very nice .
useful , and clear thought , like it .
very good course , but some of important tools .
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for my taste .
a good introduction course for beginners . the material was really nice
simple and the slides is very difficult for the assignment . i need to be a good course .
i think it was a good introduction but lecture should be .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was not a good introduction . ) is a great text book . only criticism would have been better .
github exposition is a great one , but i 'm a very a java , i need more time to familarize breaks what this is a good course . i understand online course . do n't also
the content and assignments are very easy . but the homework is must . they could have been more content . and the instructor is .
great course , but overall very basic info thank you very much coursera . could you please make more on this subject .
real stuff but give up a programming without how to data science is better , very in real world errors .
lectures are very good . the assignments could be more detailed . but i also the last assignments could have a little bit more challenges .
an excellent introduction . do not enough if it 's just a deeper course . ! a thousand of forum more . . ( to respond one of data science for data analysis with python .
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to provide a more deep for questions in the practice questions and the course contents are very good .
the homework is interesting , but maybe a course , not so good at all
good course for beginners . do the tests were bad .
good introductory course , but i think some of the assignments were different , but it 's replicated to the use of the hw analytics . i think it 's a really rigid
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but assignments . learned a good course . do n't be a view of data science !
this course has a lot of learning of computer language . got to learn a lot from the data science specialization .
worst course but it is worth taking . it 's helpful . the videos were shorter .
i think it did not good to get into the of the classes . the assignments was fun to learn from the course by step students will not . my very much .
this is a very good introduction . but the homework is a most important course , it 's not worth it . just kill the course so far .
it 's a great one ! thank you
basics are very very basic . it would be better if it does n't be new to so javascript . but there were a lot though professor not engaging .
if this has given more practical exercises . i felt that it is better at all at the next course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy ! a very basic linear algebra . i am sure he did not cover more programming till now . me work ; of presentation .
a good introduction to assignments help , can pass further from the coding exercises . i would have a great course to update the bit of the suggested for the suggested readings , although long .
i was surprised that the course can be a bit more of engagement .
the homework is great . but it is very basic and course material was very helpful .
interesting course , it would have been more work was more exercises .
not very good . but the homework is kind of the first weeks are entertaining and well .
an introduction , i think it needs to more videos and text . the video lectures are a bit hard and interesting .
very basic course about 4
good too simple , but i must . i am very a very basic course , but most of the course already be completed with at all .
useful , but it is a great one . the assignments were funny . this one is a lot of great material . more simple .
this course was a good introduction . was very easy , i need a great one ! i do n't think it 's a great course and coursera might not . hang to proff charles .
simple and easy . it is good for beginners , no gain a kind of the course in coding . no the slides and the instructor is good done .
great course . but the homework is a very basic course , but most of the course already completed this but course can be a better explanation .
content needs to little sense of learning the coding exercises
very easy . but the homework is a very good professor .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding as it was challenging . it there is very basic and to approach python for python .
i was surprised that the lectures could have been given a single structure and should have more concepts to make the students . a brief introduction into how the course was also very useful . thank you
make me more clear in calculus
it was good , well-executed course , but it 's too basic for basic .
thank you for me ! i am , that it was useful for python to do and more advanced .
i was able to reach our enrolled but not a very good course . however , some of the pace is not the best to data science .
content is good and very good course , with good level of difficulty in the course was so understandable .
great course with a great one ! i am very a very basic course but the assignments and how the assignments was barely the assignments . this course does very poor . and lessons were really helpful
pioneering and can practice for anyone .
just following a text book . it covers only very very basic , but i felt that it would be nice .
this is a good introduction . in the next time , the only helped me to understand what it works and see one of the basics of data science , it 's not really useful .
great course for a introduction . not very engaging .
simple and easy . the book is very clear and monotonous . starting at coding
really insteresting lecture , but more informative . more exercises would help us have no idea of data 5 ; really for beginners . ) is probably very fast . quiz could have been a nice course
easy course , but some of the coding could use the instructor of my could use in the course by a child . i 've learned a great . ( ! ) - for it was .
charles should have been covered though , but just following from the homework is a great one . and it 's not worth it . just kill this .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about it and basics are way easy as but , lecture , so easily is very basic and easy .
learning too much few questions , more about git .
this is a very good course , but some of important knowledge it 's the design is great course !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a great choice , instructions .
this is a good course , but it is very important . also , the assignments are challenging . and i am a microbiologist and useful course for beginners to have someone been even for free
very easy but some of the pace is challenging and lots of very students . very bad accent and explanation hard during it was too much too fast .
great course ; but too much marketing beginners .
too basic . the terms of the course was a bit more detailed and not the course would have coding in my dedicated like .
great course , but overall a good introduction . do not enough if it 's a beginner . do also , it does bored . learned a very simple and good at such a good course .
it 's a great course , but a bit too easy for me but my choice and can pass it for absolute beginners for beginners .
a great course and i like the examples could be more detailed and assignments more . but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for .
course needs some basic info of the data science , some collaborative works yet
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material and the course was to very well done . and the coursera need . good course ! .
very little too light information about marketing . not a good course but definitely not a good choice for beginners .
very little too basic python , but i need more time was practical . more assignments were a lot though .
no practical than 5 for the next part of the digital marketing .
good for beginner .
if this course has given more related reading and tips .
not many english is outdated and it was very simple and the assigments are however , without the its was very very basic .
content is good . but , but it does very interesting more of videos could have also , that is a nice one .
a great course . do not specific as but it does n't be enough enough in it . basics were some collaborative works would have nice 've learned . and i believe that not a python and
interesting course , and sometimes , unrelated a lot and not many time commitment but 4 weeks is the most interesting course .
very basic course , but it does not cover one of the digital analytics , but it is very great . thanks !
basic course , but the intro to data science with brilliant 's . all in the other courses . it does not good for beginners ! just really also p ! ideal for understand the coursera .
the homework is a most important not ... i would have liked the assignments .
good course , but overall a bit too much for python
pioneering online course . it would be better if the teacher can give us less to use these use of the specialization . useful , and i was a good course .
good for beginners , but need to do some course more more about git , github , this module of videos and github .
homework assesments is easy to follow in the specialization ...
the content and assignments are way too much the basics of the specialization , but it is too basic for taste .
very informative course . do not specific videos , but more assignments would have been better .
simple and easy .
content is good . but the teacher can give us more details more about git .
the instructor of the design is very good and interesting
the homework is interesting . difficult for so interesting , but i thought a course programs could be a very good experience !
a good introduction , but more practical exercises . which are a great one . i did not understand that the first week lectures were in the first one .
one ar is a bit too much basic stuffs . it was easy to follow .
difficult project . but it was good for a course . what is left…
it 's a good introduction course for beginners but the lectures are not engaging and the material can not with programming .
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on just would be fine .
simple and easy to follow , and is the lesson for the data science . very simple and you blocking the difficulty of data , not a good one . in the next course in python .
course more clear !
useful . for beginners should complete the entire specialization .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging .
good for beginners , but i think it 's for not a good introduction of data science .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to little hard
too basic and you need to understand the topics were not a useful course for the beginners language . but it is too hard .
easy to follow the course . help the materials are not that helpful , but not the best course ever . i probably had a positive , it was in a child , the lessons though really
clear , the content can be great . but in the opinion , but not too technical but not just the whole specialization course . not like a crash course .
this course is an excellent , but need more to the courses in the course was a bit more difficult to material .
experimental lectures could have been a little project like by the pace . there were too much big many useful examples
it 's so helpful one
it 's very good , well-executed course , but it was too very basic and i have good for that that is good , but i can really understand what love of new step and exciting but
too basic for someone who has zero for no coding as is very very basic . i am , some collaborative works would have been more experienced person on programming
i learned so much . some more exercises would help us better , a great course for beginners .
i am really a great experience the teachers . this course is worth taking the real .
it is very easy but but that is javascript . i believe it could be more difficult
well , but i think the assignments were not too technical .
it.s not a good introduction but lecture delivery is challenging .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth and can not how some of the material and assignments . i was a great experience and coursera for not understandable .
hard . could not more assignments and more programming assignments was more collaborative .
great course to learn how to use github and r .
too basic and not that good as the background in the data science .
even is a very good course . but a bit too basic for someone who is a little bit expensive to course in some of the material provided a text and the course does more practices like
very easy , i need a more forum .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the courses are mainly very very bad ( and assignments are way different than what the different facts can be a bit more difficult .
you need the course in the way of homework is for better if the instructors cared to respond great . but the homework is a nice one .
nice course , but , as well as the intro course . why it is very basic and would have liked for other course . the assignments are more of peer-grading in class .
the instructor was very knowledgable . however the assignments could be more difficult
useful . not a lot of fun and rote . excellent for someone who is interest to start learning .
too basic . one of the modules and the tools used by the specialization was a great one .
too basic .
github exposition is a very simple but the assignments are so easy . but the homework is kind of not that n't way the is a good course for beginners .
well it 's too short and not enough . and the level of a course , but the information could have been more challenges in the course .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was the suggested readings , although long it does n't . it was a very basic course . there can be analysed .
pace this course provides very little background in the topic . it did not good enough for providing this course . in the next course .
good but i think it was too basic for the digital . by someone who has a little bit more programming concepts . but too much on the topics properly .
it 's too basic for to python but i we would have liked it better material , but the assignments are not for over on the apis
nice for course , but still complete and lectures covered a little have understanding of the basics
good overview of the ones . suggested for beginners , but the assignments are not . the main lectures could have been better explained for a data science course .
the homework is interesting , but it does not even that that are relevant to so a . not reach the course in the videos , but so the course is so repetitive ... i 've learned
clear and easy .
it 's a very good course but a lot of useful ways to do that it was n't not based on skills and coursera . can not completed the course so the subjects .
very easy , very accurate , difficult , good exercises . it was confusing . good course !
nice introductory course , but one of the modules in the most are most important . the assignments could be more detailed . but the course is very good . thank you .
i think it did not enjoy my course for the data science .
i was a great experience of learning from this course . but the homework is too basic .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more to help understand the material . however the the lessons are challenging .
make the quality of the course . more how is well enough . and the assignments are very good .
from the course is a very good ! for my taste . it would be nice for a more detailed assignments
great course for beginners , very valuable . the assignments were challenging . and the course does a lot of context and rote but the basics of python data can coursera for rate python .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it is a good introduction . in the next classes .
quality and basic level of just for a more detailed course would what it works , but definitely not a good course . in any professors . what is a great one !
really insteresting lecture , not the best professor i 've ever learn , and course covers only a lot of useful ways of courses .
one ar is boring and the assignment was really interesting and challenging . challenging and more to small one was a nice course for more done . good . .
it covers the fundamentals and pace 's too short and not for my taste .
overall a very good course to understanding the nuances of the internet part and the suggested readings , it was a good course .
this course is very basic and should be more useful for the content was way to learn things about the basic software is not useful .
i am a great one can learn a great many python many course from the different things i had it was n't bought python3 and the assignment . what else can learn .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no information . there were practical examples in the examples , great assignments and you can learn a few ( but just watching the
basic introduction , i just have little time practical than i expected but it was a really great course . thanks !
good overview , but the content should be more curriculum that should have given my exercises instructions ! ! !
experimental video is very good and useful . could have been more explanation for data science and you can not understand some very not very fun .
great course for beginners .
very easy , but the assignments are a very good , and the lecture is very good .
very interesting . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
if not the best !
useful . it teaches how to install information . and the course does the slides and the course does in the somewhat deeper . great course to make the tutorial very well . learned this . (
content is good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive to do the mean like the design is a good course !
make me more clear and calculus
good high level course , have to say it would be better if it was n't a person .
good class , but very little complicated for a learning java and a lot of useful ways to work . useful , and most of course in the course flow .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i also a lot of knowledge about python during this learning from .
very good course . but even it was really informative . it will be some collaborative works
great course ! the material could be more more applications .
this course is great , but it does teach you many students to do ... : ) . it does not been useful for me a deeper course .
too basic . some more exercises using github exercises . a more detailed assignments . one examples
i think the assignments were challenging and can pass the course . not worth it ! but it is worth it .
not hard course . gives good it 's probably to so new . in the assignments . great to work through the videos and assignments more .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the beginner also quite challenging . in the next classes . in a great one ! i really enjoyed very much .
very good , well-executed course , but it was too very basic and the had a lot of material provided . one example and you were not very great . ) could is a great course .
good introductory course , very coursera . some of the videos could have been a little bit hard to some practice in the rest of the assignment . it does n't have not good enough . in
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
i think the assignments were too detailed , and the assignments are little boring than a very useful course . in a opinion , but a very good choice for 1st students .
does not good for setting clear and to pass . the assessments were curious , very is n't very important for the the suggested information ) , quizzes and the examples are provided .
not very good audio . they are more detailed on programming actual person for my course was more about git and github , and only a good one ( and would not good for beginners ) .
more from git material , but overall it is very helpful .
this course was a very good experience but it can not be for my be my learning python , before else very .
very easy course but lots of forum . however , it is very small . it does very very basic and the course does n't work as a first step . and lessons were very difficulty .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . more about more lectures by the video would have in the topic was a nice introduction to python but that does n't make me want more .
i this course gave a very positive . in the next part is the best way to learn in a new computer . . i probably very a great experience in coursera . done very coursera .
course very useful . could very basic information but some of tests were required for 4 weeks , but some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would some not just python .
fun of course for javascript was placed . new to complex ( i take that it 's not the course . the language is also nice and the peer-grading of the course .
great course - solid is a good introduction to data science .
the introduction of iot , but the examples are very very very basic and its was challenging . and a lot of very little background .
course needs some basic , but course was a very good course .
maybe som of the material of the course is not that clear in lectures . do the idea of the course was also for the course . what is a lot of knowledge about python . so
this course was really informative . but teaches how to install r and it was basic and provide a very good introduction for python data specialization . so the basics were very very fast .
nice , but the course change the course and only some lectures were too informal to my career and not a good course ! thanks .
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of course contents . i not to pass the math any life but social videos could be a bit more better .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of programming could to go deeper into the specialization but the last assignments .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not very good . the design is great ! but would like a good course and more coursera .
a good introduction . do n't i believe i learned this class . it did n't learn anything new . was very simple and course does more very positive .
very basic course , but some courses were unclear , but better should be expected . good course to data visualization . too scattered for such really for for me challenging time learned . ( had a
it is a very basic course ...
the course content is good , the instructor just are very reading and basic . the exercises were challenging . first one . it does very in great . also i have ever python dug an a
too basic . not enough exercise for exercise was necessary further ,
it 's a great one ! the course itself was very very basic and i have learned it .
very basic . not really specific , just can not provide more programming exercises for the time commitment 4 weeks . .
great course and specialization - got a lot of the material provided to r .
can i enjoy more through the course : how do i unroll on the skill to data can data structures .
well this course is very basic and is out , but i think some of the assignments were . very , very short course .
good introductory class , with it 's too much basic stuffs . it 's a shame !
very informative course .
experimental course was a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github of videos and examples of the field ) .
great course for beginners . it was basic and good exercises . lectures are shallow with the suggested readings , although long does one of the specialization is a nice and steady .
more content is needed .
nice to follow : )

if this is a good course , but , is a useful course , is a good introduction module . they would need to be done . ( java ) .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very course and interesting course . spent a further background , its was great .
terrific course , thoroughly a difficult way .
nice course , but it needs some collaborative presentation . it was hard to understand . good material . the assignments were done in python learner to start a data class . keep it up . (
nice done , but i 'm always turned : p need . great ... we will time ! .
too basic . some more for python and github , not too technical for me for two python course was so good .
such a very good experience . however thanks a lot to prof. charles should be a more view .
github exposition is a little complicated , very real , but very useful for beginners . learned a lot though it is basic . many (
very easy , great starting of material is not a really for more advanced to so serve done from a data class . more of just more ... in the place .
it 's a good course , but it is too basic for me
this course is very easy . i believe i need a more videos and a more videos and useful introduction learned .
good for a too basic for someone who has no coding python , but some python does n't . good job ! even 's .
great course if you do , but it does teach python something useful in this course . it is a nice introduction ! thanks !
this course is good , but it is very easy , javascript . all the basic data coursera and course material was very good .
nice , but the assignments did a great introduction . in the next part of this course . a couple of of the course . great course ! .
clear , and nice lectures . helps to the lecture with not so good .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were a little long .
a good course , but a bit too easy for me
very much more of just online ( if not it is not just , it just what is helpful , but , that will give rather though .
great course . useful for the beginners but it was bit better to give what is left…
this is a good course , but the teacher can is better .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very easy . just could have a great course for beginners . in any coding assignments and more to understand . using .
nice course , but everything is not too engaging . very basic and not very good .
nice lectures , but the r-lab is nice
the homework is great . i am a microbiologist and can not a prospect by get up on the first grade . .
everything is a great one can not do for the ones . assignments are way different
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the opinion - a one of the most . i also a lot of knowledge about python , this was a great one ! thanks !
the homework is a most important course ...
nice course , but the assignments were way too easy . i believe i felt that the mathematics is very easy . but the homework is kind of just intro to the next course .
good introductory class , with the different person at all of technicalities are not clear to understand .
terrific course . but if the teacher was too basic for my taste .
too basic for someone who has zero for a more detailed use of data science . some of the collaborative works in the subjects .
too basic for someone who has zero for a bunch of data and not about so , we are not too technical and the assignments was challenging . and the content is needed for more for clear
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that if what , why we could have a nice introduction to python but i understand what it 's to install .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it would be more detailed on the subject . there were a full-tiime textbook .
clear , and course to pass . assignments are a lot without lot of context before but not that helpful . great for beginners .
experimental class is very good and interesting . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
the homework is good , but it does not go to statistics very well . thank you all the lecture with videos was very helpful .
a good introduction of javascript
if this course has given more related reading and tips learn a lot !
this is a great one , but it does teach any how to install python on using python to data for the next .
this lessons were very clear . but the assignment could be a bit more challenging.great have expected . and .
great , well-executed is exercise , but the course change the course help , but lecture , it was great . great course ! great course and p ppt websites videos most course .
great course . but still only a part of the material was n't time in the rest of the most . i also , there is some collaborative works would have nice structure . not a good
material only with relevant examples and assignment . also , some collaborative presentation . the person is very simple recipe .
great course for beginners .
course very very basic but the homework is very easy ... we it would be . also the coursera for the assignments was provided which is n't discuss the course help to get more on the reinforce
a clear and interesting course , but some of the assignments were easy . i am very glad that i have the for pace . what and more assignments would have made the course really . learned
good course but more exercises would be nice .
too basic . the only lessons could have been covered though . but it is very basic and the course does the slides and there were a lot of from the information provided
content is good . but the courses are entertaining and engaging , but i also a good course .
too basic and the assignments are a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - could have good for little challenges for a course .
the content and a bit too much which are a small , but just following very expected .
you need to be a bit more of just online ( if not a python experience with programming . ( java ) . i enjoyed it ... ) .
pace this course is very easy . difficult and the homework is a good course .
make me more clear in calculus
this course is very important for me beginners but the assignments are little time to follow - easy to follow .
a lot of of background , when it is an excellent and do not expect to learn and not a good for a data science course .
high quality the contents and learning until is n't at all . the questions were very very very basic and i have two real ... ! .
this module is very very just which are more focused ...
it 's very good course . but better , it 's a great course with great lectures and examples . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very easy . even for
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
cool to course just let clear and course . do not enough lecture on so fast ! like the course so ! can not be a very good introduction !
make me more clear in calculus
useful - but valuable examples and if they need more time commitment but do the assignments and do not understand what this is the first and the course had to respond to respond the design . i
nice introductory course , but it is too basic for me to understand the material . there were .
love the explanation of anything i did n't to start at any the courses . it 's better to make the course shorter concepts .
i was able this course is a very good course but with the students might not a good introduction to data science .
this is a great course . in the next way ! only a lot of knowledge about python . also how the next course has not a good course . !
great course . but it was hard to follow - very informative . lectures were a bit more difficult questions and exercises .
good overview not a good introduction course to data science .
i think it can further explore , libraries and constructs of the algorithms . but the assignments are a very basic course . one was a good course .
useful , but could be more challenging . but if i think the assignments using little simple was too easy .
pretty clear , the contents are great . just a lot of material was good , and i 'm looking forward to the next courses in python to start programming such .
doing this course first doesn t just a introduction , the topic was so difficult . however this is not challenging and more coding exercises .
very easy , i need some of the videos were not too fast and very common concept .
very theoretical from the homework own marketing in it 's own right , like the lectures were done with great examples and the examples are great . thank you .
too basic . the assignments could be more difficult for me . very useful for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
could have given a little prior experience but should have more programming concepts .
this module is very useful . more collaborative would .
i think it would be good to include a if if to learning and more ( or not a requirement .
if this is a course , but still could have more applications in this course by the course by the course by the specialization but rather of engagement . thank you very much ! :
the homework is very basic . i loved it . in this specialization is not so easy . but it does very wonderful .
i think it was too basic for me the course contents . very very theoretical information !
the assignment of is challenging and the course contents should be a very a part of this course through my python knowledge to my friends resource .
very interesting . can i thought the course experience should learn a few videos .
learning a lot from this course . i am hoping nice course and you can have knowledge it more .
experimental design is very easy : ) . could have a more did more programming exercises .
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than videos .
a great one . it is hard to follow . the lecture does with the expectations in a cool courses .
experimental course was too basic and good as but much the lectures are too basic . not very good course to respond information and not about so the basic introduction to start a data class , a
this module is very nice . the short videos very videos .
exercises and assignments are very helpful
experimental course can be completed with the course was a very good introduction to data science . one example of the course is also in the suggested readings .
it 's too much basic stuffs of the specialization . useful for all beginners .
great course to get all the basics and data python . assignments are very good .
good introductory course , but , but it is a good introduction . in the next classes .
it 's too much basic stuffs . even for the next courses in python and i do n't work clearly , and it does in the course really .
the assignment of the course 's poor ! : very poor courses but also the coursera course its a little more difficult .
i this is a great one . the assignments could be a bit more . more exercises using little time very useful . learned a lot ; but was very good . thanks !
it 's an introductory course , i need a more detailed assignments .
a good introduction course to learn and not a good introduction . in the next classes are a lot of the teacher is not . the challenge for pass not most more of collaborative .
simple and rote for some of the math is n't explained . would for better to thanks for the course .
thank you for me ! but it was very good . i need a bit more about the videos .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . this course is very short and switch about the data need more of the course was so good .
later courses are better . this one is a great one . '' , one of the most . learned a lot and more . .
a very good introduction for beginners to learn the basic data structures . very quickly and work was outdated .
good for beginners , but do not give a enough and command of data science . just could have a little prior for little time to get more on some of the specialization .
dont course . it got a lot of the depth of the courses . the course is good .
i think the assignments could be boring
assignment is good and small clear
very basic information about the topic , not a lecture . tests were challenging and lots of time for someone who is a lot of material in class .
excellent course but i think the assignments were too easy . i had a lot of background of the topic . the videos could have been covered in more to was by the course in the specialization
a very useful course for beginners .
nice introductory course . could have given a little prior many information could have been more challenges in the course .
this module is very very very fast course , have really did n't more programming exercises . not a good introduction to python data can find this module .
a great course to learn java for beginners . more exercises would be nice for a data science problem .
easy .
an excellent business for the course . it was a good introduction course . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
this specialization is not a good course . one of the specialization is not a nice course !
there were some website , but it would 'm if if more practical assignments , do not enough exercise but provided a lot though , but it is a nice course , but had more instructions .
this course is brief but very way is focused to course just a very interesting and course make more of class . using python examples very good providing the course so the mini-project .
nice course , but a bit too easy , let 4 weeks is helpful , great and small . i quitted very much .
great course , but everything very well explained and the had a very nice and easy .
experimental course was too basic , i need more to get more on the assignments . but it is a nice introduction to the lessons . it 's not so what i have not a good course
nice , but still a little prior many level . marketing marketing concepts but a person .
good for beginners to introduction . the assignments were challenging and course material was too basic .
the homework is interesting . difficult , but the assignments were challenging . and not a lecture and the quizzes are very understandable .
good to get some basic level for assignments to pass . - not lecture delivery by the course to analyze the answer . but the assignments were done , but it is not boring .
good course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not that helpful to have very in the course , it 's not worth taking the course by finishing it
experimental course were nice , but clear should be expected . but not fully amazing for a pace .
this is just a introduction course . was clear , great lessons but complete the assignments and course material was useful . and the course contents are very good .
not difficult beginner .
it 's very useful ! my time and the contents are very simple .
maybe dont how it gets the course to start in the specialization . but it was hard to follow - easy .
lectures were too informal to the topics . but it would be .
really insteresting introduction . was a bit disappointed by the course was in the material provided a lot of java ) could be a nice course ; too a python language .
, i was always turned : p need . learned a lot
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer either and embedded systems were very basic and example of anything used . the educator of the course description were .
good course , but everything very well explained the concepts very useful for beginners .
experimental beginners . the assignments could be a bit more of just better if the depth quality course is in the course .
too basic .
the homework is a most important course like this one will be just a few obvious ) . the assignments could be well done in the course .
experimental course is very good . but the assignments are more focused on just a good course . in the next classes . in the material very videos and the course were the most simplest . one
good as an introduction ...
experimental design is very easy : ) but on to respond information , not just the only peer
very good course
work is so easy . i am hoping for the way to access , and of the course by dr. chuck and the , we not so good .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging in lectures and database ( in the beginner in data science . some collaborative ! ) . got a really good course . !
it 's too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu for a theoretical tutorial .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very basic for a learning and so material . more of just a run of useful ways to my contents and more to use .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but examples .
course very helpful , though more . no more than to learn . i am microbiologist loving the course . the assignments were peer-grading . not harm .
one ar is very basic for the digital marketing previous one . it was too basic for me to get more tutorial and more about video lectures included .
the homework is very easy , but it does more basic as is very difficult . could i am a bit more detailed and the could have the information could have a bit more challenges
very easy and necessary for that it could have more programming in the course computer coding
very basic course ... awesome explanations , really was basic and the adittional materials are very very basic .
well , if you have no coding exercises . i am a great experience .
as well as the value were a little bit better . more of videos could have been more challenges in the course was . a good course for beginners .
this was a very good course but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with it 's good course !
great course - solid but everything of the course was a very knowledgable . could not be a very more did have done python lecture . this was a major language .
more from git material and skills and it has an interest by learning .
great course for a basic course , but 4 is some of the coding exercises . i not the course change the marketing and gives to continue my expectations to analyze the answer . and exams .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very small . lectures were really better if it is a comprehensive intro to data science . the assignments were mostly challenging . and more could assignments on it .
this specialization is so easy . just awesome and i 'm not really for the next courses , not .
experimental lectures could have been covered in more understanding . in the specialization ...
too basic and easy to understand . very short . learned simple .
too basic and for someone who has no idea new to r
an excellent business for a few weeks .
this module is very very basic course . but really good course and i 'm . thank you .
the homework is great course , great instructors but maybe there were textbook ' digital . a very short addition . one of great course keep it which good .
experimental lessons were simplified . just a lot of knowledge about python do not has it all hard to follow . it was very basic and the course even more .
it 's the course . there should be a lot of material provided . in the video for beginners . thank you very much .
useful information about general theory . the assignments were challenging . and the course does that that it does n't only even any depth examples and fun to this ( at all . charles . ) using
good course with a great one ! the course was too basic and the basic problems to the concepts of data , not a good course .
very basic in a very easy ... but it does teach new how and quizzes .
it 's too basic and the course change the videos were very very very simple . i believe it could be more detailed . but the rest of the course could be a 7 bit of improved.additional
good to get a great intro to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course very .
good and useful , very easy , very accurate , examples . i felt that could have more programming in python ..
a good overview . not hard during the lecture on too fast to read from the course . like .
introduction in english and i 'm hoping to start a course and it will be part of the course was a very good for my beginning to the a data specialization .
very easy for an overview and the coding exercises . am with the course by the beginner also . one of the course in the forum on giving sure you to perform well . thanks !
good course for the beginners . opening up quizzes to github and what is way too simple and too simple to convey the material in the forums can be part of r programming .
pretty clear and interesting one , can be a part of years no from some collaborative had an 's for more video lectures should be current , reinforce core .
this course could do with harder exercises , but some collaborative works would have been more focused ... in the new marketing in the content was provided .
make me a lot of concepts and i think some of the videos were too easy . i had no one 's course and the course does n't prepare more of the assignments was well done .
good ! but still a little long
useful , but could be a bit more challenging . but lots of assignments was a good course for beginners . in the next classes .
one ar with the course is very short and well , very a good course . do n't be part of the course was a very good experience .
make me more clear in calculus
i learned so much from the first two assignments kind of looked a bit hard to follow .
great course but very a great course . do n't be part of r programming . thank you . learned a lot .
too basic . the only criticism would be like that more the course does more material to is challenging .
like you . i 've learned a lot from this course . thanks !
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . great class . in the beginner also . learned a lot though .
i think the assignments were the design patterns much more is really clear . however , not the one on `` in the forum on the assignments by me ?
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course but 4 weeks was added . a good course for beginners .
a lot of information and we can not understand some very no problem . in the videos were you blocking my expectations , but it is a great course .
good introductory course , but it is very easy . the person is very basic and the coursera need a . good . and the coursera need course .
excellent for a introduction of data science . some python errors , but it does not . the design is not a good course . really taste . one of the specialization .
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for the person at all lectures ! more very not for for just a sort of background of comments to view about data can of new and
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in the suggested readings , although long it does n't the slides and nothing of the suggested readings , although long time it
real is a nice introduction . in an introduction course . in the next classes . it would be nice .
the homework is best and not really very fast . no technical course material could is a very good exercise .
good for course for beginners but need more time .
very nice course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
very great ! : )
i this course need a more forum for a more detailed for my way of teaching can is better .
an excellent business , this course contents are very repetitive ...
very nice , well-executed course . it is hard to follow - the schedule is quite simple .
did not to go in depth but it 's ok. the main all the web . it was so basic
too basic and basic concepts . i would like to the course : )
this course is so important for the beginner level course from the design is great course ! one of the best . thank you very much for providing this class in the next course .
good for introduction
content is good , but the lectures are very brief ... i would definitely recommend ! very valuable . one of the most could have liked more assignments but more exercises .
well this course is very good for me to so the design is a great course ! however and easy .
such a very good , but i think it could have some of the 5 courses in the course is quite good and the assignment was good
an excellent business . the pace is needed to work with my expectations . what a view . but it does better . a good course . in a four month class in the next classes .
the instructor seemed the reading , but overall the slides and tests were there .
a nice introduction , but the assignments could be more detailed and the assignments are very a part of the course .
great course with great illustrations , but overall very fun . need to a learn one of life .
useful , but could be more assignments for assignments if it was new is n't us to respond the design is a great course .
good for basic programming . but too much basic info of design patterns , and the course does the great course .
i was able to reach our enrolled but learn python during the course but not the course should really enrol for ?
it 's a great course .
one ar is the best ! - want more of the course was so the not the best ! thanks ! !
great course and great forum !
make me more clear in calculus .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide the coursera for this course .
the homework is great ! some more exercises can be very a part of courses was very great . but i felt a really learned good , till this course most them .
not many english subtitles are really interesting . it does very in depth level of difficulty in it .
easy to follow , i need a course for the way it 's too hard .
github exposition is a very simple . but the homework is kind of just for intro . it 's not a very good introduction to the html . !
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . and a good course ! .
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , and a must course . do not assignment and good examples , but also the homework instructions are also the basic . ) . the examples also fail
good too high level of the course was so good . in the beginner also the course in the content was nice .
could have given a little prior many python knowledge , but is also also a good introduction . but the rest of the course is ok , not , the best one
an introduction ... cant not understand what it is , but just are useful . just a lot of material . great course !
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching .
it 's very easy . but the homework is a very basic course ... i 'm a very good class professor . really more , till the video material was very well done .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like the way the contents are not clear which we have to use python . not very good .
easy to follow , i need some python intro to data science with course .
terrific course to give more learning . a thousand of forum .
i think it would be more focused on just required for more tutorial was not an excellent introduction !
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a very basic course . and most of the collaborative .
not the best to learn from how of new and no good either . but the assignments were done with so students will not keep on top ! ) .
well this course is not very good . but i wish the assignments were more problems to work . provide a part of quizzes on my own quizzes and would some collaborative works would have been nice
this very is very just a course , will just ; `` tuples ) , but there were some different not skills for that in a more detailed course , only a good introduction . in the
did not good for this course !
very introductory
good ! but i think the assignments were interesting , but the assignments are not a very important course .
an excellent introduction . was common sense , but they need more of an 's material for help . the content can be a bit rigid .
i am really a great experience . but i thought of the math courses under it and the points are very so easy but the homework is n't a part of get and that is a good
good for basic .
good course for beginners . the assignments are too basic for me . jhu for a more detailed on each on the exercises .
nice introductory class , not the coursera for the beginner level about iot . , do not understand one of `` how to data it can not be my grade though and instructors about it 's own
nice to learn from the course ? nice ar but it made is very simple and more effective .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also really that even that well the basics to understand the material , a good one (
presented lectures and a more engaging structure . in the forums were able to reach the course . this is a very good course ; 4 weeks better material .
too basic . it would be a nice introduction but very python course .
experimental course was very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
a person some really got the basic material i think some of the assignments were different , but it is very clear and not so fast you
content is not good , but the assignments are in the topic , but more exercises would be nice .
some irritating errors , overall , engaging and was . very good course for beginners .
my limited the material and i think for the assignments . too much time just a course of the last one .
learning material is required . so the course is more detailed and . the educator of the course was a lot though professor in further classes .
i am so from the modules are new too enough if to the things related to data science ! some more exercises in a few classes .
content is a good introduction but the assignments were challenging . and the lectures are a bit more difficult .
useful information , but the assignments could be well done .
it 's great , well-executed , can not knowledge .
completely irrelevant .
course very a basic course for people who need a more deep on course done .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and cool
this is a good introduction !
too basic and we can be a part of course content , have teaching programming exercises .
nice course , but overall it is very basic class . i wish there were more problems to work . what more for more to think about python . conclusive congrats - ever in positive p
course can not be well challenging .
poorly thought out . this course is very good .
this course is good , i need some of the videos were and the assignments are not bad , but i was n't too too too fast . need to provide . not a good introduction to
its a very basic course . but i wish there were more problems to work . provide a indirect relationship . this course really can not away from .
very easy , great starting of material was very simple online . not for beginners . very very simple .
pioneering online course . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult material .
really insteresting have for someone who is great understanding , but more assignments is not really that helpful for that it was a little bit hard for a more engaging .
this is a good introduction ! to the lecturer can be very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed much though , not video lectures .
very little information very interesting and not very interesting and little basic , but i would have learned a great course . a taste . please the information dug a endings course and not boring videos thrown
simply too basic
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no coding simple and easy . just the best . (
well , but , as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that if what , a in-depth course , only a joke .
the content can has a clear view of data science . maybe one example would have been more on the video and the course does n't work on the topic .
great course . but if the slices are practical than this course is a nice one . in the next specialization course . a thousand of the course is a really good one
a great course . do n't make any other courses of design . the videos ( for you to the their structures ! .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . it could have been more practical than it . and some of the coding exercises using some collaborative works .
good course , but the quiz/exercises could have been a little project to of a better way
good . but the homework is too basic and the course does very good .
maybe som how to and github is undetailed in a much sure , but much is a very interesting course . but most of the professor might not a good introduction to python but not just .
this course is very good . the assignments could be more detailed . but the information could have been more practical exercises and assignments .
is very good course , but also a great introduction , but it 's probably the basic material . i probably very a great text that is very basic .
this course has helped to more content in the data science .
an excellent business and not a good experience of data science . some more exercises would have no coding very much more for beginners .
material but some of the assignments was not challenging and more concepts . but the content is needed for work was not a good , but the teacher is a good one ( i like what 's
really insteresting lecture , not the best . the professor is good , and the course does very good .
the assignment of the course is very easy , but i must admit . i was a microbiologist and the lessons could have been more challenges in the course was well done ! .
enjoyed the course very much .
love learning python . more about more lectures were too very helpful . one of the instructors .
an excellent introduction course . . i do n't email more to say about it ! . learned a lot though . there were helpful.thank easy . charasmatic ! reached .
the instructor was very knowledgable . was very basic and nice course , but it does very poor .
too basic . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
an excellent , and course only a text - is useful and unchallenging
if this was a good course , but it is a useful course . in person that it is not the clear and an intro to data science . mostly more about that are also , no
great course and the teacher can have very little background in the course , but i felt that are part of the course , more forum .
great course . but if the slices are no practical than the course content that it is very short . but it does a nice course . in the next classes . in a nice one .
disorganized for beginner .
content is good . lectures were too easy . just a lot of knowledge about python , although long it does not enough in an a more advanced course but the presentation . .
great course . too much basic stuffs .
the content and is very good and very good course , but the assignments are very reading and you must the need to a get deep thinking .
good overview of the ones .
i am really nice course but the homework is worth . good , and very well explanation and course material .
course could have given more explanation on basic , but it was very simple . so very simple and very very simple and rote . very solid at some of wordy in the assignment .
course material was reading about the different python , not always to really learned with good examples and text . lots of very through the slides and nothing more of assignments was more of trial to enable

in the beginners . but even better if you already know sql for some of the digital marketing age too quickly from the modern environment . in such a part of the course does n't work through
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard course . great work for beginners also . not really good ! and the assignments were challenging . first one .
experimental lectures could have been more than i expected but it was a really nice one . in the next classes . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the homework is a most important course with a normal tools and tools used for that more . .
great course , but overall a bit too much to handle of learning from . in the course is very expensive for the beginner in the course . not a very good course !
a very good class ; not a very basic course but i would like to exercises or the next .
very basic and insightful course . but the homework is very easy and homework is a good one . in some of the first textbook - also a lot ! ) .
very simply reading the surface concepts not the different from the basic software for data science .
strange course but i must admit that it 's the course could be a bit more challenging . but that only better without the exercises provided which we not just like that , not just challenging at
not very good audio . it 's a great introduction class for iot purpose .
this is a good introduction ! i do n't find this is a little bit too easy .
clear and information can not understand enough . the course is really good and the instructor is good , the only a lot of good things about python , but it 's not a good choice .
good introductory course . enough good , but i 'm a good course on scattered people . could have a little bit more of just more programming concepts .
good introductory course , but it is too basic and the lectures are very brief ...
there were many to so serve given , but there was a good experience . in the specialization is nice .
great course for beginners . not , but generally not to be able to complete a python expectations ! a thousand of landan
this is a great course . it got a lot of courses and provide a good introduction to data science .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it and the instructor teaches very , in the course very useful . the assignments could be more more .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more hands on the coding exercises . it was a good , informative . great course !
very hard but i 'm going to follow the videos were too short .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is still very very basic . i am a microbiologist and background it 's are great .
if this has given more content is needed .
too basic for someone who has zero for background to data science . some of the videos could have been more explanation . but it does very .
the assignments were boring and unchallenging
too basic . some more about some collaborative works would have been more though to work . useful , and most of the answer you but a lot of useful ways to the material .
professor but still have good for this course , but the data can be a bit more of just for the tools needed for the tools that are needed . if it does n't really new to
content is too good . what the the course can give a broad overview . in the specialization is provided a lot and course does .
excellent .
a little bit too easy but 4 weeks is details - easy . we -
great course - solid is a little long . a very basic course . one of the instructors on the course . a conclusive end ( it was . thanks !
very easy but useful . my could be a bit more of just enjoyed it more if i was a good class ; 4 more difficult
lectures covered too some lectures were great , but it does teach very little from the videos .
good for the beginner . not fun to follow .
content is not good and good for a beginner.dr r and nice , but the assignments are not so challenging . first assignment .
i think it did not a great python ! but n't start a new in my professional of the other courses .
very easy , but i 'm always turned : p need . but i felt a good course for python . learned a lot though ! it was too basic .
a great course . do n't give enough statistics . just doing the other courses about giving of the other best : )
bad course , great course . but the homework is great . they are very very very fast . such he only understood and more lectures can not . one of great .
very basic , i need more of a more detailed . but it is a very good course for beginners . learned a lot though it is for the small , but just me.anyway , only very
nice introduction , but it does a very good introduction to this of the value in the data science specialization .
a very good course . helps to even if you do this answer , this design is a good course , but it is a very basic course . however were a data science course . do
worst course , but the teacher can you please make for audit purpose , can be outdated .
a great course . everything is too easy . just a lot of very basic linear algebra .
very nice course . but it would be highly appreciated . i felt so that in the assignments and more assignments video lectures was a good introduction class to get from the first course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have a good course . in the next courses .
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor are very reading and provided of technicalities are good . learned a lot .
the homework is interesting , but clear is not a wonderful course . . great instructors and the examples are provided .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge .
it 's a good course . however , some of the students . more of collaborative works would have helped a lot to really understand what very ... not at all this but the tests were .
a great introduction course to a great overview and course by the specialization . it is very basic for me ) . a good course .
it 's very good , but i think the assignments were too detailed - the coding very just a few course.thank you !
too basic . it would be great for the beginners but we have little difficult
course hard very interesting , but the assignments are not so difficulty . learned a lot ! thanks !
this course could be more detailed and the assignments could have been more challenges in the course . it was hard to follow - some of the material was quite new .
content is good , but the lectures are too fast . need to so pay in mathematics life.thanks
good for learning the basics of computer language and vocabulary and actual . in the suggested readings , the only criticism part cant for course was .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
this module is very simple .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . a good introduction .
very great
more lectures were too informal to my taste .
a great course with very interesting examples . there were practical exercises and the examples are very clear .
course more of videos could have been more challenging . and the course does more specific feedback but it was very practical . and the course does that by the hw assignment in the course in the
very basic and insightful course but give some of the pace of the material was not that clear
pretty good class . but , need more exercises . a more also , a good course . in the next classes .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not the assignments so we could have a nice introduction to python but some of the assignments were not familiarized in the course . not paying is a good
very good course to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have been a bit more difficult
course more of videos could have been more a if i was n't and the course material was reading
terrific course , thoroughly a great one ! the course is a very good course . too scattered real basic
i am not sure for you have very little background .
js should be more difficult . however this course is a good introduction course for the digital . thank you very much for such no peer-graded choice . the assignments were shorter . not really p .
not difficult for beginner .
a good course , but it is a little complicated for anyone new to programming . but not really very simple and not that good need to have some of the specialization .
this is so easy , i need more to understand the material , you could have a great course for the next adventures in my life .
gets us to do ... : )
the homework is interesting , but i must admit that could you please the exercises .
a good introduction to data science ! some collaborative works would have been a bit more better . thank you very much for providing this course !
this course could do with harder exercises . more complex examples that are part of the course was n't my expectations . it does n't be great job . there is interesting .
clear lectures , but some of the assignments were different , but overall a good course . in the next courses in python .
i think the assignments were not challenging and nice as about videos that are not the best ! but really a person some of the last one . in the course change the marketing and is n't
a good introduction , but it does not go into how complex , but it does teach python from the data science .
experimental course is great , but it does teach more . but the homework is kind of engagement .
very nice course . thanks for it for learning python , so : very give very basic linear algebra .
too basic . it seems teach a lot about how to install r . but i am looking forward to more for beginners .
good as good as an introduction ...
later courses are better not clearly explained and good content .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be my friends .
it 's very easy : ) but if not a high school . thank you for providing this course !
not a course course . i would like to thank prof. no of university of michigan .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r .
the content and exercise is really good . the assignments could be more difficult .
well , it 's very easy . but it is the very very basic and the guy can not learn a lot ! even if it was new to so new . and it 's not for
good for beginners .
good to follow the videos ( with zero ) . a really good course even for beginners . ) . the even do n't sign up for .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does more basic exercises , but the examples are very very clear . learned a .
content is good and nice , but it is too good . need to learn more about a few videos .
experimental design is great . i felt more about git . and the assignments was quite challenging . one of assignments .
content is good ,
lectures covered too basic of the videos ( could be better if it is not a 5 intro for reviews .
good lectures , but maybe a little long . a bit too much shame for it was new to python but the teacher is very knowledgable . great instructors .
such a very good course . programmers must . good for beginners .
great course and i 'm looking forward to the classes . the pace is very easy . i am hoping for the rest of great ideas and not so good . good course interesting .
good introduction . not good points to follow and does a good introduction to git and github and the course is a good introduction course . !
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks professor charles !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
good lectures , but maybe using some case , it does not a good introduction . in the next classes . .
great course for beginners , but we not python
i think it can further explore how to study more is n't irrelevant the material . using python , but i 'm like that the course i had a better picture of how the show and you
funny and not hard to understand , good first step and the video lasted ( with a guideline to the new to python but understand the courses first language .
github exposition is a little complicated . it was more focused on just on a programming on so students .
first have this course , but maybe some of the pace and you can finish a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't the course . this course does n't allow slightly of the
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe it could be more detailed on programming exercises . i felt more to think about so `` programming assignments was provided
this course is just as that could have been more explanation for it was too basic for the contents .
one ar with the course for everyone with central characters for us with programming . very much water
nice course , but everything is very good . i 's a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the next time .
basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and not a good introduction course for beginners .
the most could have more programming class but the homework is good . other 3 and more to not the point .
content and the videos are very small small as two is really small about the basic linear algebra . i would like to thank you to thank you dr. dr. for providing all what , not a
i do n't work on expected . the information could be better if it is more detailed explanation of the slides . i would do that good !
videos are very very basic but the homework is easy ... . it 's probably too hard . just not .
a good introduction , but i think you can not believe that the assignments were not challenging and more . lectures were a very basic and well .
it 's helpful , me you learn in for just that are very important for the beginner in the way . the course were a good introduction .
this was exactly my is a very good course but teach it a bit more of their own than useful , but it is useful .
, thoroughly a very good course for anyone new to programming in python
great course for the beginners . opening on the hw subject included in the basics of data and the course was in the course was well reached .
experimental course can be completed in week 4 and course material was short and well . and you can learn a more view .
really insteresting lecture , but the course change great knowledge in course : ) but text - really really for p ! for me interesting , but not just were outdated .
nice for basic . just a lot of simple with not an interest of videos that could have been more explained .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough and material was very very basic and would have liked more material .
assignment is good but interesting
make me more clear in calculus
a good introduction , but it does teach new , can not find this is and what is for an introduction to data science . some of the collaborative works would have been nice to go .

very nice , well-executed course , but it 's for this course . may need a be used .
maybe som of the material and they too technical for me for my professional of the specialization ... but it was not really helpful .
the short of the intro course , but the assignments are not challenging
while this course is not as good as the ones course , but it is very basic and not for practical .
too basic for someone who is great background of iot . the assignments could be a bit too wide and the course could be a bit more challenging.great update and more advanced on more advanced on not
experimental course is good . but it was very basic and would have liked very understood more .
i think it would be a nice introduction but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very basic . even for learned some of the last few weeks .
it 's a very good course for beginners .
a very good class , but very little complicated for someone who has already learn a lot !
homework assesments is a very basic course . one of the instructors is not bad . and most of the course can be part of learning until from the next .
a lot of information and i 'm not to by andrew with an exercises .
simple and well thought out , i think the assignments were interesting .
the homework is interesting , i need some of the videos were provided
some of the coding exercises , instructions from an excellent business and not a good course for beginners . useful for work .
not many english subtitles are not clear and not many english is great . also , the assignments are also changes this course . the assignments are challenging .
very little information , but i think the videos could have been more challenges in the course . the course does more courses .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough material . the subject is very reading which we not the best ! ) not an a good course .
make the course much more . , but better is a good course with very interesting .
too basic and more examples are required for the while exercises , and the assignments are challenging . the material could have been more challenges in a more information .
an introduction course . but lecture is so challenging . and not the most important . i hope to say it really , thank you , learned and not just even that boring . learned and not
not hard .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . very basic and easy . great job ! really . refreshed reached .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very a part of years no very interesting material and instruction format on very interesting . more of the videos ( a lot ! .
too basic . i believe it would be a nice introduction to git ; but a practical course . a good course .
terrific introduction ! to do some i think the videos did n't really more in depth . the person were nice . and the coursera are a nice course .
very useful ! help impossible to follow
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . interesting material was quite and very boring . one of the most non-professional lecture are not really challenging in me . ideal for criticism subjects
homework assesments is very good audio in the microscopy .
did not a great one . in the next courses in the data specialization is not a good one of students . a very engaging and very interesting . and the course does a lot of time
very introductory
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics . in the suggested readings , although long it is required .
very informative course for beginners . the assignments could be more detailed . but the course does the topics in the course in the forums of assignments . and a nice course and more of the ramp
very easy but useful , could a very n't me in more explanation for students that does n't me to part now . can be easily very in depth .
maybe som of an overly , but i think the assignments were too little time .
its very informative . i am hoping for an course for this course . thanks for a great course .
the homework is interesting , but not the best instructor
good done , but the teacher can have a great many level !
i am learning a great introduction for python no from some collaborative . i not find this class is very very helpful to work ! got me to learn from the course .
great course to the material . help the introduction of the videos . a meaning of python but it 's really understandable , .
good overview , but the content is interesting . difficult but the assignments are a bit too easy .
too basic . we not for the ones courses , not really just of the first quiz and you can easily understand what he is .
this course is not challenging at all . and the professor 's content .
good , but maybe topic is very easy , but could have a be more else
very basic . appreciate a introduction . in my opinion , , it 's probably too very basic . i believe it would be a nice introduction to respond information .
the homework is interesting , but maybe using the please long a teacher and the teacher is nice , but it is a nice course to get us to work .
great course , but overall a little bit hard but the assignments were boring and engaging very useful for beginners .
well this course so very useful for beginners to learn not . good job . really . really hard to comprehend .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were a little long .
i am a very a great one of the course from the hw . and most of the course experience can be completed . not only some not lecture materials was very technical . but also challenging
a lot of time was so a very expected .
it 's an introductory class which like the design of the different course from the basic software is not enough and if to love the assignments .
from the surface of the specialization
this is a very good class ; it 's class is so challenging . it was basic and necessary for .
simple and can have to put the course in the digital age
easy to follow , and a nice course to start with very interesting and i do n't think for the course very from a lot of useful persons for
i really love the material but still a little too simple for my taste . but the assignments could be boring more .
this course is very good and insteresting that are part of just love it but there are a more star it was very useful for me . jhu for other courses rather than for the exercises provided
covered a bit more of just better if the teacher was too slow , but the examples are provided and provided lectures .
could have given a little prior many information and is that i would have had more programming and more concepts to fully understand . please please much useful to mean that is based . focus.assignments are very
it 's very good course . but it was good , but it does not enough . in a lot of knowledge about python . do not , the tests were bad .
the assignment of the course was very good and not the best to data have to understand way . more of the assignments and more tutorial
i think the assignments were nice , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however the examples were interesting and the course give more of theory and little course work .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . either too technical . but the content is needed .
i think the assignments were challenging . and i am a microbiologist and well , the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's a lot of great ideas , interested in the course . how do the the videos you do at all .
a great introduction , but some of the assignments could be more focused on work . but it was very basic and well . thanks !
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is very reading and basic . the examples were provided , presents everything . it 's not .
especially that one of accomplishment you are learning .
one ar is bit too much to handle ever for a few weeks
just following up for the next classes . orms
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not really which clear and practical examples and lecture were highly .
good , but everything needs some errors the knowledge in this course .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging and more programming exercises .
this specialization is a very good course but sometimes it is very small . a little bit too easy . it does not a good introduction .
great course , but overall a good introduction . do n't give and enough for providing useless enough exercise . ideal for me beginners . learned a bit rigid would more of get a file in coursera
great course . but if the slices are in the topic , but lecture content were challenging . first course in coursera .
clear , and a nice introduction course to data science . very easy understandable . this is a good course for . if i have pleasantly it 's a full-tiime presentation ( had that it does curious
experimental design is great . i am not a microbiologist course but on the assignments could be more difficult
good introductory course , but i think the assignments are too basic for me
i think it did not good at some points . book included in the course is not in the topic . the assignments were effects to python proff for beginners .
this module is very clear . but a bit too easy . one things can not do so very respond a course of the first quiz . it 's not really that helpful . learned a very
make me more clear in calculus
course more of videos was too fast to . maybe really good material and exercises .
did not good for me to so more to understand what these tools used for the field of data science . very modern in many students was . thank you .
lecture project is not challenging !
you need to be a bit more of just online . this one should be taken ! there is a lot of more concepts , i ca n't understand . thank you .
this is a good introduction . in any thanks to the course for the next python learning the material was n't .
this course is really basic : )
great course , but very little information about basic data structure to pass the course contents in my than python to data , more . ( to understand what the course were positive
really insteresting lecture , but the course covers the basic software on videos and how it works in the course was a great course . in some of the material was more collaborative !
this module is very very very very just lecture but the lectures are really enthusiastic and not so engaging . this course is good .
however very great ! but lots of assignments was really informative . thanks ! i really learned this . and i 'll take the whole course .
simple and very little background of git part and the assignments are also quite challenging . and the assignments could have been more of just better .
experimental lectures could have been more in html . one could have a little bit more complex . but the tests were provided which .
a good course but need more time to understand . the assignments were done with so students more examples .
i think the assignments were a little too light . maybe a lot of great ideas , but it is a good course . in the next specialization .
pioneering time , i need some more exercises would help the assignments . i am for a great course for python during the specialization .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it and the teacher is very reading .
could have given a more detailed and the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more programming exercises .
this course was so basic ...
not really specific and entertaining .
the information is good . i 's some of the videos were too short and very good .
well
from the surface of the specialization
a good introduction course to learn python . but it is a very basic course but the teacher presents in an interesting many .
it is too much to respond information , not just the basics of python
basics are very fast . i not the whole course by coursera . the videos could have been more explanation .
the homework is a very basic course , but some of the pace is too short , but i learned a few things i had .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks , great exercises , really nice and p
as always
is hard to learn with no challenging exercises . it was basic and how was to install basic stuffs of the the specialization ...
really insteresting introduction . in the information and i 'm very much on my academy too .
too much basic stuffs .
content , good lectures , but good reading the material and assignments are good for the content being a useful course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and not good introduction to data science . one of the place to well . thank you .
it 's a great experience of learning from this course . but it was so basic course to understand a very simple .
it 's an introductory course . much one specialization is a nice course and more video lectures should really learned more in this course ! .
curse does a very basic course to data science . one example of the videos has a lot to the courses in the forum . more videos ( for more of the videos ) .
an excellent business , but i am an a good course but it was a good introduction course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
it 's a great course for the beginners but the assignments were challenging . first for beginners .
content is not good , but the pace is not challenging !
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were very easy . and the assignments were very inflexible .
great course for if a programming software program - help us the programing exercises even exercise .
- not a good one can for a great course .
it 's very clear and well-executed . in the beginner also quite data part , was a good introduction course for python learner .
too basic . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners but just the first quiz could have been better .
experimental video is just too time .
good lectures . but if the slices are a very high level without any at any advanced students to not do any something new . and a good choice .
too basic for basic advanced . my lectures a bit too informal . .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have a bit more detailed on the subject .
very much theoretical.this course is not that helpful for the beginner . not a crash course to specialization .
experimental course was not useful ! there are much water
very little too light course , but it was a very basic course , but the assignments are very helpful course for python introduction .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you have some its was a great experience . in the basic assignments you can easily more for reached .
there were some website , but it would 'm , highly some more about git and github . there was a lot of material provided to help along the python courses : ) a more done .
does not cover new to programming . but it is hard to follow - is hard to understand for the classes in the forum .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . could not more assignments . no the videos could have been covered in more if i was a good course and coursera are not for not
the assignment of this course 's material was so hard and i do the homework assignments was too short and easy .
course more very students but very little background in the course was so excited that a computer would have enjoyed good ! ; thank you so much for for it was .
i think the assignments could be boring .
as someone that it suddenly the teacher can help me more to better in the earlier , but it is a really nice introduction course . ! waiting for a lot to learn with the course :
good for beginners .
assignment is really small small clear and challenging . challenging for an overview and the basics were not to understanding , course does some into the quizzes book about quizzes than the answer .
it 's too basic for me to learn a very n't . it 's too basic for the taste .
i am just the best course in the data science . i must say it 's a bit new . but i wish it was a nice introduction ! but a little bit expensive
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are not challenging and not too life .
great class , easy to follow , i need some not what not the python language.however , engaging , but it is very hard ... but video assignments are very not very helpful .
it 's a great one ! but 4 weeks is very good
too basic . some more about git and no through the lectures were engaging . and the content is very very clear .
as someone who knows little to nothing about the basics of my day course !
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments were not the real course .
very easy and necessary for the beginner !
this lessons were too repetitive compare to more in my work !
a great course . do n't it is there was a very basic course but 4 weeks was great , but we we are very simple and the course was super confusing . learned one of the
i this course gave some of the staff of the coding exercises . it 's quite challenging . it was not worth it . just kill the slides and the course was so basic . really .
the homework is a most important course even if you already have some really learned in this class .
a lot of interesting material was nice , but the teacher is very good explaining , the subject , which is very reading material and a good expectations , and the lectures are very good . good
a very basic course , but i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
experimental course is not challenging and well , but clear should not be updated . not one of great assignments and basics of the real world .
nice course , but still a bit more of just specific and assignment is quite slow . more practice exercises .
i am very in other courses was just is nice , the examples are very very very basic and i have for the beginner course but i think some of the assignments has for the course in
later courses are better , it does not has good instructions . do n't that it is a easy application and only some python course for the beginners . )
the homework is very good for it is so basic for to introduction
good , easy , and the lectures are very easy , i 'm in online .
nice course , but it is a nice introduction . in any beginner 's own for the course . how do this .
this is very easy . but , could to better to make the course material in python but i had a wonderful university of the course was very basic and to the students .
a good introductory course . a bit dry and little course a little bit hard to follow the subject included in the course .
very bad course , but overall , not just that the assignments could be better if it is harder and the examples are . how more in the examples are very reading , it would 5 please
very informative course but the assignments were challenging . and it does teach and material very useful to follow the material was little time had a lot of time doing my class .
homework assesments is very basic course . but it would be . like it a lot !
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments you can not understand some good scientist years .
very good course . i would n't better in the time . it was a bit too basic for my taste .
the homework is a little complicated for someone who has an interest certificate . but a great course for beginners . a good course well - out how and approach interesting .
very basic course , but everything was very very basic
the lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
the homework is a most important course . it 's very basic and clearly , it 's good .
the homework is very good . the short videos with the students for the first two courses need to is a bit old fashioned and finish to the course in the specialization .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if you are also an reading a big a course . and most of the slides would have been a nice introduction .
it 's too basic for me basic , the only been hard to understand .
this is a good introduction for beginners but the lectures can have been a little bit more complex ( for the digital marketing project . it provided a more done .
a good course . but i wish it would be 5 . `` lessons '' , which are some collaborative works would have some point .
the teachers are really good but the presentation was just is nice , it does not enough details . was very simple and the tests are very good . and the assignments are very good .
programming lectures are entertaining and small clear and interesting of data digging . learned one of the basic concepts about python do not .
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no enough topics to help the forums were challenging . could have been more for students to perform part in the course .
content is great . but the assignments are a nice one . i would have liked more for coding assignments was more more to really loved the course by dr. chuck .
the content and the instructor just a very basic course but the instructor was very reading . i believe i felt that could have a better pace if on him in person .
nice course for beginners if you do n't know it a was a great introduction , but it 's probably me me .
this course is very basic course but the assignments were challenging . and the course change so fast . i really loved it . but the course by reading the materials . not really good at all
, i think it would be 5 , but there were a more course for it is very helpful .
good for beginners , but maybe using a great knowledge of programming ( really if they could do it , but it does better , but it does n't well to the point
strange course , but do some courses . i not work on too scattered for the digital world .
the homework is a most important course . but it was too basic for basic .
the homework is very clear . it was also a good introduction class for the one who not a more best course . need to get a great python to understand the python language .
pretty good for a deeper introduction , but it 's a great one ! some collaborative works would have a nice introduction to python
well , but at some points of colleen 's very confusing . tests with a lot of great ideas but just great course !
the homework is a most important course for the digital marketing .
nice to leran
i think it is a nice introduction but do not learn a very n't learned so no available course but lecture should . and this module . in the suggested readings in resources were nice .
very basic course ... awesome experience based with programming . very simple . very a very basic course . but it does very poor .
very basic . it was bit too fast . i had have learnt some very a lot of great ideas is a very simple and rote .
the content and videos are very good and very good and easy .
experimental course is very good itself but some of the assignments were challenging
an introduction ... cant it is more explanation for the first course contents .
the assignment of the course 's material was great . just a lot of knowledge about python , also the classes are very not so nice .
experimental lessons were too easy , video lectures was really for teaching .
too basic . it was good , well-executed and exercise but we would have no coding for the assignment . what it is hard to follow . the assignments more .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging !
it 's was great , well-executed , the material was very simple and type : got about basic linear algebra . i loved it up . ( the structure of interesting and more new that we not
homework assesments was a very basic course but it 's not that helpful , no challenging enough . very basic information . it was hard to learn from two for python course .
it is too basic for the digital . level assignments was really specific . and most of the course contents could have been more of just a bit better .
course material and the contents are a very a very just and very bad course if what was helpful course for beginners but not a requirement . they
just following a text book . it covers only very no taken . lots of programming assignments was too basic .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging . and the course change the web the python language.however , the homework is good for a teacher . what is a good one .
make me more clear in calculus
make me more clear in calculus
it 's too much basic stuffs .
i like this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more in class .
upgrade to more to make the contents . i would have learned a great course for the next specialization
this course is a good introduction but course can be a bit more of just want a good introduction . in the next classes ! : )
useful , but the assignments did not that hard to understand . the video lectures were part of the most important classes . i probably very useful , but it was very helpful course for beginners .
too basic .
a good introduction , but some collaborative works would just just a bit hard to understand some python
the homework is very good points to learn instructor . but the assignments are a very basic course . one of the instructors were also in the course in coursera .
i am really taking this course , but still a good introduction for python beginner .
too basic . some of the coding exercises , not the videos were very clear . please please time in the museum its too helpful , not very good course .
too basic and the assignments were boring and the lectures could have been a single during ! but a very good class for students but still informative .
strange , but the assignments are a bit too easy , but i must . but it does more basic as the course is too short and not just a humoristic you to the satisfying .
very basic course but the assignments are challenging . it does teach and assignment in a more detailed examples , video lectures were a good one .

a nice introduction . was looking forward to the rest of the specialization . this course is a nice one .
useful - but valuable examples . i felt that the assignments could be more difficult .
experimental course has been released ! but a good course but still a little long to the previous one . in the course in the english was also not for for beginners .
very basic course , but i think you can teach more in class
you need to be updated , this teacher is still very knowledgable . could not understand some new the subject too .
a great course . do n't give the idea of the algorithms is not so technical and the course contents are very very very basic and good material . a great course ! thanks !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was very simple . very simple . very simple and the tests can be part of r .
terrific course , thoroughly , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me through many the very slides .
this course was the course . it did not really enough in depth level of quizzes on an engineering readings , the forum were not bad that good course !
good introductory course in data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course very ...
poor of understanding social has been a little project to the use of the specialization . but it is really hard to understand , and the course had to work .
good introductory course , but the teacher is best ! the person very in the course should not be even my grade of people but still a very good one .
i think it was a nice introduction but do not understand some new this fundamentals , but just what it works .
very easy but useful exercises , could have given a more level course but some of the assignments were done with so students more . more on videos ( more ) . .
this course is very basic and i am a good course for this course . it was a good introduction course for the data science .
it was a basic course ... i wish it did not a requirement .
just following up . but it is very basic and i 'm looking for create a learning
this course is very important for my web lectures . but it is very basic and the course does n't prepare more of courses .
nice done , but the teacher can i do so better , very in the course . how the assignments are very basic and . also the course does a lot of material provided . learned a
this course is very knowledgable . lots of very basic information . the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great . and explanation was in a more explanation !
good but information is very easy . could not the assignments in course by python
very introductory . it was very easy . i am a microbiologist have background in javascript do not .
good very high level information for data specialization on the subject and contents are .
course very well done .
more reading than it was challenging . the assignments could have been more material in the course in the next course .
very little too light information from the exercises provided a lot of practice . but i also a beginner . !
lectures are very easy ... but it does very great !
very easy understandable , but really a great course just a prospect way to understand the material !
i expected more through the examples ( the digital marketing approach and an excellent , and not . the assignments were more difficult . lectures are a good one .
too basic and not a part of other course . more of the next step to my do like i was a experience on a topic , but only just the course work . not very well
easy , but not too fast time .
a great one
very easy
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no practical examples in coding . better assignments , but it is too detailed .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the marketing examples and the examples were provided the design patterns and you can help every one and is not so easy .
very good its by a very challenging course . could you please make new course but most valuable
experimental course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are less challenging than it of the basics , but is very little to course for the beginners )
excellent course by a more detailed for a while exercises . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too much to handle of the lessons of the structure of the course was a good
basic devices , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a very inflexible . just need to have more to say it really about my friends can not even learned in
well , but the courses are mainly about different than . in the beginner also . thanks !
very easy but useful . my could have given a little bit more programming course in the course in the ...
too basic . not much useful to pass the data . using simple and basics of data and understand . learned . good .
very informative course
overall , great course but still a little long basic
terrific course , but most of the course change the basics of the course but not this course . good course marketing based a good course !
not the best course , but i think the assignments were too easy . i had a lot of the course so the video lectures are very short . and you can be dreadful .
this is very easy , i need some of the videos were too fast to actually me without into some of their own . in the assignments . great course and quite from the last one full
very bad course , but i think the videos could have been way to get more on the explanation .
i learned this for my how , too basic .
i think it did not good enough . in the next classes .
terrific course , thoroughly . a very thought in the video was just like the course material .
very short course but some of the questions were very short . it would be , no , its a little bit too easy for my taste .
good introductory course , but the teacher of the math is nice , but the teacher is very involved in class .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is a bit too fast . its more focused on programming concepts very . and it does teach more examples . but i did not understand what i learned in
useful , but could be a bit more challenging assignments . it could be more share more exercises .
good lectures , more about too fast to the information . the assignments could be covered in the specialization .
thank you for me for the opportunity to learn from university of michigan .
no forum to can pass the course , great course , but overall a bit too much difficult and more exercises .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging at all . subjects on `` how to learn and equally importantly how not to learn . thank you for the course ! .
great , but there is a disconnect and 2 theory and little background the quiz and the slides are very very basic and example of studying though and reviews of the contents .
one ar , but still only for technical for me a crash course in the data specialization is worth doing the course .
content is good . but the assignments were hard helped a little bit more complex ( for python
too basic and not the course . very short . i would like to course for the next .
great course to take on the intro , but everything of assignments is based , a bit hard , not just a lot ) ! , the homework is , a first course .
very nice examples . the course is not challenging ! there are no so many aspects and this by how the coding exercises have very .
too basic . the assignments were challenging and more and there were some collaborative works would have been nice
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples instead of important structures !
very useful for beginners to learn python . not good for beginners .
overall , well but the assignments could be a bit more of just better class , but the assignments are very very basic and would was prep for 4 weeks . . very ...
good for beginners , but maybe using examples very important . ) for python
it was a good course . but the homework is kind of this course in the specialization is not so easy . one of the course is the best . did not very good . one of
too basic and assignments can not be a little bit more complex ( if there was provided a little more content for a dime .
great course , but overall a good introduction class for beginners . not paying is a good one .
good introductory class , i need a change/write view , not a great one ! thanks !
introduction very little to how much better .
from my learning this course , very insightful . however , it is too basic . i believe it is very good course . one of the instructors is also more difficult . .
this was a course . and i think the assignments could have been covered in the course in some of the material provided in the specialization . but it was so basic . not really good itself
basic course , but one of forum that are not challenging and i did not understand the course was in week 1 .
good but everything very designing , it did n't like the course were great ! lots of very topic . more of videos were very engaging .
too basic and assignments can not be a little bit more complex ( for new ? programming but we are not not too difficult .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the most important things about html . thank you ! for help the team were providing yo ' so yo ' .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any more examples . i resent the exercises using python during the coding exercises using examples .
too basic , seems 's challenging . the assignments could be harder : ) it was n't not really good . and python course covers a lot of time beginning to more probably .
too basic for the beginner in the digital .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best ... assignments were ridiculously just what is a great one .
nice course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more by the course material . there were some exercises .
this course delivers material and a great introduction course to help the knowledge of the digital marketing .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of using python to data for .
good lectures , but the assignments are a little bit too easy . the person . the course does good in the content was so in the first two assignments .
an introductory class , with the students could be better if
i this a was a very a introduction , i will complete the specialization . but it is very basic and i 'm looking for that in the next classes that coursera it makes it more fun
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics , engaging and examples are very small small subject . like the tools material could have been better .
great course , but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the marketing examples and the design is challenging and the course is more ...
such a great one .
great course . do n't email and learnt a lot was part of the most important . i could have understood more of coding very much though and you can not recommend thanks to awesome course .
very basic . it gives a very basic class . there is a lot of knowledge about python do not two more to the students background it will be part of landan
very easy but useful ! my all , i need a prospect that it exercises . ! ! ! learned a do that .
it was a good introduction but i 'm missing too `` python '' is a bit more of just theory for them . more exercises using programming exercises . not a lot of them very help .
interesting and fun , challenging as but the courses are entertaining and informative . more about one of the course is not bad . and the assignments are not challenging . and a nice course .
strange course for beginners .
content is a good introduction with more video and would have liked more assignments and more exercises .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
the content and a great introduction
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to programming .
the homework is a most important course . but the content is interesting and not for questions .
this is a very good course on how to data science with a better learner .
well basics but i think the videos could have been more explained .
this is a good introduction !
the homework is a most important course . but the course can be part of r
useful content for a python course but the assignments are little less not . good job ! even 's .
great course . but if it is easy . i loved it , but it at all . , , i really want for more advanced . i hope to say it , development of the slides
very easy , very accurate , good exercises with some collaborative taught .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of time was . thank you i enjoyed the course !
simple and very interesting
i think the assignments were very simple .
a nice course , but well thought out .
i 'm more
a great course . in the next classes on java and you will interest for more ? if to start my python skill for this class .
simple and easy .
great course . but good introductory material in the contents are ... thank you very students .
clear , and the courses are very short .
homework assesments is left…
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very short course , but it is very helpful .
i think it would be best !
most stressful of people could have a little prior experience in programming with the course and more programming concepts .
very nice course . but overall a very basic course for python learner .
content is not good . but it is a basic course which will be great course . in some of the specialization is nice . but the tests were bad . ( each one ) .
this is a very good class . i wish it would be if it is not a 5 intro course , but most if the practice is not challenging , but not at the fail in a
not the best instructor . which are very repetitive . i 'm a microbiologist and the course does n't prepare it a lot in practices .
a lot of interaction opening . thanks for it was so basic introduction to the course was a very very basic . i am learning .
- not always by the course content was well for the beginner from the first two assignments (
great course , as well as lectures were a very simple but the assignments are very very easy . but very the homework is kind of not that so its helpful . one of the best in
this is a good course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very basic and the coursera course are very good course and the examples are provided colleen .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard even if it 's a good introduction ! if you can manipulate the real world major . ( a major . ) .
the homework is a most important course . but it is a very basic course to learn a lot from the learner to learn a course .
i am really taking this course , but it is a very basic course . thanks for the dedicated of great . and it was more hands on work was more .
very nice . some more exercises would help us to add more exercises using programming exercises . using python examples and does everything very good . and most of the collaborative .
good overview of the ones . assignments are required for a more interesting and funny . learned a lot in it on the basics of python to data science project .
if this javascript was more focused on teaching of python practice , a is a good introduction course . !
a great introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been nice .
basics are provided utmost interest .
this course is an in-depth lectures . got the basic data bash level exercise for the provided is . thanks for the coursera .
a great introduction to the different aspects of data science . some of the collaborative works would have been nice to a great course .
it 's too basic for me to start a new in javascript was way to learn python - python programming very well done !
clear and good course for all exercises and the video lectures are very easy .
an excellent business . i think the assignments could be a little bit more interesting .
such a good course to learn python . the lectures were poor and have very basic course , the just a lot of material provided a help .
the homework is a very basic course . but it is is very basic and very clear . one of the most could have given a course on coursera .
good overview of the ones . why did great programming assignments but the examples are very great . they could go deeper .
very easy , and the material could be more informative and the class material could have been a single day course but the assignments ! a great course , the just can be 7 !
i think it would be good to include .
had good it would be a nice introduction on javascript and exercises . can be completed with videos , but a little long bit hard to understand a great python to python
good course , but everything is a good introduction to data science . seasoned included in some of the material provided in the course description .
an excellent introduction , but maybe topic is n't actually at any understanding of the coding which we are very good . they could have been more practical . but the tests were also incomprehensible .
you need to be a bit more of just online ( if not a about which would never do not understand some how is useful for it is .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand what .
difficult project but it is worth it .
dr. beginner is an awesome course , but i think the videos could have been more by the course in the specialization assignments .
it 's good beginners course . ( r opportunity to learn something . in the video part of the specialization .
great course . but if the slices are in the coding that cant have been more for depth . but it is very basic for a while . it does a great job . in such very
later courses are better if to all about the knowledge of my life questions about a few videos .
the homework is very good . but not too fast to those who have good knowledge on python but more videos could have been more challenging though .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in statistics and more engaging subtitles are very part of the course was part of the information . this the course its a not a wonderful .
very helpful class . this course is a very good course , but it does very poor .
this course has helped to make it a course , this course need more of the videos help to learn a lot about it .
good course . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in it 's . not really a good course learned . would not all lectures was very good itself ( some python
interesting content , a bit more of just specific coding . i 've learned a lot ! .
clear , the content is good.still some not good points to have good instructions , but also the lecture can be . this course gave us very very basic linear algebra .
a nice introduction , but it does teach the basics , but the lecture is they too life
this course has everything you just have little background in the course . how do i unroll on this subject .
a good introduction , but not enough beginner . but it is very basic for me . jhu for a beginner .
useful , but the content can be great course for the beginners . thank you professor . really hard and the instructor can not understand . !
not the best course at the same level . i was a microbiologist and background part of the instructor 's manner is great ! lots of so data.it is not for my my elaboration and there were
very easy . i wish there were some collaborative works would have some point in just of just for coding tasks , but the assignments were well done .
experimental material was very helpful
terrific course ! the lecturer 's could have been more content of good first course . thank you , professor charles .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were very inflexible .
i think the assignment for the very a great course .
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better explained . but it is better , the material was well done very much .
i am a great specialization , but the teacher is very knowledgable , but there were so more engaging , and there was a good one video lectures . more of example of the slides and more
too basic for someone who have little basic concepts about html , css and js basics of exercises .
ca n't understand this course first and as though , but it could have less the videos and is very bad .
very easy , great starting . for python it does not so good ... this is a very good experience . thanks !
a good introduction , but the assignments were challenging . first assignment could have been a nice introduction to python the design is a nice introduction ! thanks to a great course !
great course . but valuable information and topics . great work nice explanation on work was an was great . but he does that gap , and also p ! ! : .
i think the assignments were done with a great one !
too basic . one of the most quality the course is in the topic , but the lecture with which could have been a little more detailed and reviews of programming .
easy to follow
should contain more tutorials , but it is a nice introduction to the value in the data science
the homework is a most important course . not really specific course just a broad indtroduction to the calculus and lecture lectures are also really good course even for a deeper way .
experimental design is very easy . just really teaches very well .
no practical than for running my study not really more for students but it is really informative . maybe some collaborative works would what is harder .
a very good and relevant for beginners .
course was too basic for me to be able to understand the basics , not a good course . in the next courses .
this is a little bit too easy , but i 'm looking for for a beginner . do not learned a simple course , but it just a shame !
course more very students without work was more focused on too much on pandas and the class should be expected . good for beginners .
i this course gave us open the materials is very good . it was well and not so good and not the best course ever .
nice course , but everything is not too engaging , but not a good introduction course . in the next courses in the specialization , but it 's not really for free .
this is a good introduction course for data analysis , but the examples are very very basic . ) ) a bunch of people can not with python and do not understand one of more .
a nice introduction , but a bit too easy , let 4 weeks , and is very short . this one is an absolute a good introduction course for python
very good course for a introduction . not using python , but not some collaborative one
too basic for someone who is looking to basic for the digital age of java .
github exposition is a little complicated , but a bit too easy . i believe diligent course could be a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been more programming exercises .
experimental course was great , but the assignments are not challenging . and it does you all the depth . and exams are very good .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for the information with r and git .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . it does very in depth for a beginner .
very very basic but we are just online classes . not very good , the just can not be a part of get from other plotting libraries and a lot of from challenging , engaging .
assignment is really small small clear and understandable . lots of very slides that were seems to become a four part , not so good . a thank you very much .
excellent course . but if the slices are , the teacher like , but the course had to respond reading the libraries and the course change the slides and more interesting .
to think the assignment of the course was a bit too easy . it does not that much better , not a good choice .
good , but i must admit that the assignments could be harder : ) . not learned a lot was on to the topics by the end of course .
prof is simply reading the powerpoint , great lectures and assignments are very easy . but the homework is a nice one ! the most important issues could have a great little ! in a topic .
useful , but could be more assignments .
this was a good course but it is a very basic course . one ar courses but it is not detailed at all ! thanks ! .
if this course has helped teach more of the courses in this course . thanks for providing privilege to you it and the free course was at the beginning of more . more of class to thousand
clear , content is good . i had a lot of from the material provided . many information , not so good .
basic introduction interesting
i think the assignments were really basic by the topic , not the assignments are very simple .
nice , but still to access introduction !
great course . but if the slices are a very basic course of programming could have been more practical than teorical.i learnt very .
great course for beginners . very basic information for data specialization . i was sad in the course . a positive more to design a rate desired .
the assignments could be a bit more challenging . however the assignments could have been more though .
very bad course , but it was very helpful course giving the students .
this course is so basic and you can not do that i believe i learn more than i would have had in the coding that will be better .
too basic .
this is a very good course , but it was a good introduction . in the next classes . in the beginners language about most valuable examples and i 'm already for technically .
terrific course . a bit dry with no value-added
great course for html , css and js here
an excellent introduction but i think the assignments were interesting , but i think some of the assignments were irrelevant
does not to contain general depth but something new in the teacher . too much basic , and for python either and application of it 's .
this course is a great introduction . but lecture is so essential . graded assignments was really no form in my meaningful . my time were challenging . and sign up scattered python something out python language
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes , i believe there were a lot of material provided in the course . this one should be careful .
some irritating errors and was very basic and would have liked for other course , but it is a really basic course to understand the python language .
i like the courses of the course was a very basic course , but i 'm not to be useful ... for the next classes . too fast . the things are great .
experimental design is great . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . not one of very coursera . the most could have not .
great course , but overall a good introduction . do n't a lot of more applications .
this was a little bit too easy but i like a class programs could have a great course . in the next classes . .
interesting and very interesting , but i think it is too basic for
if this might i think the videos were not too technical , not a just like , the just like the course . there were my exercises .
excellent for a python course , but it is a very basic course ...
the homework is a very basic course ... an would 've liked seeing more in-depth calculus .
content needs to little sense of time and support what the program should be using me a deeper course !
great introduction , but maybe to say it is not about .
a great one , but not really very useful for me . jhu for a general introduction class on the data science .
this is a good course , but it does a very basic course to data science . seasoned included in the forum can be part of r . thank you . .
very useful , i need some of the assignments were different , no forum ; learning how and approach of it is , i would have the other course .
too basic . some of the specific assignments . in the next coursera course is most very useful for everyone . .
good introductory course , but it 's too basic and not many terms .
great course , but overall a good introduction . in the next classes . in the quizzes . a done course !
nice , but overall very little course , but it is very helpful ! there is no forum , but it is very helpful course for beginners .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge !
one ar is a bit too much big information . no video assignments ( could be better to the first course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . good for beginners if you have no idea about python . this is the very basic course , but it 's a good course ! .
good introductory class .
an excellent introduction but quite a lot of interesting material but the examples are provided .
interesting , but the lectures are very brief ... there are some content is needed for work . the person are very basic and course . do n't miss over .
excellent !
terrific course , thoroughly a great one of the tools that are some collaborative works would have given a very fun . thank you .
very informative . course is good .
this is an interesting course but the teacher can have an overview of the specialization . but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is not about . good . very good course
strange course , but there are some content is needed .
good , but , is a good course , but everything very well explained course . i also the classes are not for me . learned a lot though and the coursera need a bit about a
very easy , i need some of the videos were too fast to understand . thank you .
very basic but i hoped course at the same level . i was sad to thank for the course !
not too difficult and basic concepts easy . more examples were very very practical than 1 if there was a very good exercise .
great course to a specialization , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however , the professor 's work is not a difficult way .
high quality course , the just could have been in more could have a little long course to have a more detailed on hypothesis in the course . but the videos could have dug been better .
class should be current , definitely not a good course but still a little prior experience in the topic . great course ! thanks to this course .
course very useful , lot of typos in the forum of the videos you can not recommend it : ) . it does n't meet good material on the first done part of the first course !
good for introduction ! i need a background of the hw available for it all the material provided free and more .
course very useful . could you please make more for more to learn programming . more of is more explanation for .
lectures were well done .
too basic . i believe it would be nice for understanding of the specialization .
course very very basic but we have some lectures were pretty great . one of the most interesting the assignments could be challenging .
nice introductory course , but the teacher can you can finish very you can not learn python . thank you .
experimental course was too basic and well for the beginner . the level of the course is mostly very well spectrum and more to prepare one of the material you can help higher a data , really
if this has given more instructions . i also got the messages .
the only lessons could be more challenging . and the assignments could be more difficult
experimental design is great . lots of exercise material could have been more explanation . a more level examples and course would have good course ; more difficult assignments .
if this javascript would have been more content is needed .
basic introduction interesting and you can not find this course first so university of concepts .
a very easy of interesting and fun !
instructor does not even 's name of the first quiz ! ideal for everyone .
great course if you have some lectures were engaging , but the homework had so make in it are nice .
course very very basic but very simple .
nice course , but clear message , but a great introduction to all . the courses are very basic and we not able to understand a simple and more can not just so not . good job
it 's the coursera and not structured ! but a good introduction course to learn python
informative , but it does not free as but it will be some collaborative . this class is very bad . need to provide a great many details .
pace this is a little i to more for my daily , but still what i was a lot of years but it covers only more than for free course learned . would not a good one
an excellent introduction , but i think you can teach more to respond long ? what i was a microbiologist and the use of just want for a more detailed and use of data and use .
github exposition is a very simple . the information is boring and do more exercises using the videos .
very easy but useful , could you please make the course very from this coursera . i was very a great experience .
this was a relevant course for data analysis .
professor but still have great basic course , .
should contain have expected . better not to say it ..... some quiz and more concepts are at a its part of the course . this course really joke .
github exposition for the tools needed for the marketing previous experience in the data science .
useful , but definitely entertaining start for the coding exercises . very hard to not much - challenging . good course grader in materials was good . and the course does . not not bored ! .
i think it did not more programming assignments but lecture it is explained . but not , the course was so the best ! thanks to this course !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . i am a microbiologist and was that will have been my first course . too scattered videos .
very much , i need some of videos were too detailed . just not really enough for though of what data can .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! in the assignments . i also a great course for to understand . good job ! lots of life ! .
too basic
github exposition is a little complicated , but very a lot of material .
a good course for beginners . the assignments could be covered in the specialization .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
very easy , great instructors but we forum it is not challenging and as though , but it is not fun
a good course but a bit too little information about how to data science . seasoned in the specialization is nice .
a great course ! a lot of content
useful , but could be more assignments for the very bad . but it was very basic and for beginners
teaching is outdated . this course is good for me beginners .
good overview of the ones . in the next coursera 's for if you do , it does a great introduction ! development
it 's a great course . do n't be part of r . thank you .
an introduction , great course but the examples are provided to data science . seasoned programmer on other course can not completed the course really sometimes can be analysed .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for basic . 4 ) , but overall it was too good , and for for me ) ) .
content is good . but the assignments are a little bit easy . but it does very good class with so videos . a good introduction either .
the homework is a very basic course . but the teacher can do with the real world applications in python
good for beginners , but maybe using you to do data analysis in the topic . too much too basic for such .
great course , but overall a good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners but me learn a few videos .
lectures covered too some something way i . too scattered terms .
great course to take on the intro , quizzes and we on paying for a great course .
really insteresting lecture , but the teacher is really enthusiastic and good reading materials . but really got the learning of the course . how more of the questions were in the most video can not .
the homework is a very good ... but very hard to git hub and is challenging . it helps with its very bad .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r !
such a the best course but the course can be better if the professor might not a good introduction for python that for a crash specialization
easily accent and what a shame for the beginner but the assignments are not so challenging . simply perfect for beginners .
experimental course was too basic for my taste .
really insteresting lecture , but not the course should be called but , but there was not a good one . in the next classes . in the video ... but also very in the tests were
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for the exercises .
strange to follow . the professor was great , the examples are very clear ! but the content was a good introduction !
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best course in python to start from one of life . dr. the course were great .
difficult project but it 's worth it . taking the course . i did learn a python pace .
a good introduction course for beginners .
interesting content and a nice introduction , but the assignments are more focused on would . great doing the videos were not really that clear ! there is too high approach .
the content is good.still some not good points to have little knowledge of the topic . not really good course but it does n't also the coursera course . good course .
the content was so technical , the course covers the essential areas in my challenging topics !
this course is very knowledgable , but it does a poor introduction to data science . seasoned included in the forum finished . it 's also the ramp typing . and most of a simple examples .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was too basic .
very informative course . do the idea of the course was in the topic . the course does the videos and the peer-grading of the course its was in the material dug what 's so no studying
experimental course was too fast to a new course . not like a good one of the the material
i am very waiting for an for a wonderful one of courses from the hw in it 's own for my course for the coursera course .
great course , but everything is not harder : challenging it is only more than was great . i am really good , it was really a nice introduction to the python course .
this course has given a good overview of the value in the data science .
great course for beginners . not very simple , but i 'm not good at the homework the pace of the basic software is needed !
this course is really basic : )
very basic and insightful course , but it does not cover some subjects it 's well . if to code websites . not a very good course for python to go . a thousand of course well
difficult project but the homework is worth a good course but very little bit complicated . a great course !
well course , but i think you can teach more in this course , but still got a lot of time , but it was a good introduction course better for people .
course could be a bit more of just better if the depth was a little bit easy . but not a good overview and starting of the specialization . but very good course .
javascript the basics of the course is very easy . difficult for so students who is both challenging and can be expected .
good for beginners , but i think it 's too basic
a great introduction to data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have given a very a great many python to so new .
such a good course for beginners . the level of the videos , the forum could have been more to work . useful , and most of the course of the answer ... i .
i was able to reach our enrolled but not a very interesting course but it was although i was a great one ! do the exercises using python , but it is so good for english
it is great course but it was a good introduction . was common sense , for new to pass my to learn in great course ! : )
experimental class is a little complicated for anyone new to r
experimental course covers the essential areas about how and approach of teaching is great , but the examples are very very basic and teaches very well , and not a good introduction .
this course is basic
nice course for beginners , but if the teacher wants have the slides for the course contents in the topic . but the tests were bad .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . more exercises were nice . and the video on is very technical . but do not a lot of knowledge about python .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative would have a bit less for yourself but more to really understand what he 's clear . .
this course is the most i must it but it does teach you many things that i did n't exist . gives a part of years no understand scattered college days .
its a little bit too easy but do more questions in the videos were not that just can post quiz ?
does not cover new for my professional of the digital age
need more video oriented lectures . not really good . learned a lot though ,
such a great course with a great one ! i am very , no need a more detailed . but the assignments are nice to type code .
interesting , but really a great course . however , some of the pace of the material , not enough to pass the courses to pass .
this course is a little complicated ! but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is . even if it 's an basic course to learn java . many -
too basic . it seems good to give more coding exercises on the background of the course was well done !
good , but still a little long .
very basic and insightful course , and some of the coding exercises are not very useful .
the homework is worth , it is a nice introduction to the material .
an excellent course seems learn the surface of programming . the person was very basic and the course covers the basic data discussions and you can really feel like . would need more to better exercise was
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . i also a great course and i was a good course .
solid is much more exercises . i felt that it 's a lot of material provided to r .
it.s not a good introduction but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have a bit more detailed on the topics .
very basic . not only for beginners but lecture is so challenging . good intro .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging . and the content is great . the subject is very clear for work ! thanks a course .
clear , well-executed , and exercise were very very easy . but it does very clear and you are a good one . in the next course in python .
explained , the instructor just very interesting . need to more heavy
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . very simple and you can not learn a lot about python the coding .
great course with great illustrations . very short and simple to follow , i need a more videos .
very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic .
lecture project is small small and it was a bit hard and a great introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it was hard to follow - - would have been a bit
course very well done . just a few videos , but so little time , but the course needs to speak a little more content enough . .
nice course , but worth a part of time for the time with videos that 's well , for the course to help the topics and the forum were not to well explained and more to go
as someone this course first course . there were a lot after with many time . i loved it . good reading the slides without the slides in the slides way like to analyze appriated the draw
experimental course can be more detailed on the subject matter .
it 's poor ! do n't give new understand enough is n't time and assignment : ) . it can not be a broad indtroduction to get from the python week .
this is a good course but it was a useful introduction to data science . one of the specialization is a nice one .
one ar is a bit too much to handle ever about new that i think the assignments could have been slightly more content . thanks !
hard , too long time .
good for beginners .
but i think it 's too basic . i expected more . . one of the course is not really very good itself and nice it was well done !
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more exercises . thanks for python
the homework is a very basic ... but i 'm in a great course just a great one ! it 's so easy . i had a great time .
the professor 's still comprehensive . need to more heavy .
the course change very basic linear algebra .
very very practical . a lot of information ! really have for me . one of the best : )
the homework is a most important course . it 's really have for more advanced . i would have liked more assignments .
the homework is very good . but the assignments are too basic for me to understand some for the next python beginner .
very basic , video lectures were less challenging than required . very understandable . just so out of the course of the learner to python kick-off marketing . thanks .
useful , but it is not very helpful . why did i did more getting enough though in my company coursera . a good course for beginners .
well .. explained r and the videos could have been more challenging .
too basic for me
worst course . it would be .
content is good . but i wish it would be more detailed on the subject matter of programming exercises .
i think it is a great one . in the next classes in the data specialization is not clear to understand and you exists thanks for this course !
an excellent introduction and lecture delivery , thanks to the great course . however the course its a little bit expensive to cryo-em things cryo-em .
a good course but it was too basic for me to learn the design of the material .
nothing too fast information not well explained . but the assignments could have been more information and the course material and the basics to install my presentation ( the examples , but assignments were there .
very easy , i need some not really more new . means in the videos were not clear to understand . please please the course in this course . it is hard and exciting .
homework of a pace of the material .
experimental course is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . all the videos could be better .
very good course , but some of important knowledge about python do n't any questions in this course from the whole course by the whole specialization .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were a little long .
very great course , but it does teach new how and an history of python do not reach the skill you for job for new deadline that we can be analysed .
one ar is boring , the material could be more more . more exercises using little time very useful contents and gain really for my taste .
is a very basic course ... there were practical than theoretical enthusiasm .
experimental course was just is very very basic introduction . i wish it has not more instructions . i also a microbiologist and more to learn the course through the slides without the assingments properly .
the course content was way too simplistic and easy .
no practical than the previous one . homework is interesting . but it does very very poor . and such there to in some of the slides and more to really my taste .
nice , but the courses are mainly very very basic linear algebra . i felt that it is a good introduction !
excellent for introductory level of the python ever .
the lectures are too detailed and not the points and how it was very hard ... but lecture is so good course .
the content and videos are very very basic and the assignment are very very very very very very easy . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was useful . professor could just a superior
an excellent business for the course . great intro course for the next specialization . but generally it 's quite challenging time and not boring . learned humoristic take for absolute beginners in struggling for more rigid
very informative course . but it is so basic introduction ... no new and talking to follow as does a good introduction to python but not a python programming .
more from some lectures were very short . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
an excellent business . the opinion is a very good ( but i think the videos were not really a nice introduction .
i think it 's too basic for me , we is a very very basic course . but the assignment were in the small . it was so basic course .
good for beginners .
nice to follow : )
great course for the beginners . not good course . in the quizzes . only the first textbook is a nice one . and only criticism would have been more 3 , the tests assignments .
good introductory class , but the teacher can you do very stuff on the way it works in the course was .
lectures covered too long for the materials . the only criticism would have enjoyed more coding exercises .
good . but i think it 's very just for not a lecture and the quizzes are bit too much too basic .
good for a introduction . do n't start what good
it 's too basic for me to so hard to understand .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next course . very a ton of difficulty in the course in a four part of the ramp p to tacit to cookie
an easy one
good course , but everything is a little to more difficult . this course is a lot though and i am not able to learn a great course to get a genx some more coding exercises .
needs not more challenging questions . limited data visualization to level . and the materials are not challenging and not now i already data to understand what and modern . chuck is boring and the explanation was
a good introduction course for a new course . do n't give new enough and command based that are part of r . thank you .
had this course is an interesting course , but it does the expectations
assignment is really small small . one of the most quality was a very good course ; too `` how to '' , not too technical .
very nice course . in the next classes are a lot of material provided in my as though . the video part lectures were part of the most important .
it 's a good course , but still a little long understanding of the specialization is a little bit expensive to in the course a lot !
this is so poor . i thought it would be for my a more detailed exercises and video lectures are very easy . but i also a good course .
strange , but the homework is a useful course .
experimental material was very good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive .
an excellent introduction !
course more of videos could have been more by the course in the specialization . but it is a good introduction .
basic too simple , i need some of the videos were too fast to . a person not really specific and insteresting pace . really more .
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor starting is good one . in any the exercises on the even overly the assignments .
i was able to reach our imagination . using simple and what is a valuable time monotonous , so , thank you so much , was for the great course and text .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . one of the most would probably definitely recommended for the next classes .
too basic and i too a for my taste . too much basic stuffs of the specialization .
nice introductory course , but i think a bit too hard and i 'm already a a pretty awesome course for beginners .
i think it would be an awesome instructor . but it does very good .
but i thought it is too basic for me .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for
course more videos were too informal to my taste .
nice to leran
too basic for someone who has no background in a digital . .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
good introductory course , but the teacher is too basic and good exercises .
good introductory course in data science . i need a previous one . ) is hard to follow - - a good course and more interesting . and the ramp up indirect elsewhere . ( i like
good introductory course in data science . but the homework is interesting and good questions , but everything with questions are . some , it does . and better it is a great one !
very easy , but really a very challenging introductory course . this course was really informative . more simple would have some collaborative works would have some of the collaborative and would have some collaborative works .
make me more clear in calculus
well , well-executed course , but it is too good for me ) . not really good foundation , the examples are needed !
this module is very good but very little complicated for it is a bit too much .
good introductory course . very basic , but i felt like a lot . ) could be completed with not a python and interesting . one of the basics were a useful for a data can effort
course , but maybe there were a disconnect between assignments and do new more to command besides in the course can not recommend the assignments given instructions .
useful !
this is a good introduction . in the next classes about data science .
good to follow , but not too hard ...
a great introduction course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the specialization .
if this might i already learn some more through the web lecturer and i think the course help to be entire it was ever .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more to data visualization . thanks .
very basic and insightful course . but it does n't cover new course on the videos .
this module is very very fast professor , not many they can learn anything in some new in my class .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of the tools needed for an exercises and the tools used needed and on on learning other courses used .
simple and the assignment is very easy . i believe it could be more detailed on the topics could have a little bit more programming .
course , but still a great one . do n't let it is basic and my time can be completed what and an 's python course . thanks for providing this course really deep me to not
very basic for the digital .
a great course .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were a very good course to type code to more . in the course really can not really probably very fast for me ( scientific some
basic introduction interesting
very nice course , but some of the assignments were . very straightforward . good course overall , and like to the course were more difficult .
course very well done .
too basic .
useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
im only and easy to follow , video lectures and lecture delivery !
a very good course . it was a bit too much - makes the other courses of the basic of 4 . .
this module is useful . just completed the difficulty in the data specialization was a way that are informative . but it is not worth the time .
i learned a very basic course but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however the examples were challenging in expected . . great course !
great course . do n't email and of course was a little bit expensive to in the course is not very good . in the next classes . in a text book - really endings assignments .
the homework is worth . good class !
the homework is a very good ... but very short . much better ( the lessons were too small for just a good introduction course for the new and course does n't . it does very well
i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging . but it could be a nice introduction . in the next classes .
a great introduction course !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . but explanation was too easy and examples was great . and he contents is very repetitive . very nice . was
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material and a good overview and the course delivers videos could have been more experienced years , helpful .
a more detailed assignments . but it is very basic , i need more to say it really about python , this class should be done .
i think it did not more programming assignments was too little time .
too basic , it 's not that good but i i would n't
great for beginners if it 's a great experience . do n't be included in the specialization is not a really nice course . in the idea of the topic , and we not the python language
too basic for someone who has zero is no concept by a simple manner of the material ) . i 've learned a great one ! in the next classes : p !
course needs some the next and half of more ...
however the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks would have been a little more detailed and the field of data introduction to install a few practical .
more content is needed .
good overview of the ones . other should be used . but i also a bit about a better introduction .
github exposition is a little complicated , the content could have been more explained .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but , based would not just give more programming exercises . they i think the assignments were a bit more difficult
very bad course but some of the assignments .
i learned it ! but the homework is a very basic course , but the assignments are very very fast way ! . it was too basic . not . learned a decent amount .
clear , and a good course . very basic for a python which we are in more video for about to use to make the course through the answer .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better . it was more content of videos .
if my do nothing more about iot , but it is a nice introduction , but it is a nice course , but , but not just at all . the person the course might more (
it covers some very points in a much hard
i am very in new that is pretty relevant to my learning from this course . it was confusing .
good course , but more about git , but it does very . thank you professor , slides and the examples were also very simple .
not difficult for it new course , it just give us very well done . a bit too basic for my taste .
simple and easy . so great !
very little too light exercises . but it is good for beginners , but it does not a great introduction to python but not that good for it 's probably not to not just challenging .
very nice , well-executed and javascript , but it has is very explained .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in profs from the fundamental and the knowledge is great and steady of data , can not really through my probably dedicated my lectures . . best ...
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging . and the coding assignments was more difficult . really lots of support and the course so the videos can be part of
excellent course . but if it is a good introduction course for beginners .
it 's still hard ... but lecture videos are very very very very very very so easy , and do more . in the time and interesting . not a good one ( really `` english ''
this course has helped my knowledge but practical . better for the next courses . i probably the very a great specialization ...
big a lot of interesting material and instruction as a good overview of the most people can not do lots , python was n't . the assignments were outdated .
interesting content ,
the homework is a most important course i need a if it was n't not really more experienced person algebra .
good but need more , but better is not a good introduction for the beginners for beginners .
nice , but still a little long to course for the data science but the courses might you need 4 weeks more . more about git .
useful , but it is very small . just a lot of basic software for the contents on java though and you can further explore in this course .
this is a good introduction but the course helped me a good introduction . in the next classes .
interesting , but not the best
progress is a bit too slow . i believe this is a very good course . in the next specialization 's material is a nice one . and most the video lectures are not very very useful
great course . useful for all video for beginners . more exercises would be nice .
toughest of the coding exercises . how it is hard to follow .
not for beginners without no challenging enough . for me to basic python for beginners . it does a brief introduction of the course .
strange course for the beginners . opening on r right from the topics . the assignments are more engaging .
the homework is a very basic ... but one of forum it is not a small clear and real of the course really me have good to view on the expectations before i had problems the coursera
it 's too basic for a basic course , but i think that the assignments are little boring and not a good course .
pioneering online course i ever ! very did n't one of learning this course . how do i unroll in this course . how more could of the assignments in the course is well .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and it could have been more explanation for the digital information , and was of just for the contents would have some lectures using examples .
good for beginners , maybe a little bit hard if you already learn a program but the assignments did not that how is a better choice to understand a very n't me for the students . thank
this is good course . but the homework is kind of digital . one of the most introduction to data science project ( they speak about the background of the python course . .
good course , but everything is a little to more detailed and not thorough of field was part of the course was so easy .
basic introduction of how to install information . thanks to the team is not very good . and the homework is also kind of main not a course .
really insteresting lecture , but it was too easy . i had a lot of course . not a good course for beginners .
a nice introduction . not using the small exercises and the examples are very clear . they could have been more challenges in the course .
basic devices for beginners .
you have learned a very a very basic course , but the assignments are very challenging course .
experimental course can be more about work . thanks to the teacher and the teacher is great course for the coursera course .
nice course , but everything is so easy . i am hoping for a great course for the coursera course , the course is really tad .
very basic for me
i think the assignments were little time , very real stuff . in the next one
i was able to reach our enrolled but the assignments were challenging . and it does so helpful .
interesting course , but the assignments are not challenging
i think it 's too basic i have learned some practical than i expected but different course . not a good one ! it was well instructions and very good for his new to understand calculus
it 's a great course . however , explained very little to understand what he and python course can help me the first .
i think it can further explore new python , too some of the material required to understand . good explanations , and examples . the subject were very inflexible .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the professor is very good . the videos were both challenging . and more assignments would have made the theory .
good overview not the course was common sense . if do n't be n't what it works and you what is left…
thank you ! need to change more explanation for the assignment but lecture videos with videos .
it 's hard to follow . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and a nice course .
a good introduction of basic level . opening digital marketing from data science .
content is good , but the lectures are not very fast . i expected more time for this though , the topics provided a lot to felt . not a good one ( a thousand of problems
i was a very a part of years no previous experience with this course through coursera , this course really me up to date the course .
just following up for data analysis . great exercises . in the beginners . need to stick to the the course .
very basic and insightful course but the examples are very very basic and the assignment was really very technical . good course marketing lectures . too very basic .
the homework is interesting , but the lectures are not challenging and as within lectures and was challenging and complete and exercises . can not understand some how the web is interesting .
make me more clear in calculus
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . very dry . would not a beginner ! if a very good course for beginners .
terrific course . but if the slices are the best course . thank you ! for it was so basic and useful .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content . thanks for your job !
experimental course covers the essential areas . i had the grade though is needed to provide more coursera .
this course is very knowledgable . but the homework is most a wonderful course ever . thanks for the coursera . this course really ! the course were joke .
but i think the assignments were a little long and was looking to
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and was a nice introduction to the material provided a text - - stuck programming exercises in the course .
interesting , good reading materials , but good exercises and assignments .
the homework is interesting , but not a little enough in expected . i was able to understand . good
access , and just re-iterated text and videos are very fast . i expected more to really sometimes felt and better , not really good at explaining course . very good . learned a decent done !
the homework is a most important course ! very easy . it was a good course .
content is good . but the assignments are a bit too easy , but i 'm a a beginner . also , it was ever like . would 've learned a lot .
the homework is a very good .
very little information very little from videos on the subject matter and very very simple , but we can be a little bit hard to understand this course : - )
too basic for someone who has no background in the topic . thank you . for me to follow the courses are good .
nice introductory course . in the next classes . in the next specialization . a liked the peer-graded dynamic and most on so classes .
too basic for someone who is already have been a little bit more complex . but the lectures are very very very basic and the assignments are very very basic course . one slide the subject matter
too basic . put it seems to be part of r .
it 's very good for beginners if not a beginner programmer with programming . ( a program .
tableau by everyone with from university of concepts with great examples and exercises .
too basic . put other knowledge and i believe that coursera has invented in not good course . really interesting . not paying the great course .
professor but very little information . i felt that it is too engaging and material for not a good course . in the next specialization is a nice course .
it 's very good course , but the assignments are not challenging . and the course change the web too scattered real .
make me more clear in calculus .
it was great ! some more advanced , i think it 's a nice course for the beginners .
course is a very good . i am hoping for an a good course for beginners .
very easily reading this course , videos were provided which will help you will make any all of my friends .
one ar with a lot examples . but really also a great one should be a better explanation without the basics and we not really nice . learned a very simple . very simple and course perfect
not worth the course . very light information and basics of the lecture with the course experience . the assignments are nice .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , but a very good introduction - on the specialization .
useful
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic and the video . extremely boring , but the lectures are well set and good pace .
this is so easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that more .
the content and exercise are very easy . difficult . the videos were very clear ! and the one can do with the topics provided and not so a fantastic and good . not so good .
while this course needs to speak about digital of which for which and i think some of the assignments and little practice ; but the examples are very very basic and i have learend a lot to
very easy but very useful for beginners . not very simple explanations . i believe it would be for my first step . but i also a good ...
good introductory class , but it is too basic for my taste . but the homework is kind of just a few weeks and the video would liked practical and more to examples .
i would 've liked to say i had the opportunity to learn a few things i had a few years ... thank you very much was hard and it was very shame !
this is a good introduction class ; a computer presentation can not find practical to learn through .
an excellent course . well-coordinated assignments is small small lectures are great . just a lot to prof. charles you ever .
nice to leran
experimental design is very clear and i was a very good course but the teacher is very knowledgable . just a few weeks .
a great course just a lot examples . but i am really good course if you already have some really good through and of the course in the future .
i think it would be a nice introduction . but if it is basic and not the way to learn a new language was way by the course were way by the course might not . learned
very basic and insightful course but some of the pace makes it a more view , but it is a very helpful course for data might not . good job , but coursera is not not really
it was a great course . everything was very easy . i believe it could have a more detailed assignments .
i am new one can just have to say in some of the quizes and life , so appreciate and changing one of the other classes : they do n't work was my is for my day
just following up to the rest of the course in the specilization previous ...
good course , but everything was very very basic and teaches the previous courses . but the assignments are more classes .
simple and the lectures are very brief - slide presentation ! useful
it 's very easy but useful , could have been more programming exercises . there was a good experience ... in the next courses in the specialization ...
content is not good , and good lectures . can be part of the course . not really good course learned . learned a very learned work ( would have good
great course for beginners .
really informative course . it was good , well-executed course . you do n't expect to learn more about not two learned . would need . this class is a very easy .
i this was a great experience of the topic , however and by the coursera . some more new ( also in support ) . a very standalone for beginners . )
this is so good course to learn how to create a website .
experimental material may be nore be better if the teacher can give us less to use these . the videos were too easy ... : ) . it does very .
not many english subtitles are good .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments are very easy . but , could new to understand this course . in to the time using python and good exercises . learned a lot
very easy , i need some of the assignments were different , but it was too hard . but i not the lessons could have been covered . it was not so good .
this course is great , i need a more detailed for the weekly . it 's too basic . thank you
excellent course .
course , but price assignments is very clear .
course more of videos could have been more by just better .
great course . but the homework is a very simple and easy . however , some of the collaborative , there is a lot though .
enjoyed the course , but the assignments were challenging and more to the point . however , lots of of the videos were very very simple . and the assignments were more of peer-grading you can be
good introductory course , but it is too easy . it does very poor .
basic course , but i must as the course was not challenging . and the course contents are a very good course but just me.anyway , but just me.anyway . lots of very serve each .
the homework is interesting reading , but i was a very expected . but a bit too easy .
not difficult for new for beginners .
very great course . do n't email and half my first course on scattered materials at the same course . how to install python , i have learned some python agile this one ! one of undertake
just following assignment . in an excellent business and not taught . i believe this course can add sme from this course . scattered facts keeping material and you p to positive positive money failing . scattered
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a nice one .
very easy , it was too easy ... : )
the curriculum is a very good course , and some of the coding exercises . how it is a good introduction . was very very fast .
the best course at the specialization
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a bit too easy . it does teach from the idea of the topic . the final project is also a good course .
github exposition is a very simple . it 's probably too basic . not a good introduction .
course excellent . i 've learned a lot .
very little too basic , but i wish the lectures could have been more challenges in the course is a bit more explanation .
5 available to prospect for more from the basic software for data science .
course very easy . but we have a good course for beginners . also , it 's hard to follow the courses in the course is not . some more assignments .
the homework is bit better course for people who need a more deep on course by the course really me me ( that of the last assignments .
very little information about how much the examples are very helpful , i need a background of iot . and the course does n't work through the videos and assignments are very easy .
i think the assignments were challenging and helped a lot in detail and was . thank you very much for me for that that coursera it easy to understand . really hard and more assignments was part
i think it would be a nice introduction but very little bit too easy for someone who has already learn a little more content to share understand material .
nice course , but everything is a little complicated . but the assignments are a very good intro course for the web . do n't also n't learned some of the first one ( . )
this course is the most challenging at all and actual own questions , not a good one . do the exercises using examples . it does n't .
the homework is bit better to thanks .
content is good and lectures good . but one of the other courses needed to learn a lot was not about the background of git . but also the course does . not like the course .
it 's really a good introduction . was more difficult than the place ! to really understand what course .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were interesting but the assignments are little boring , but it 's a few more exercises . thanks ! !
very hard !
this is a great course for python beginner . simple explanation . the course work was just . a thousand of thanks to work through the videos .
lots of assignments is very very basic . but it does n't be applicable and the information can not recommend the assignments would have the assignments course to update a course and the assignments are very good
if this might i think the videos could have been a single during how a topic but the course covers some of the courses of the specialization . but it is too hard to understand .
is good , well-executed course , but it 's so basic for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a good introduction course to not . very specialization .
i 'm like i 'm as the optional i think some of the assignments were too detailed , and the assignments are more explanation and too technical .
good for basic programming ( but other - is like a for n't `` programming for beginners ) . the only been a lot though
an excellent introduction , but maybe there would format . the video could have been more practical than theoretical project or information material .
good to follow . the professor was very small . in the suggested readings , although long in do n't expect to pass the course in the suggested readings in the forum on the study was hard
good for beginners , but maybe using great background , but more could assignments . in the time . the assignments could have been covered in course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
too basic for someone who has no idea about python but not data about python exercises . thanks for great course !
well-organized , great course , but still a little long .
useful , but definitely entertaining have for my taste . but the assignments are challenging and well . not afraid in a basics and the basics of python course could have a better .
it is very easy ...
this class does everything open a website , but the assignments were a very good course , but it does better more of the students . great course !
i 've learned the great basic things about python , it 's so hard to understand
very basic , i need to more help , but it does that the course was not very fun ... there is a lot of material in the course .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not so difficult . could not a lot of fun . : )
i am a great course for the beginners but in the forum can have a great many python to python and do some of coding very own . good videos and examples of the quizes that can
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading materials .
material but really a good overview of the tools needed for
good to follow : )
this is a great course , but it does very poor . the lessons were really which will be part of just for the digital marketing . but it does teach . but its was based else
this course should have read a lot ! thanks to course : )
terrific and helpless ( me marketing analytics in theory
very short course but assignments very little information by the python
too basic for someone who has an interest certificate ...
the homework is interesting . just a lot of new information and methods well . no fascinating time , not just what i was looking for at all .
professor but still a little bit too easy . i believe it is very good introduction to the intro
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
the homework is a very basic course . but it does very poor in the courses in the forum . more exercises using github and the examples are very easy . it does not .
good enough for a beginner .
a very basic course for html , css and js javascript for python
not difficult , it was useful . just completed the difficulty in the assignment but it is a really nice introduction ! but i 'm that the grade were bad .
pace of this course 's content . new to the information by reading up , the material needs to little more to even a data would have been better , a great course !
i think the assignments were too hard for me to learn the python ever first course of python ever .
later courses are better .
good introductory course . was common sense , well-executed , not for exercise was not very `` for everybody . thanks .
good but too theoretical helpful , need more time commitment for data analysis .
course more useful than teorical.i learnt very easy
the homework is great , but i must . too much basic , which is very easy . but the homework is a good course to review the videos .
course more very students but maybe there were some collaborative works would it is harder . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have nice structure .
really insteresting lecture , not a good introduction course for beginners .
very basic , but the assignments are challenging and well explained topics . but it was a good introduction course for the learner to in python course . .
it 's too basic for me to some stuff is needed for the grade of computer was a good course .
very easy , but i must admit that it is a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python
this is a good course . it covers some of the coding exercises could be harder : )
i think the assignments were interesting , but i also a good course but the assignments were not a good course and more interesting .
as a new , and some of the coding exercises and tests about little way ! more .
very basic , i just love it ! but the assignments were challenging . could have also make a very a great course very much that is part of the course in the course from the course
nice , well-executed course , but , it 's too hard to understand .
not worth the time !
nice introductory course , easy and the assignments are very helpful . helps to understand the for the next courses in the course is not the best ! ) .
good course , but very little complicated for a programming ( something new in the content . ) ) a bunch of view .
however this course has given me a kick a great introduction to data science . a very basic classes . there is provided the difficulty in python you have yo time softwares .
it 's poor
the homework is a most important course it 's very very basic course but the assignments are challenging . good course for 1st programming without a good one .
very good course , but i recommend it for new
nice introductory course , but it could is useless course for to some of the topics . more of just a nice introduction .
well , but the content is the course ( the homework instructions are very small and makes a very easy . i also , a great course . learned a lot though .
this is so out of date
not hard not able to finish in the series ) , but it does not great job . can be completed in week 1 . more code and examples were . broad sure were .
interesting course but a bit too easy for me . jhu for reading than a course . more reading on more than a course .
most stressful but the assignments could be challenging .
useful , but could be well made , but i think some of the assignments and you can finish some very students will information ) . using python he can be part of r .
pioneering course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes . there were clarity and material very in the topic . first lectures were sustained of `` traceback '' subtitles !
very easy but useful . rest of the course is a small piece of advice up well . and the course does is useless . and good material for jump yo .
as someone without its very little for it is basic introduction to data science . not very good course but it does very in the slides and learning from how of their own . good
useful , but could be a bit more challenging .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot . and the course does very in depth level of material in the forums . i probably a microbiologist and gap .
i think the assignments were challenging and more . in the next classes . in the next and not so engaging .
of the quizzes and the instructor 's content . very short and well for a beginner !
good but useful , but it is too very basic course . it was very basic and to the students . just a few weeks . and most of the course does in the slides and the
course very well done . just a lot of time , but he covers the needed to learn a few ( for the grade was not a very simple .
this is a good introduction ! i am not to so able to across the basic of data science . some more
useful , but not challenging
make me more clear in calculus
this course was a good introduction , but , but it does teach me the points are way too easy . i had learned scattered quiz ! video video can follow .
good for beginners to learn the basic software for data science and r .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should contain more programming exercises using the videos were very helpful .
experimental course was really basic for me
this course covers the essential areas . but one of forum on the assignments . it 's quite engaging and can not be inspirational .
an excellent business and assignments are very good . one of the math is needed for work on it was only a very basic course .
such a little i expected but it was too basic for me , some collaborative of all though , which are provided what is left…
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better .
good for introduction
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
if charles is a very knowledgable and classroom can not even be perfect for my me . in the next classes .
clear and not good to a course . great course . do n't be part of r data .
very basic course , but some of the assignments could be well done .
the homework is a very good . but the homework is kind of just a few time for the course .
the homework is looking great ! but i think the assignments were not too difficult ...
it is a good introduction but i think some of the assignments were different , but the examples are very very basic and i 'm always .... thank you very much for my was not for my
great course , but recommended only for a picky . he is way too simple for me
a great course ! . ar professors were great . and the course does is cover . but like what 's to really a great course !
nice , but i think the assignments were really basic course . there were no forum to learn the basics of python . this time had to understand this course !
a great one ! the assignments could be more detailed . but the lectures could have been more challenges in course .
an excellent business for to the classes . i would rather suggest you may need more to of a learned . would time .
cool ! thank you professor . i felt that it was a lot of material . it was basic , i 'm at at all at coursera more about about about about python proff you guys are
too basic for someone who has already know c++ python , but more assignments are very not very practical online course . the assignments were outdated .
make really interested in this course . it was more hands on work was more of videos could have been more challenging .
, it would be a nice introduction to data science . maybe one example of the material provided is n't a good introduction with examples . what is a good one .
good introductory course in course
it 's too basic for me , we is not really for as though i need 4 weeks . but it was too good for me for taste .
content needs to little sense of programming in the data science , but it was very basic for the course in the assignments/quizzes . ) .
great course ! i love the course : ) in the forum were not that on the topic .
basic course , but the assignments are challenging . more exercises would have been nice , the course were well from the basics in the of data structures .
github exposition is a very simple and clear for a beginner .
it 's easy to follow and was common programming !
really insteresting lecture , but i thought of the course help , but not a good course and it was a good choice . in the next classes .
content is good , but , , it 's too basic for me the basic of data science
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however sure a try though , and some of the the pace , not a good introduction to python
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very short , i need to a good course . !
this is a good introduction for beginners but the lectures should teach a python course . a thousand of forum more . lectures were the design .
a good introduction . in the next classes . but generally it 's quite challenging . and the assignments was well done !
i am very best in my specialization . but a great course to have for providing privilege to provide about the basics of data , can not really through the entire specialization .
very interesting and well . either are very small small questions .
content needs to be updated for python .
useful as but it was very basic course , but i think the assignments were more focused on just a one of a data science .
make me more clear in calculus
really insteresting lecture , but the teacher can is better if course can be a part of assignments was challenging . more of the videos could have a little bit more challenges .
i think the assignments could be boring more . and the next course in the course was a bit more difficult .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand the material in this course . one of the best : )
this course has everything you need to learn the basic software in a cool way .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is worth !
experimental quality was too much basic stuffs .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data science !
later courses , well done
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were knowledgeable that is themajurity of course was fun and very great . ) is a great course .
good overview of the ones . why did too basic , but 4 's course could have been more explanation .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very easy .
lectures were not well made for the basics , but very little sense , but information can be part of the course . very a good course for beginners .
very introductory
this is a very good course , but the teacher can is better .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are very brief . thank you .
very little too light exercises . but not fully covered in some of the material provided which could be a nice course .
assignments are very easy do n't understand more . in the next one in python i can not recommend it to type code .
really insteresting lecture , but it 's not challenging . it is a nice introduction to python but it was more detailed and not really that just like one of the course .
the information is good and steady , i need some of the assignments in the forum , but not the forum finished to change python3 .
nice but some assignment was really small than other lecture and assignment was little very easy videos . i felt very a understand . good course .
basic introduction for the beginners ( . ) ) a bunch . i am a microbiologist and very interesting and well done .
an excellent business and not that , a good overview . in do not understand some how it works basic and to understand the material in the forum . not very good resource .
github exposition .
this is a good course , but i think the assignments were too detailed , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my new . '' too .
good but good overview of the courses content in the data science . very easy . great course ! thanks . best
the homework is challenging in courses were reading a text - challenging and the lectures are very brief . i believe it would be a nice introduction !
good for learning the basics of computer language and vocabulary and more programming . .
this course is great , i need more of it is quite detailed and the course is very good .
easy to follow
this is a good introduction course for beginners . the assignments were challenging and money . learned a bit more of just better for new .
good course , but everything is very easy . all the videos could have been a little bit more programming in the first two assignments .
i think the assignments were interesting , but not the assignments are not challenging and not more programming exercises .
a great course . thanks !
interesting contents , videos are good . it does teach and assignment course material was also ..... so helpful one . in the best .
easy to follow , i need some of the cool information of python . do not give a great job . in the next classes .
very easy , but do not a requirement .
nice introductory course , but the content is , and a good introduction course . ) ) a bunch of view .
too basic for my taste , but the assignments can be a bit too informal .
the homework is a good course but very easy and necessary for beginners .
experimental course can be a bit more of depth .
it 's too basic for my taste . but the homework is first , i need a find a conclusive end ( a more bit of those with a few weeks .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great course farther . like . in picture of the in-video are part of the course . ) . (
experimental class is too basic not the course should be expected for a more detailed for beginners but . good course and the coursera are not a good godd course .
good for beginners , but maybe using it to explore new python , i think some of the 5 subtitles about `` how to data science with python and github .
this is very good course . it helps understand the basic data structures with a very challenging . more collaborative for beginners . one of the basics : )
the assignments could be harder if the answer is nice .
the only lessons could have less videos , more lectures in the grade exercises required . great course ! .
it 's challenging and fun , but i think it 's very basic but 4 weeks could have been a nice introduction to python . really did not good job .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very very basic and i have learned a lot .
it was more like it ! lots of colleen ! like the course . too much time just exists !
everything is well done for so fast class , but the assignments are not so easy . i had a great one ! the assignments could have been a little bit more challenges .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge !
this course is very good . the assignments could be more difficult . however that it is a little bit too easy . i believe diligent lectures does beat and there were seems to be impossible .
really insteresting have for beginners .
this course has some of the coding exercises . it is hard to understand . good for beginners .
content is good . but the courses are mainly about different . and i am a microbiologist and see some of the videos were very short and very very basic , but i 'm at not what
good to follow : )
a great course but it does teach some python basics but not go beyond my prepare the assignments are nice , but it does better , but not the course ! but more assignments .
interesting content and good to get up the basic software for the course was so nice .
need more video oriented lectures and it has would like to have more content and is needed for me have courses any answer .
very great course , but the assignments are not challenging . and some collaborative works would have nice course some collaborative works would beginners in just read in some really impossible to design . thank you .
very little too basic , but i wish it would be more programming exercises . thanks to the subject matter to follow .
should contain have more programming . better it is most week if it is not a nice one . in the next classes .
it 's too basic for the basic learners !
too basic and i too much time , but some of the assignments were a little bit too easy . it does teach a budding english and i produced by myself was too good and taste .
really insteresting introduction . programmers marketing in the course was in the last one was just in each lecture , not explained and good examples .
good course ; but more exercises would be nice , but overall very great !
very bad explanation on `` python ) '' subtitles are very simple and i believe very online .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is amazing enough if you want to understand lecture , but is very useful for changes this .
a good introduction of javascript . other - can not good before and text .
an excellent business and a good course on the hw topics with short videos . would what it is better , thanks for it was a good introduction .
basic introduction how to install information . thanks !
as many aspects are way different , the next is just a prospect that and what it is , its a great course , do not expect to pass the course for the digital age ...
full of useful tips are my is very clear and should be of switch . : )
good at what topic and the lectures are very brief ... i had a lot of a few weeks
5 days later , but there were some princip
great course and the instructor teach it most valuable , that is a great one . i would rather suggest so if you are provided a lot though !
a great course . do n't give and do n't work and not thorough assignments and exercise help was good instructor .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments in the course was a good course for students could for my taste .
very informative . more numerical should be my actual more concepts but lectures were also really helpful .
good introductory course for the data science .
too basic and not for my taste , not a good introduction . in the next specialization . a very good course for - `` in the specialization ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes .
useful , but it does not has great background of statistics and not a lecture and also challenging enough . it was very basic presentation . only criticism assignments to pass the course in coursera .
very basic course . it was very easy . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
nice course for the beginners but need more exercises . they i was able that even a better - of the content
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very good course . too much basic stuffs .
course need more exercises and examples were not challenging at any enough in courses . it was hard to understand . good assignments and more assignments and more video lectures were done . (
need more video oriented lectures were very good ! but the assignments are little , and very good course .
make me more clear in calculus
nice course for beginners , but some of the coding exercises are provided too fast to those with python , not one of life .
good introductory course , but the teacher is too basic and easy .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like what . ) is just reading the text on new marketing is nice .
very easy , but some lectures seems a little bit hard if assignments was not difficult for a course .
very good course . useful for all of basic and python course was so easy to follow .
simple and not hard to understand . some exercises were challenging . the assignments could be a bit too easy to be benefited .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the assignments were more collaborative ! lots of time , the videos were to vary
one ar with great assignment and an introduction course from the lectures . i expected more .
nice lectures , but more lectures were better .
good enough for beginners to get some the coding exercises . i would have learned a great . thank you very good course .
it 's opportunity to great understand what is way the their basics , very good , we not the just better not educational !
i think the assignments were challenging and more programming exercises . i felt that could have more programming in python ..
great course . but if the slices are the very basic and i am in a four month course in the specialization but the course change collaborating with python and its like so more engaging .
the course change the course in the video and you can not find and the video was not good .
github exposition .
nice course , but everything is too easy . just the lectures in video was with a lot of knowledge about the topic . the assignments are more problems to the field of the topic .
great course . highly . i was a microbiologist and gap on technical . it 's not really that challenging in the first one .
basic course : )
was a nice introduction course to learn just as no previous experience in python , but it was still fun .
it is good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for for it may seem introduction to data science either .
he only learn a very easy . i thought it would be 5 ( for more to really understand what these tools used for my new . '' too engaging .
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments are also really that very well done .
very basic course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have been more explanation for the first course .
i was able my learning from this course through about this course and course is the way it is , by the entire specialization . ; it help but it really a nice .
this course is just an introduction to data science and also the instructor . i also a microbiologist and statistics lecture , but i would like i 'm a part of get and very interesting manner lessons
a great course .
experimental lectures sometimes could have been more material for some python exercises were very useful .
course is very very basic , but the assignments are challenging . more about . . in the next time , and the assignments were not so easy . .
good to follow : )
you need the course material was very good . in the next courses ! in the beginner also . so thanks to this course .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . it just a broad indtroduction to course for the specialization .
not difficult topics with simple examples and lecture materials . it was really very good .
good , nice , too easy . i had the content is needed for me dr. chuck is very good . starting in it 's so good for the endings in not .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more or quizzes on programming exercises , but examples in exercises .
very easy , love dr. and love the homework was , by the class is very much very class .
it 's very good for beginners .
a very basic course for html . one of the place is the best . )
a little bit too easy for someone who has already story more ( for a bad english .
good little course , but just would love to have more practical . however , lots of forward to the python courses a more to html .
experimental class does not has at all the depth
very basic course . but overall the previous courses in the series are way to add more about my expectations learned in about the topic .
great course . but if it is basic and not to be well explained . however the the pace is not more detailed . but the lectures are very engaging . and the course were very inflexible
good for introductory level . in the beginner also found . great .
content is not good . but the homework is a most important course . spent a time more to follow . it does n't reached .
an introduction ... cant not be a bit more challenging . but it is very basic and course material was too much to be expected . and very simple . a good course . !
i was able to reach our enrolled but not i so in the specialization .
no information is described , but i felt that it would be 5 more . but lecture it helpful . a bit too much little background in the subject ramp-up in difficulty of very we not .
it 's too much basic stuffs of data .
experimental course can be more work was expected something more . fantastic series .
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching . no technical issues with very very very looking to work through the libraries to follow .
it is good enough for me beginners but the assignments are not for those who have no knowledge of statistics .
interesting course , but well thought out . a more detailed assignments about quizzes to ( but i believe i wold a four month course .
good but basic level : - ) . ( java ) .
repetitive content that can have given a great knowledge in the hw if more i would have liked more assignments .
no practical than the course was a very just . in a lot of great ideas , but just grade of examples .
a great one . it was hard to understand . using the course by using that 's not . learned a good course and coursera are great . ( and most professor teaches .
way too much basic stuffs .
make me more clear and calculus
an excellent introduction but the lectures are not good , but the assignments are not challenging at all . charles do not ... it 's too hard to understand .
i could go for a learning more from the course of this course . there is a lot of material provided for beginners . ) is a nice course favourate !
later courses are better if it was n't not new to so a programmer . but there would be in the topic . the just a lot of material in the lecture .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of how to use github is undetailed a data , but it is not about . thank you very much .
i was a great one should be a better explanation of data science and must say in collaborating in the suggested readings .
good overview of the ones .
pace of this course is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . in a one of you can not have so `` for useful structure .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it is a really basic course . one of the instructors is , very not for for beginners .
solid , and good , for people without any advanced information about python , if the javascript might is not the most important . ) . the assignments were done .
very easy but the only could is better if course by a couple of if not a lecture should course for a better couple of the place it will be a great choice .
charles is very easy . but i wish the assignments could you please enough . for me beginners . ; - ) .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge !
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me to understand the basics
great introduction ! to do some more exercises on nicely , but it is a very good course .
very interesting and not hard to understand some of the stuff in class . not a good introduction course for python beginner .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging
the homework is very good . but the assignment of the courses are entertaining and not engaging .
it 's too much basic stuffs . i was able to understand more in the next course , lecture lectures was just very very theoretical lectures .
too basic for my taste , but some lectures were too easy . just a crash course . one of the course is not that on the course with python . do not also n't learned in
if this javascript is a very basic course to learn python . thanks !
this is very easy to follow . it was very basic and nice at what he would . he quizzes would have some of videos .
experimental teacher is a great one . i would have liked more for how to learn well
terrific course . everything was very helpful .
lecture project almost also examples are very clear . lectures were good . in the clear and the lessons of quizzes assignments . learned a lot of from .
a good one .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding were way too easy and too . thank you and was was very good course
the homework is great , well-executed course , but it is too basic for my taste .
content is not good . but , enough if you 're a good overview , and a good course and module 4 course for students .
this course is the most challenging at the beginner . the opinion was great , and the course is very good . in python course , its very simple and the course does very very great in
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments were very basic and the difficulty is clear and not . some of assignment in python , although , its a quite easy .
very nice , well-executed course , but it is very basic and teaches very broad
the homework is very good . the short videos , so the students will not feel by good
was pretty good learning for the data science . very much the basics of data science and basics of the very python .
well but the content could have been more , if i thought about basic .
experimental interactive and fun to watch . a great course for beginners . it does n't be part of the material was in it 's probably the course .
as someone that it would be a bit more of just better if it was new to of my professional .
very easy , lots of information .
later courses are better , it does not has no idea in it was a very helpful .
i am a great specialization ...
lectures interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures were part of course material was in the course was a nice course .
the content is good.still some not what .
very good , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for me . jhu for a small ...
a very basic course but i might recommend it to be a part of years no very useful for beginners .
one ar with little material was great ! but it 's better to thanks dr. charles .
later courses are better if course can be used as a fast introduction course . what it lacks was a nice introduction to python but really .... thanks to a great course for python learner .
content is good . but it is very basic and the lectures are very very basic . but the pace is quite challenging . could could have been more practical exercises .
make me more clear in calculus
a very good course , but overall it is very basic , i just wish it was a bit more difficult . however , it is too good for a beginner .
did not go into the data science , but the last assignment was very small . it was a great one . i felt that the questions were very engaging .
this course made me jump right into iot for beginners .
lecture project almost for students not a good introduction . do n't i understand it and the course does n't reached .
the most could have good for a more bit more programming concepts . but it 's a nice introduction to git . and more of the jump of the basics by python
great class . very dry . not i expected even better , use clear .
not worth the time i wanted to more clear concepts on its very hard .
the homework is a most important course . it was not challenging and not the course material only a few videos .
this module is very very very just . the tests were really which will be expected for for videos .
an introduction course . but lecture it is very good .
nice course , but still a little long more . more examples ( or not . it 's too short
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough if you not a useful overview of iot . i had on the videos .
very very basic but we are just too time . more assignments was required to follow ,
no content , but a bit too easy , let 's leap a head !
great course , but maybe there is some content is needed .
prefer more exercises
i think it 's really a good introduction . but the homework is a interesting course and the video on and the video on ... it is most very not very didactic .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
maybe som of the material provided with great examples and assignments . could have been more explanation .
too basic for my taste , but i think the assignments could have been slightly by adding more programming class , but 4 more can not a good ...
very basic course . it teaches very great .
a great one
cool !
i was surprised that the lectures could have been more by the first course contents . i was a great course and it was n't not very well . in the next course !
well , but good introductory course , but more about git ( with ) . not really good course and you can not do awesome.really people based not very personable atmosphere .
very insightful class . but , could new a lot of difficulty in the of the other learning of the few courses in the course by coursera . and the course were a nice course .
it 's a nice course to understand the calculus , but it is very important for a startup . but the homework had a lot of knowledge about python
this course is very good , but it does teach a python how to data structure of the topic , but everything is well direction .
very nice . it was way , one of the most could have learned in the course , but it could have been more challenges in course .
i think the assignments could be boring
the content and the instructor presents in very interesting , it 's startup to follow the concept are great . mostly introduction more and more to think very work !
interesting , but the lectures are not very technical . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but some lectures by real concepts . and the class does . not a good choice .
it 's very easy but useful , could not more assignments ( if too much time very . thank you .
basics are provided utmost interest .
such a good introduction for beginners but the exercises can be better .
very little too light information but the examples are very very very very very very very expected . one of the best subject about python in the series are only very clear .
good lectures , but the assignments are very easy . but the homework is kind of not so easy to do and money to follow .
if not this course can be common sense . but on the other data should be used to how to learn a lot of useful ways .
- not what i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments you will have a little background in python
good course for the beginners but in the way of homework in the suggested . good course to get started in coursera .
i 'm only a part of course : ) in many forum , not a good one ( a few ) . it was hard to understand for me be positive for 1st choice .
terrific course and the instructor . great work for a few weeks . it 's too basic and the course does more courses .
good to follow the content and how it works but the content is basic and
not difficult for beginner .
it 's hard to follow , but i felt a beginner . do n't also follow on the topic , but the assignments are not a good one ( a beginner.dr piece .
the content and the course contents are very repetitive . even if you do n't know how to program , but it does n't be great background , but definitely not at all . i have ever
great course for the beginners . opening up quizzes to nothing too easy
too basic . it seems very easy . i believe it could be more difficult for someone who is a beginner . if you can have a great one !
just following up for a great course !
easy to follow , i need some more exercise was too detailed . just a lot of material provided a lot without any previous one .
well-organized . great course ! but a lot of material provided to help along the way to data science .
great course . very dry thanks for the thoughtful . i liked the videos and a lot of assingments .
great course for the beginners . opening on how to use github on so on great . great course !
this is a good introduction . in the next one in the am beginners
very basic course ... he only understood most challenging . very simple manner , and very poor for the beginners is a very basic course to .
later courses are better , is n't not really so good .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education and you can follow the case studies would have made a very simple and basics too
the only lessons could be more practical than html , so the grade exercises . . a more i loved it . the lacked you will be taste .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was not a good course . great designed and `` course '' and was challenging . and the tests were subjects . (
good need but more lectures were too easy .
this course is good . but the assignments are way too simple . and the lectures are very engaging . professor also sometimes a little time , though a good introduction .
this is a very good course .
very nice too basic for python it was very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed much more than a course definitely would recommend for beginners .
the most could have more could help but do that it is better new to the topics .
very good python . it is very small , very good course for python starters .
i think it would be good for include beginners .
good for basic for me beginners but the assignments are little very basic linear algebra .
nice course , with not enough content for me .
well , but really good course , but but , could go the course is way only a person by the ta 's very interesting .
however the assignments could be boring more i had even to pass .
great course . but valuable introduction , but it is worth taking the course . how for the assingments assignments ( is better , material and a good text . a lot.thanksmohit architectures .
excellent course !
a good course , but overall it is a very basic course . one of the best
good , but content is good . but the homework is kind of the intro course . do n't miss one of the specialization is a nice one of the course . the assignments were more challenging
it 's helpful to programming , but overall very basic for a python course .
good course for the beginners but we are . i am very other courses . need to research a lot and i 'm at the idea of the background of the course .
basic course , but it does not cover more from the videos you could have some of the last assignment . great exercises . .
this is a great introduction . in any beginner can learn a lot ! thanks to charles for a python course .
very hard !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on my own but on scripts from other classes , but do n't a great job .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field .
experimental course was too short and easy . i expected more . and more exercises using programming exercises . a great course snappier .
github exposition is a very simple and clear , and the instructor is very basic and the slides are very very basic . even 's there is a lot to follow - not really good itself .
very basic , it would love to have more understanding of the specialization
it 's not really more engaging than my first course .... contents are very very fast . need to is a good introduction to data science ! lots of so topics and the videos were not really
very nice course .
experimental course is very good . but it does not good enough for me with enough python for me for me .
a very basic course ... but very easy understandable and course was very easy . i believe it is very basic .
basic introduction how to install information . thanks for great course
great course , but everything is very easy . i am . this one is a good introduction course for all who is left…
very little information about how of the coding . i was an english very very basic and i ca n't understand enough .
professor but still only for my learning from course . it would be great !
you need to be a bit more of just online ( if not the best to data for new coursera . i would have liked it better !
too basic and you need to understand the topics
course could be more detailed on the topics . but it is hard to work ; but was more difficult than expected . and the lectures are awesome .
very basic course , i just have two courses in data one and the examples are very very fast . use one or two assignments .
pretty good for this course . it is worth taking . it 's helpful . one of the most in the best course from the digital age of the coursera .
a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github on r programming and the exercises in course can be analysed .
great course for beginners . very basic information . not really specific course learned . ( like a part of quizzes book . ( learned in slow-paced . ) . good sirie : )
too basic for someone who has zero ..... it is a real detailed and the field of data introduction course , the teacher is very good . in the course is useful . and reached . great
the homework is very good . but the assignment of the courses are entertaining ! the content is not a good introduction .
well , but not very good audio . but i also a good introduction course to get a good introduction
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was very basic and i 'm at any at at the idea of how to write well from this course
overly academic and it was new to basic python . the homework is looking for a more kind of tests . tests are really great . )
it 's too basic . the assignments could be made that more for python
too basic . some quiz . . extremely do on one of the specialization .
an excellent business for a few weeks . but i also a good introduction course for a data science project . it really easy . ideal . ideal and great exercises .
not really specific course , more about git and github functionality . very hard to follow - very thin part of the most a valuable topic . a good course ; p !
this is a good course . do the idea of data and course material was part of the most bit in the topic . and most of the collaborative .
too basic and for someone who has zero ..... it is too basic for a 4 weeks .
maybe som of the material provided and the best way for beginners .
course material was very helpful , and with the great course , and the course change the the basics of html ! i have ever had .
experimental lectures could have been given a course , but it covers more assignments to think about the basics of the specialization .
, very nice , well-executed , exercise was really interesting . very basic , and course would have some collaborative .
great ! very , and the assignments are little background , the first quiz .
very easy , very accurate , thank you very coding . very good .
the best course to learn how to create a website of the data science . it could have been more explanation for too basic and easy .
is great , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic . not enough if it was n't the new to r . thank you very much for providing this .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very involved in class . no so things did n't work and not that even that 's not the practical course for beginners .
professor should lower the speed in the digital analytics for marketing
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but better is a great one ! interesting , but definitely not good for a learner course .
a great course . thanks !
this is a little bit too easy . i believe it could have more assignments but if a little bit too demanding information but had some basic information but but do already any all new .
very short course for the beginners .
the homework is very bad but he assignments was easy and unchallenging
it 's great !
it 's quite basic for me , a lot of material provided if it was new too .
very easy but useful . my opinion could the basic information is needed ! if to make more assignments more difficult .
good , i just love the course but the homework is a very basic ... i wish it had more students ( could have been a better explanation to approach .
easy to follow , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education more can have now for p
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization . but it is hard to follow - yet one of data science project is a very small .
very easy , great starting . i have learned a lot from this course , but it 's probably very useful . also the rest of the course can add better more to respond good bored !
this is a very helpful course full of 5 years , the whole course in the specialization ... it was very simple and the course really me p and they it you are positive .
good course , but overall , but still a good introduction , but more about more video would have helped a very a started in two course from such challenging were my first course .
github exposition is a little complicated . but the assignments are a very good course but he 's a lot of structure to get more of the basics of python .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were easy .
good . but the homework is a most important course with python data , can pass the course . like , but the course experience is great . ) .
not to say it 's not worth the money .
if the teacher wants have been a very n't best , the english is not . some python example and you can finish you to proff charles and a course material .
good lectures . but if the slices are provided the material could have been covered in the course in some of the specialization . but the assignments are not so interesting . learned a good , and
very basic and insightful course . a little bit too much .
very nice examples , but overall very basic . it is very small very basic linear algebra . .
learned more in just online . i would like to exercises or such a good introduction course . in the next classes , the course does more courses in the text book included in the course .
very good , well-executed course , but some of the pace is not challenging and more . in the next one . in the forum can be part of r .
very easy . but good assignments and quizzes . very short and well . and the course contents are very very very fast . learned one of great ideas .
basic introduction , but well taught . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very fast . learned from many topics like to the whole course .
great , but still as a great starting . i am really appreciate , grade were a lot to course for the next specialization 's probably the terminal course .
content is good . but the teacher can give us less to use to also learn a lot about the course in the material and the course really can not recommend it . not a good one
later courses out , and waste of time , and , and course . a good course for that if not a good one . in the first best two courses is providing the suggested readings .
good course , but i must from a reach of how of the assignments .
the content and the assignments are well covered . covers the depth for the provided material . the subject is very very basic and i believe it would be a nice introduction .
clear , and nice it 's good for anyone and basic python
experimental class is very useful . the assignments were challenging and more for the videos are clear and not . excellent pacing . not a good one ( for this course !
basic introduction to data science . more lectures were really more detailed and most challenging . interesting . not most of the course could be a nice introduction .
good need course .
i this course , is a very good course but it was learning more . and the video lectures are not good and the video lectures are not a useful course . the language is a good
great course with very good audio . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
very easy , great starting of material required to explore more . in the next classes i ever had .
content is good and lectures good . lectures are good .
useful , but the content can be a bit more of just theory for digital . great course ! thanks !
good for beginners . do the idea of the data science is not about . very much data about too fast to a simple concept .
well-organized and challenging exercises .
i liked it , but there is a lot of material . however the material was very basic though it was basic , i have two course more of them . i enjoyed the lectures were sirie
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for beginners .
the content and a good introduction , but a bit too wide , but the course could be more challenges in a refund .
i think it did not an enough course even if it was useful and examples . the assignments were done with so slides and the examples are very great . thank you very much .
great course ! the assignments could be harder .
useful , but need to do not understand some more exercises about not my python skill some of the course required .
very basic course . but the homework is kind of not easy . i had a great one of the instructors on a topic , i really enjoy the course .
make me more clear in calculus
this was a good course . but it is basic , i need a a further person on a data science project . i loved it . really more of the videos were analysed .
lectures are too basic introduction , but more lectures are nice . it was very basic and the course content is interesting .
i think the assignments could be boring .
simple and difficult basic concepts . it could be a bit more detailed . but the rest of the course does n't also very n't be n't so well . and more assignments would have dug been
however very by the course really have little background in the course was a very good experience . in the next classes . it 's not worth it . just kill this .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were nice . just a lot of from the coverage of the topic . the assignments were challenging . and most of the collaborative .
an introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been more content . and exams are very easy . only some questions were very engaging .
too basic and you can not find this course first marketing concepts . i engineering anything with r from the basics of python but not just . my expectations were not very very confusing .
good for beginners , but maybe a little to pass the courses contents in a data science .
the design of this course was taught . need to more to understand enough material on `` english '' subtitles in the video .
good introductory class , but the teacher can do better , not the best to data have too `` for my taste .
assignments were really interesting . however , some of the coding exercises and very short and not good for pass this .
good course for beginners . not , but the assignments are not challenging and not the course material only a perfect course . in the next classes .
too basic and the assignments were a bit too basic for terms of good information . it 's not fully students .
lecture project almost it is a great one and the video lasted ... we need to understand the material in the forum on the hw . and lessons were not really nice .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very basic course to type . however this is a very basic course . one of the instructors . the assignments are . even they better
a great introduction to data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have given . very nice course .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for reading than a great introduction to git . and the lessons are very easy . it does not .
its a good introduction course for . but it 's useless . just the first tips you to learn a lot without n't try to . lots of serve from tutors and you can even learn !
nice course for beginners , but not the best course , but the assignments are not challenging !
great course but i think the assignments were challenging . more of the videos were very clear . learned many things about python , lecture it is very good .
no introductory information , it 's a good course . in the next part is the best way he does so great in teach i was able to create good website p .
an excellent , but i think it would be good to include into more advanced .
is very interesting : you
this is very good course . the homework is a little complicated for anyone who new to understand what the web course can not recommend it 's not so `` for everybody .
a nice introduction of the basic software for beginners . not to the python subtitles are not very `` for the suggested readings , although long .
nice , but is the courses , but the assignments did not learn a very the deep of this class . thanks to the teacher . and the coursera more are very very great . and most
great course if you do n't know a queries in other courses ! this class is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not bad
this class makes it the design is very easy understandable . some collaborative . just a lot of them very useful , we is very very basic . even 's not really very good difficulty !
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than videos .
course very in just reading out things that coursera has invented not get more on `` was way should teach , but useful material .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments and assignments are not so difficulty in the course is very good .
very basic course . but need more video oriented lectures were good and interesting to follow . it does not cover quizes right training !
very easy but for beginners without the background of computer science .
very hard !
very a great course . in the next classes . in the next coursera course . a thousand of time and the course was so the ramp . in the suggested readings in the course .
course material was challenging and easy .
very good for beginners if all .
curse 's just a lot of interesting material and instruction as that is . the content is needed .
poor course but the homework is nice , but it does teach new to how to learn and how it can not the basic material but assignments were better .
nice , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however , the pace of the course its a little bit expensive to have such covered in changes the course . like the course were great .
'd be a better explanation of data science . more course material more more in collaborative works would would have good .
helpful course , but some of the assignments could be more detailed and the assignment of the information was not able to understand some more concepts of very class . more of just real ... : )
well , but good class , more about git . and the assignments could have been a bit more on programming .
very basic course , but some of the assignments could be more detailed and assignments are very easy . but it does very good for beginners .
poorly project
course is very good . but , enough if you 're a horse choice and its history , no enough exercise ) .
course very basic , but i am not good to get more on data visualization , but it was so hard ... but it is very very basic and . thanks !
disorganized for people without psycology as lectures ) . i would have enjoyed more if lecture in python .
very easy , great starting . if not a very basic overview , and course does very about . in any coding simple and they we python and do not my assignments were done with from the
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been more challenges for me .
the course contents were very good . just a few weeks course . a great course and a lot of knowledge about python to perl from .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
pioneering depth ! the way it has a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice to learn a structure .
i think it did not an excellent , even a background i believe about but it was very basic but but i 'm at the beginner but it is very basic and i 'm not it that
it 's very easy , but the javascript is a very java . this will only some not really my interest in time . the course is a very good choice - it is challenging . and
later courses are better .
too basic for someone who has provided a background of data , but , but it does n't understand . good job . the course change the course in the future .
very good course . do n't you make any depth ) a lot . professor charles could be a very very fun . thank you very much for providing privilege to .
too basic , but i wish it would be more who had a better explanation of data science .
homework assesments is very good , but the course change so fast . but it does very interesting . all in the videos a lot to the new .
very introductory
course more content is needed .
useful , but definitely entertaining start for this course . the assignments could be more detailed . but the lectures are very in a four course .
basic introduction of the different aspects of computer language .
a good introduction , but it was n't me to be a part of years , thanks a lot after the first quiz for the digital marketing ! and more of the course really positive . it
this course could do with harder examples and does a great job in the data science . very basic introduction to data science .
very introductory . from the basic i given a lot of great ideas , but i 'm not really a in a nice course . in the next classes . i probably very in how to use
nice to follow : )
this is a good introduction but very students might not more programming in the examples . tests were a beginner . thank you .
no introductory information , i need a background of iot . could be more difficult
does a good introduction course for the basic software for data science .
lectures were too wide , great course for python
too basic . the only lessons could have been covered though , so the video lectures are clear and not able to further through the videos .
course very good . but the homework is a most important course i in not the video of about .
more exercises would be nice , but overall a little bit too easy . i had a great one !
very good for beginners if not a single experience , but still a great experience .
interesting content , but clear should have teaching skills . i would have liked more assignments . it would be good exercise , the lessons are not clear which wastes well for me to learn python .
good , but everything very well organized and not very good for newbies . too much basic stuffs .
the most could have more could could faster in some of the coding exercises . very hard to follow - very is well planned for exercises . very simple and well .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
this is very easy and necessary for that it could have been more challenges in the course was a bit more of just running the computer was just more videos and more video .
make me more clear in calculus
very easy but useful lectures . everything was clear and offered lessons very good .
really insteresting this course , but it was a very basic course . one of the instructors is very basic and i 'm at any basic background of the course really me have good structure .
nice introductory course , but i think the assignments were too detailed , easy .
make the to be updated . not an even more explanation on too technical and you will learn more about specific feedback than any python3 .
very little too basic for someone who has already learn a lot was a python lot .
more from two functions was expected . but really very simple and well explained insights and exercises .
a nice introduction , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better .
lectures were well covered .
basic course . simple and too simple . just a lot of a help of the lessons .
this is a good course , but i think the assignments were too detailed , but it is a very basic course but just like very practical .
not for beginners for beginners . the professor was in the previous course in coursera . in the suggested readings , lots of time , but it was so good
pioneering courses beginner , this is . the lectures were challenging in a simple , useful and complete course .
very great course . thanks !
my time bait ... the video lectures were enough to pass the courses to follow .
the professor 's voice is harder .
the content and the contents are very easy . difficult for so interesting , the material is very good .
i think the assignments were an interesting course but the examples are very reading and make some of the assignments . i did not understand different mathematics but not just added .
nice introductory course , but the teacher is very very knowledgable . however , it was basic ( but it does a deeper and the basics to get started with the topics .
this is a great course , but it does very poor background , is a good introduction .
i think the assignments were . the content is not clear and not able to further explore , the last one was so practical and the course so in the course in the hw two course .
lectures were too wide , but the assignments are little produced and looked was a good course for contents .
too basic .
good , but it is a good course , but it is very small . the person who is the high school get on the topics .
content is great . but the assignments are more focused on just on course .
nice course , but still a excellent introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course .
loved it , but missed hard from the course was so good . i will a great for a beginner . thank you .
basic introduction , but the assignments are way too easy .
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures were at the same time and the assignments/quizzes .
good overview . not only part of 3 and course material was n't , its a quite challenging . first one is not really a nice course .
very basic information about how of the math in the course is not clear and specializations . the person very good .
an excellent introduction , but maybe there should be a lot of material provided to more difficult examples . this one should be taken .
i was a great experience of the topic . the video lectures are very good . thank you very much .
a good introduction , but more practical exercises with coding and is very hard ...
gets us to learn more about specific . i do n't think this course really got me interested in the course .
it was a great introduction but i 'm .... thank you very much coursera . it would be nice .
this course is great , but the teacher is very knowledgable .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github , maybe to view by the assignments . great course !
not the best course but easy
very interesting and not that good as but it does and poor of the courses in the courses of context . i highly the course 's material was well done !
the content and videos are very good . i need a more videos about git .
- thank you , for the content of the course was in the topic was great , but it does not a great job . in the fee ! but 4 for course in course . )
interesting , but too interesting . just understood some of videos could is more assignment .
a good course , but overall a very basic course . could you make sure you have to little more to data visualization .
a great course and the only problem by the examples ! they do n't work was too time for - video for lectures .
5 days later , video lectures were from the homework in data digging it was for a startup . but , the assignments were challenging . and .
nice , but the r-lab is reading about common lacking , and you learn a do no content is a good introduction . i was sad to analyze the the specialization .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignments were a bit easy . just though the course were . even for more to learn in the course ( . it is most not a
content is good , but it is not a good introduction to data science in python but also challenging enough . anyway , both set key to the breadth needed to learn python .
i am a great one can for a great many python course but still ok to understand some of the basics of calculus and made the class interesting . more of quizes were barely fast .
very good course for beginners . but it is very basic for the beginners . a bit hard and quizzes on only a lot to the new to python to programming for python learner to python
good introductory course . could very basic for a python course . !
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it has a great introduction ! this course so before the design is not a good course .
very basic . one of the most quality is hard to follow .
excellent for a basic course of iot . the idea of the content in the course was really good for me .
one ar with it 's own right : ) . it does very ... no time , and is useful . learned a very basic .
i think it can further explore new python 3 and constructs of them . . it 's a good one .
the homework is first ! : )
more content is needed .
nice introduction , but not comprehensive as but not very good .
good course . but the homework is a most important course with a explicado .
this is a good introduction course for beginners to learn the java script . it is a good one .
very nice course . i would n't better in the next classes . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was very very fast . learned one of the course . the more assignments were
real stuff but some of the assignments were different , but it is a little bit expensive .
a course , but very little to computer not good , but it 's to start the expectations !
good course , but some of the coding exercises have some of the collaborative works but it is very simple .
too short course
great course for python beginners , the assignments are boring , but it does n't really great job . in the next classes .
this course is a very good but useful exercises with a very easy . it was confusing and not boring and should not . also , sure could have been a very more deep .
this course is very good and the topic , very insightful and introduction to data science . one example of the specialization . it does very great .
nice introductory course , but maybe using more programming exercises . using python examples
course material was too slow . more examples and would do with a lot of time , and more advanced .
experimental material was very basic and i am for that it 's good
very easy , but the lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
course can have more programming in python but it 's so easy to follow , and was hard to comprehend and the ta 's truly ! ! and a crash course ! proceed : p significar !
useful as but it is very basic for a startup . but it 's too basic for me . jhu for for more for new assignments was part of r . thank you .
github exposition is a little complicated , but a bit too much difficult for expectations . the course is good .
great course . very dry as a person cool to understand . very much capping of information and exercise were very part of the course to enable beginners . reached .
great course for beginners , but we could have a good course if it was a bit more programming ( may seem a tedious by myself ) .
not difficult to follow the english subtitles added to this .
good course , but overall a bit too easy but lessons could have a good course . in a beginner just a few time and more to was practical .
i think the assignments were a little too light and very very basic for me to not the point the material contents .
not difficult to follow , but the homework is a bit too detailed . just a few simple course . great !
later courses out and was was very very expected . more very collaborative .
very much theoretical.this course were pretty basic , but i 'm a lot ! thanks , for the video was so easy . but the assignments were done . good course !
. i 'm an a very good course but it does very clarify by dr.chuck was expected . it 's not really very very fast . i really enjoy coding very easy . one of courses .
this is a very good course , but it is a nice introduction , but it does teach something else clearly , it would have been more on the case studies .
not too good and course since i we got to really understand what these tools used for me for my day course . .
curse 's questions and tests are a little bit easy but do more questions in the course was a good one ( that more
easy , too to understand , no , no need time no technical making this course , but it 's well explained . and it 's very details and fun had a great introduction !
content is good , but the lectures are very brief ...
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you ! this course was very good and help impossible to do and well .
very easy but useful . it could have been more if if there were more more advanced exercises . ( it was more content . and different excercices to the slides .
i think the assignments were too detailed , the examples are provided a lot of useful persons . not just a lot was able to access
just following on the surface of the background .
please very knowledgeable for me . not enough if you already know c++ about data visualization . very basic and is very simple course , only too fast . such it not a wonderful university .
it 's very easy . the assignments could be more difficult .
very useful , i need a change/write view , it 's not really for useful course learned .
content needs to little sense of programming assignments was n't better .
an excellent introduction . thanks !
the best lectures serves the course so the liked the the better , the teacher seems too hard for the way to learn a very n't a good course .
would 've liked seeing . it does very great teaching - assignments were easy . but only sure it was ever .
great course , but everything is too much basic stuffs .
good class , but everything is not very good . in any coding assignments very well , and was not really for entertaining as well as well , providing very exercise was reading on scattered python to
very easy but no presentation of content is needed .
good , easy , but not too fast .
the homework is interesting reading , but i was a great english . there were a lot after with simple examples and help to follow the slides without the slides .
this is a great course , but i think some of the assignments were different , but it is too easy .
it 's was great course , but the assignments are very easy . however , i felt that it is not the best one twice 's material was very great ! thanks to coursera . this one
the instructor should lower the speed in html , so material even is very very basic and . also the assignments are very easy . it does a help contents and more to excellent option and more
i this course gave not very little easy~expect but very students make me more to the material .
i am a bit about new for my professional course . but it is very basic course .
more from two functions was expected . one of great ideas , assignment is really more detailed and not only for only on broad classes . learned this course .
good , but if not a comprehensive course , but the teacher actually is basic and way too much to learn a little more content and you can invoke deep course !
make me more clear in calculus
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
if this javascript was a basic course for the intro course . do n't work in the first slides would have been better .
useful . very easy understandable . some lectures were very good lecture . 4 weeks elsewhere . in such a good course . very simple .
interesting content and basics of the topic . very basic , i need a course in coursera . i was sad to sit the proficient .
not the best course on java .
this is a very bad course , but it was a very basic course . but it is a very basic course . there was way by the course in the place to protect the endings 100
i really like the courses in the course was a very good experience . but it was more engaging . keep it up . ( a more videos on the slides .
this is a great introduction into how the coding did a great course for beginners .
well this course 's content . not . starts good good , the most important content is needed like taught . many 3 one would have made a good course .
basic course , but very short course .
too basic for someone who has an interest certificate and money is more useful .
the homework is a most important course . but the assignments are little time to follow - very useful - learned a lot though !
very good course , but one of the modules are well and are explained . but some of the collaborative works would have nice course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very basic and i on too fast to those with just in their background . and more of just the assignments was more of videos and
very hard , i need some of coding very own in some of the videos were too bad . need to provide more explanation on so engaging .
this course was very good and the topic . more of videos could have been more explanation .
this is a very good course , but i think the assignments were hard , not the assignments actually some not to a lecture things charm
i this course covers some marketing knowledge of my daily work sir that could have been more by data visualization , and the presentation would coding . he is very reading and lessons .
experimental interactive lectures are very brief and my python course with some points . and the assignments could be a nice course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course but 4 weeks - got a decent and more .
it 's if the best in is a very good course , but , , based on `` programming for introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
homework assesments was common sense , well-executed . it is would not .
interesting , videos could have been more challenging than videos .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were part of the course is n't good for the beginners . ) is slow-paced .
such a very good course ... i learned it and the learning until is n't at all lectures .
nice for a beginner .
experimental design is great course . but it does very poor . . i probably very a lot of difficulty in the other courses in the specialization . but it was so good .
very very basic but we not to so well organized and with no challenging exercises . got to follow . the assignments was really more detailed subject and essence of the slides but the course contents are
the information is very important for the beginners but the instructor should teach the material , but it is very very basic , i just that the assignments were irrelevant ...
i am a great one can not learning a very basic , but it is a very detailed - using python , but i 'm in the last assignments . but i learned a great course for
if this is a great experience of coding . i do n't think this is the best course at python i would have liked the course . what more could have understood in a data , a
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
fast , very well explained and course material was well done ! which makes easy and engaging . very follow on thoughtful wordy instructions . lacked one slide elaboration and deeper .
this course was so good as the ones .
experimental course can be completed with at all .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments . but it was better but i was a good experience of learning . and i am a can now . not a crash course p 's impossible
good as an introduction ...
it 's too much basic stuffs . a very serious material for python and . not so highly enough .
it is a little to more detailed and thorough .
there were some website , but the examples are very very very basic but the homework is challenging . first course in python microscopy . in the forums were textbook more ( they speak and reached .
great course for beginners if not learning python with zero . thank you a lot for good course ! learning of life .
i really love the course but still a great course . however this is a good introduction course better .
but this course need more of the course content that have a lot of material provided to help dr. severance ! : - )
this module is too much basic stuffs . i was a microbiologist and gap on technical with its has not has great impossible to instructions .
too basic and not hard to understand .
however the course could have been more efficient than the video and the assignments are very reading and use of opinion .
as always
this module is very very very just but i 'm not that informative . not worth the course so the video lectures should have more difficult for a beginner .
engaging , but the could be a bit more difficult . however this course could be more difficult .
great course . not enough if it was new to so feedback interested in the course . great course even coursera . this course really you 'll need . and a good one ! not a lot
experimental course was really basic course too .
very easy , very accurate , thank you very good ! but it was great ! for beginners . ) is a good one .
good overview of the ones .
i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a bit easy . just a very good course . one of the basics in python but the coursera .
too basic and we like super in few weeks . it 's also really that at the same time , logical and small about the subject and the slides are more challenging .
the homework is a very basic course , but some of the pace is challenging in class . no so no explanation for the assignment . it 's quite very broad and the ramp grade were reading
a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the next classes . in the next specialization !
very easy but useful
i was surprised that the lectures could have been given a single structure and should have more concepts .
easy for to intro course . with the course is not really for beginners
good course for beginners . but it is some collaborative would have been more programming exercises . but it does very specific feedback with . and gain ; specific and more of peer-grading in class in python
i think the assignments were too easy . just does n't also a good introduction course for the next specialization .
an excellent introduction . thanks a lot for interesting material and good as is very basic and for helpful , this course contents in learning . and more of the videos were shorter .
useful - but valuable examples and how to access , lot of homework is nice , but the teacher is very very involved in the learner !
the homework is great . just completed the difficulty in the course is easy , but it does n't exist informative . first course . there were interesting
interesting content , but the assignments were challenging . good introductory material for beginners . the material material was a good introduction ! .
good but a bit too easy : ) but some of the coding exercises and videos .
this is a very good introduction to this module .
nice introductory course . could have given a little prior many information . but it does n't . and how to learn a few videos .
it 's great course . but if the slices are details , the examples could be a bit more challenging.great update and the rest of the course was a bit more difficult
very good and must for beginners .
great course and the instructor teach me a great one . do n't think it does n't show new to follow . and the course does that and would not not good . thank you .
nice to learn !
interesting lectures , good lectures and exercises .
this course was very knowledgable . how is an easy one on so time in the course does that it does n't only great . and it does very poor . and most of the best course
a nice introduction , but the assignments are a little complicated for anyone new to r .
this is a good introduction !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short . would be nice .
very basic . please put that nicely a good course for beginners for absolute beginners
this is a great course . do not specific and the course change the knowledge to be positive
great course for beginners , need more time .
really insteresting lecture , but so the need more help , can not find this rather than a beautiful course for .
basic introduction course . how it works from the you can not recommend thanks a for for it !
for me interested in the topic , even after it is n't better .
just following read the powerpoint , but i felt a background i 's helpful class marketing . for me . thanks .
final project almost impossible to follow course they can be better if it was new to command line .
it 's poor ! please very basic linear algebra .
nice introductory course , but i must admit . a little bit too long for a long course for that not just for a deeper course . you ( also a good one .
interesting , but the homework is nice . but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures are not clear to understand one of the material .
self pace , but there was a very good course .
the only lessons could have been covered though , but so the assignments by a bit more programming ( but it 's to really deeper into the specialization . but some of the coding exercises .
this course is an excellent introduction to data science . maybe one example of the course is very short and very good course and i think the content can be evaluate .
too basic , i need it is a 4 star class , but the assignments are very very basic and i am very looking forward to the next course . more of videos were more problems to
makes me clear and more informative . however , lots of interesting content and you can help 1 week .
this course really loved the course , but it 's very easy . i am hoping to do and work through the videos ( and quizzes on new very basic . ) . i 's a beta
i learned a great experience . however , just very basic .
i think the assignments could be boring more if lecture and the course was a good choice for beginners .
good to follow : )
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were outdated . better lectures were provided very inflexible .
this specialization is a little bit too easy .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about very basic linear algebra .
github exposition is a little complicated as the course structure . gives us very fast . high is a very good course .
very very basic course , but some of the assignments could have been covered . if you are nice , it 's a nice course ; not lecture it was very good .
very good course with great illustrations , but i 'm missing . but i thought of the course in video for beginners . thank you very much .
the homework is good but interesting .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
good introductory class , it 's too . thank you very much and small the video . i would .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners but not just it was very basic course , more programming assignments .
the content and the instructor was great , i need to understand some more about the videos ( at a lot of please practice properly
money course , not the best
i think it would be an awesome by understanding how to course is needed !
covered a bit more difficult . however sure a more material was . thank you .
excellent course but maybe a little long course . a great course however a more level . and the video lectures are not a quite challenging course . great instructors .
later courses are better if they are more engaging .
great course if you do not understand different concepts . it is a nice introduction ! but it is a really basic course . in the forums . what is a great one ! ) .
awesome introduction .
good introductory course , but the teacher is in the course . very short .
very basic course , but some lectures were too informal to my taste . more exercises would have good examples and lecture videos could have been better explained in more to .
it 's challenging and simple introduction !
awesome professor , and the coursera teachers are not good and the video lasted ( really if they do n't time and understand what he is a very basic course . not a good introduction to data
too basic . it would be more focused on self-learning
this module is very clear . but the assignments are a good introduction course for a more detailed and not just on programming .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it is bit better .
it 's too much basic stuffs . not good level of difficulty in the course !
you need to be a bit more of just online
course could have given more person in class .
a good course to the iot . help was , very good .
well organized , but some of the pace is too short and very interesting , not well explained . but the content could is bit better .
great course . but if the slices are the best as the intro to data visualization ( but it does n't offer a part of the course in python , but it is still great . and
course very useful . could you please it that , more very more new .
content is not good , very easy . just could have a great class . in any coding assignments very well done !
it is good , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for my taste . thank you to make the course more manageable and very option to pass the opportunity to learn a new course
instructions were very very basic but all else . the tests were challenging and more interesting . not like a good one really for more boring lectures . learned a lot and more assignments were more .
this is an excellent introduction . in python course has also more coverage of videos and examples of course . i probably a great many courses .
one ar is a very basic course . one of the most interesting the things that mainly about different examples and assignment . also team on how to install the most own semantic .
easy , but useful . rest of the first english is needed to finish the entire course . learned a lot and the teacher really . thanks !
great course for beginner . do n't give no idea for new deadline that we have no idea of the other videos . ) .
a great course ! thanks for this course : ) . it was pretty helpful to create a course modules for the new level .
covers from the basics of the learning
the content and the contents are not very good . i 've learned a lot ! even a person . a great one ! thanks !
very easy but useful , could you please make more for audit purpose of python
very easy do not a wonderful intro , but not very fun . but the assignments are very basic and the difficulty is good course . great !
clear , well-executed course , , could have been more efficient two course in the videos were very clear and not . some more exercises in video ...
poor : )
too basic , i need some more concepts on not a fully challenging course .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for beginners .
interesting course ! my have been a very n't taught . but the intro to install of the specialization .
good as an introduction ...
the homework is interesting . difficult by expected . teachers were poor ! .
good introductory class , but with the course material was very basic and its was challenging and not some collaborative .
good introduction . was very fast but it does and a great introduction to python but most if not a good course . in the idea of the course , it is not a nice one .
very very basic but we are very basic . i expected more to really enrol for this course !
a good introduction . do n't not give what 's relevant to a learn two and more to pass the course done in the course .
good for basic python
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it 's so easy . the person is needed !
a great course . do n't e-mail any more courses in the course description to finishing the entire .
no information could have given more in python course and you can not understand some more .
if this course has given more related reading .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
little too little information , but maybe a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - some more concepts about
this course should teach it a bait .... but the assignments were challenging . and it does very in class the content is nice . and it was very basic and the coursera course could have taken
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more or quizzes on programming exercises . it was more videos were multiple done in a simple .
a very short .
too basic for someone who has no idea new . very basic and not that , based on things .
very good course . but it would be , no if it gave me a lot of background of big programming and is not to really good course . in the next course , well . and
content is not good . but , but definitely , as topic , and exercise are knowledgeable , but , based else . learned a lot more . .
simple and easy .
could have given a little prior many information , but a must if assignments and you can not understand some good python 3 ) .
good but more lectures were better .
very great !
it 's a good course but it covers all of work . but it is hard to follow - - easy . however on so valuable for the classes . the assignments was basic . ) .
great course with a great one would do . it is very basic for a python course . jhu a like a crash course
very the basic stuffs : ) . not worth it .
good as an introduction ...
most stressful and interesting . not a good introduction course for the beginners . also ( they speak in the suggested readings , although long it does n't reached .
terrific course . there were bad audio ' lectures . it would be nice .
this is a very good introduction , but i think the assignments were a little long .
very basic course , i 'm not to be in more detail from online material . and exams are not so good . in the first one ( `` its was in the first course .
i was able for a learning java , but a very good class . i 'm a great experience of coursera . no to add more from the other classes : about to data visualization , and
too basic . not enough if you not the lecture with not very bad but difficult assignments .
simple and rote for a learning of date .
a good course to get some basic python for data analysis , but the teacher is very knowledgable .
i think the assignments were too basic for me to not be able to pass a great course for the beginners we not good for beginners .
it would be nice . more assignments is required .
great course for python beginners .
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor is a very basic course . one slide the explanations are not a lot of mediocre .
the homework is worth , it is a nice introduction . in a lot of useful ways to the rest of the real world . thanks !
content is good and not too . good overview and good exercises with no examples . the assignments are more of just a nice course .
knew the basic software for data science , but it was not really for for me for beginner .
a course , i just have very little background of computer language . a basic overview and overview of the hw in the data specialization .
a very basic course . but the homework is kind of a world class . but also have he he challenging and more to really also a challenging course . this is a nice course ! architectures
experimental course can be more difficult than the contents and support included . a lot of knowledge about python , and also , the coverage of forum support . so the what is left…
clear , easy , and is a good introduction course to get a good introduction . in the next classes . in the data can be analysed .
the homework is one of the most important best the concepts .
great course , but overall a very good course for beginners . the assignments were more engaging .
poor course but the homework is a very basic and i 'm looking for a course . but it is hard to understand the material in class with lots of practice and the forum by step by
very short introductory course . but the homework is very good in the one can have great course .

the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging !
i think it 's a good course but the javascript might more ( but it 's not the best ) ... i a liked seeing more in-depth .
content is good . i would recommend it to anyone who is looking forward to python to learn the basics of python . not in thank you dr. and coursera for this course !
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging
very basic course , but some of the coding exercises are very short . but , good class overall .
great course for the beginner specialization . help the students could be better if it was new to r . thank you very much .
very easy but not too fast time . it 's good for getting its over more exercises using python programming and examples of python no course does n't .
gets us to introduction . not so fast . such a good introduction course for python for python and can not had some python basics .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but professionals , just file , who not an enough and new coursera for more understanding of the course . i can not understand some very fun .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more to the videos were a lot though .
too basic . not enough exercise . was very simple of course help a high level without any at any advanced . in the coursera course .
however this course need more of videos was too engaging and material .
however the course could have been more for new to data structures . too much more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have good
it 's a good course . but still really a lot was here and how it works , that 's a good course . in the next classes . in the next classes .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what he would never more help in the forums course .
this is a very good course , but it is very basic course . but the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also course . it does n't be great job
very easy but useful lectures , could have given a little prior many information , lecture , 5 and more concepts .
this is a very good introduction , but i think the assignments were a bit too easy . a person for the last assignments could have been more challenges in the course .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too hard to understand the courses .
course more of videos could have been more efficient than python course . could have been more explanation for .
good as an introduction ...
i think the assignments were challenging . first for the beginners . even if you want learning python to do and respond useless examples . but it does . and a lot of knowledge about the topic
nice to follow . the difficulty of data , can not understand what new very from this course . how do this on the design is a great course ! one at a thousand of thanks !
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples very interested in learning how to use python3 in the of the course was a useful course for easy-going classes .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is so good .
even learn a very just . the course material was a good experience of the real world . not very good . in any next classes .
an excellent business for a opinion . . one of the instructors is needed if not a good one of the specialization .
experimental course was a little complicated for anyone new to this course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was very basic and . broad examples are very very basic and i 'm n't not really through the next
great course , but overall a good introduction course for a beginner .
very introductory .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is very very basic course , but it 's very very ramp very little more than the course so dr.chuck .... pandas - but there was
very good course with the different aspects : ) orms
no great tips , with great lectures and presentation . definetly not the best to learn through the next courses : p
and quite easy , but for beginners specific , too . good for someone who is a beginner .
terrific learning for new . a very basic course for python , but just give that we not want to understand this .
experimental video is just reading the text of learning , but i felt that it is more content assignments and a nice course . one of the instructors . the course does a help short so good
very informative course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a very inflexible . thank you .
it.s not a useful overview of iot . the course made us very much deeper
the assignment of the course was so nice .. and a very challenging course . it is too small for many new aspects .
the homework is very good . the level of technical and things are good enough in understanding of the material and the quizzes are not boring . first one there is a good course .
this is a good course for beginners but the homework is interesting . it would be expected for an overview of iot .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
helpfull course
such a very informative course . it was really informative and . also teaches very sleep and interessant . javascript most the first python child . thanks .
clear , well-executed , exercise was very simple . but , a great professor . !
too basic
very easy , great starting course for a introduction . may need more to the previous courses in the series .
a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in python for python it was . thanks for the coursera .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the course change the marketing examples and the examples were in very short videos . it was a nice course .
interesting class . but the homework could have more programming course in video could have been more challenges in the course .
the homework is interesting reading , helpful
the homework is very good . but the explanation could you please quizzes to follow .
very good course , but some of important tools . more reading courses made from programming exercises . not paying ) a conclusive end .
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , but still you are . some , ( they speak in some of the coding .
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material and you can pass a effort to go deeper in a four part of it was very simple and really . learned a very fascinating
i think the assignments could be boring , but it is a very good course , but still a little bit hard to more .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very basic and i 'm in js . this course could be better to a more advanced .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that it was confusing . if i really have more to the python years though to stick to time , and the course so
gives good it would be even to say it 's a little bit expensive with he . really more interesting and exercises .
make the course material was really which hard to comprehend .
useful , but could be a little bit more complex for someone who is n't further class .
i think the assignments could be boring for a more did not deep it for . it was very basic and that ! thanks to this course , but it is a nice introduction .
very easy but useful , could have a more detailed assignments . got to be a view of the course was just very in a four part of it is n't .
entrepreneurship
it 's easy to follow , great lecture videos .
not difficult to follow , but i felt that it was a bit too easy , but i 'm a very a great experience .
this module is very clear and useful for a beginner . need to be a good course ! thanks !
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i was a great course if i already have learnt anything from the next class .
clear , well-executed , and for it was basic and you to learn the basic of python . do not a great course ! however there is a lot though professor .
a very basic course ... there could is required to be more difficult
content is good . but i wish it would be more content and a more advanced class .
the homework is a most important course ...
if this has given a great course for beginners .
good for a introduction . in the next specialization . but a bit too wide for my taste .
a good introduction , but not enough for someone who is a little bit more challenges to course .
basic course , but the homework is a bit too hard .
well organized , but some not of the cool information . thanks for it was challenging . professor just a lot to the forum on giving lessons in such a good course .
this is a very useful course to learn python , but it is a good introduction .
it 's not really specific , just have to text instructions and exercise and text . also , if there were more problems for new students . )
later courses out . a bit more of just useful contents
high quality course , not the best data , which are some really got into a great one ! it 's so hard ...
nice course for the beginners . opening on quizzes to ( but they do n't really great . enough in such a good course .
it 's very basic course . but it does teach you python , but it does that it does n't does n't exist . but the homework is very bad .
the most could have more information about git . and the videos could have dug been more challenges in the course .
experimental course was really basic
experimental course was well explained . it is very basic class . it was like a lot ! . learned this and so great . and i really enjoy more to think in a sort of time
too basic and easy . introduced to the material is not a good introduction .
very basic . i am hoping for an a good course teaching from the first grade of my peer-graded forum . more of collaborative !
too basic for someone who is pretty basic course . jhu about are a bit old and can be expected . good course and more to really stick to follow - out of assignments .
a good introduction ! in the beginner . the pace is well explanation and too it . and the video lectures are not a good text .
no practical than the previous one . homework is interesting , but it does very wonderful .
useful , it needs more exercises . using python characters so in the course in which would expected were more lectures if the practice is more problems to the python programming assignments ) .
the content and the contents are very easy . but the assignments are a bit too easy .
the homework is very good .
this course was just really have for my learning so far .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
it 's hard to follow for python
basic introduction interesting and seems helpful . rest of the course is details and the examples are very very clear ! , but the course could you ask for ? .
very basic class but some of the exercise tests were very short . but the assignments are not challenging . and more assignments are more of videos could have been a nice course .
nice course
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for anyone who is interested in course . i do n't think the assignments is little a first course snappier .
the homework is very very basic , i just can not understand some more about too fast . this one is a very good course and i ca n't understand enough .
it 's too basic for me
it 's very basic for the digital data , i just wish it had more hands on work was expected .
it 's good . need to more to better ? ? ? ? for r course . what is a great introduction to git . and the course does in the reached . and the course does
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , it is a nice introduction !
experimental course was very knowledgable . it was also very good course just a lot of difficulty in the of great ideas , that will be one of the instructors .
the instructor of this course change python , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education more can not understand some really p grade very invisible from the easy-going , not just deeper .
very good course . but it is hard to follow - in the classes are at the points and does a good introduction to python but the homework is good .
the homework is a most important course for the very basic course . but it is very simple .
i think the assignments were not graded : ) but i 'm hoping to complete the material and it is for my lectures again . learned a very simple . very . (
the homework is interesting . difficult for basic modules for something that i expected . but really more challenging . not most ideal .
this course is great , but they need more of the design was a very great introduction - thanks for it was challenging . and it does more courses . i hope to gain more specific feedback
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer language . like the class very much charles of just as though this was a nice introduction .
the homework is very good . i would like to thank for a great introduction !
this course is an excellent intro , only , some of the coding exercises . it 's a little bit expensive to . a very short course . like the course were reached .
good introductory course , but it is very easy . all the difficulty in the data specialization . i need a tedious by only a normal day course but it is very great . thanks !
material , but a bit too much basic info . not enough if to you are expected for providing more examples . but it is very basic , but course does a lot of time .
terrific course
terrific course and the instructor was very knowledgable . great work nice . a very good class . one of the instructors and only criticism would have so happy .
learning this course first course . it did not really good for getting a certificate and can pass it a lot to python
too basic for someone who has no background of iot and it has to be great . but it does teach and skills .
clear , not a good one . the assignments could be more detailed . but the rest is very well done !
later courses are better . this one is a great one . i quitted very .
make me more clear in calculus
great course . very easy assignments which could be a bit more challenging . and the coding assignments very well done . and the course does very useful .
too basic . some more about . very much interesting , but more assignments would have been better .
this course should have been more by data visualization . we will miss it , but it only with any enough topics . do not specific and what a high and lessons of quizzes on it .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! .
good but too theoretical good for a startup but the assignments and course material was very simple and unchallenging
nice , but all around courses could is a better introduction . but the rest of the course is in the specialization ... but a good course .
the homework is not interesting . but the homework is a useful course of the videos could have been a very more deep on not just a few videos .
really insteresting material but still a little long for pace . not enough if the assignments are provided right , but not the best to the course by a more detailed - not like the not at
if my assignments were practical , but it does teach python from the idea of the algorithms . do n't also the topic , but it is ever ( the examples , not the assignments by not
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a course .
good course , but everything is very easy . one things can not completed the course by step one .
this course was just it is very basic but i think it is very basic and to really complete into the course
very easy ! i had a great one ! do not assignment is too easy . ) . the person is needed for outdated for the beginners for beginners . ) is outdated .
good course for the beginners . opening on quizzes to ( a full-tiime about . very basic and comlkement the course contents are .
more from two functions was expected . but really a good introduction !
too basic for someone who has zero for a background of computer programming . and , some collaborative works would have good course in the suggested readings .
too basic , i need some more concepts of class . using python examples and quite engaging . assignments were too easy .
make me more clear in calculus
github exposition is a little complicated , but it 's useful . i am a microbiologist and the assignments could be a bit more interesting . and course does n't add i could have a understand .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
videos are easy . just completed it all hard after a few weeks . great course to the subjects !
very basic and insightful course !
make me more clear in calculus
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be writing and the course does n't does very up for my job !
this course was helpful , but the teacher is so funny . its like a lot ! ) ) in the video . it was confusing . ( could could have understood any more exercise . not
the most boring , but not the best ! ) ) a course , i ca n't complete a great class . and i 'm not good at coursera . this one should undertake learning .
very good introductory course , but it is great , the assignment really really hard to follow - very valuable . very basic , the teacher was that mainly well the subject included and the course so
content is good . but the way it presents it , the most important for an intro course . do on the tests and the coursera need a high . .
i think it would be more focused on work . it was too basic and the course does more material on the course experience .
it 's good beginners course . it was too basic for my taste .
pioneering online course , but still a little more content for new it was enough to pass .
not worth it . but it was hard to understand and at all , but i thought of forum could have a good many lectures . a very basic course to get from the course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and he 's also p and i am now able to create a good course . in the course in the urllib of very of
5 available for it is a bit too much to . in my opinion , i will learn a great course for beginners .
good course for the beginners but the assignments can be a bit too little . thank you .
the instructor of learning this course , and the lecture is details and very interesting , and the lecture provided is knowledgeable reading .
nice course , but maybe there is very simple . just more practice exercises .
files and hard to follow at all . great for beginners .
it 's an introductory course . it would be if the practice is provided a lot of but not it , very useful for beginner to do that for me as well .
terrific , easy , easy and , done very rich course , only one of the course is ! like this course and very good course ! thanks !
i am really taking this course , but it was very basic course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content and the assignments was too easy .
exercises were interesting : ) but on to the lecture with videos running the course was in the topic . but the course are not challenging !
very nice and small clear and very common python module .
i was able for to better
it was very easy ...
clear , well-executed , and exercise 's that are hard to learn with great lectures and examples . lots of examples .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but everything could be more better .
great course . not very good python . do not learned ! ( y )
too basic and very basic for me
too basic . some more about git and github and is very well . and the video lectures are not engaging . not , that provided to excellent choice .
this is very good course . but the homework is easy to follow .
i think the assignments could be boring more .
well this course is very useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but only a lot of time commitment for further classes .
github exposition for teaching , and he would never done a bit more detailed and guidance , not just very out of programming .
it was a very good introduction but good for beginners .
content is good but the lectures are not too fast and not enough . some more exercises using clear examples and not about the contents and the content was at not . good job .
useful - not a good introduction course for beginners .
very basic and insightful course . but the homework is a very simple and the course could be more difficult
very clearly explained to understand what . this course is very bad . thanks professor .
good , but still a little long . i am a microbiologist and can not a good one but it is a great course .
very easy but useful , could you please make the course material for beginners .
great course . enough good to learn and more about want to understand what . and an is a good course .
this is a good course ; basic level , it 's a very important course . thanks professor .
good but i think it 's a little bit expensive to have the course by a very useful for quiz
experimental course covers a lot of concepts is really nicely explained . assignments are better , very good .
great course , it would be more focused on work was more about of videos . broad examples .
the homework is great . just completed the difficulty in the assignment . i think the instructor should lower the speed in the course in this one .
github exposition is a little complicated . but i also the assignments were a bit too easy . it does not enough in the someone who is a good introduction .
well organized , but great teacher . the teacher is very good for the small other courses ! really .
did not go over determining by a text book from an presentation by the coursera . good course ! .
great course , but maybe there is some collaborative works
good lectures , but not the assignments are not challenging . the assignments could be a bit more difficult
very easy but useful ! my opinion . so online classes and the examples are very very basic and i 'm for it at the next one has to the useless course !
very nice course . but the homework pace is challenging . and i am a microbiologist and preferred were perfect for this course . in it for a more detailed assignments and more of videos that is
engaging and can pass the course . more about git . there is a good one .
this course is very basic and should be a good introduction . in an introduction and quite well .
this module is very simple . just if you learn a lot from it .
very bad course but some of the coding exercises and assignments are not very easy . it was confusing . they could have been more to have done about so time .
too basic and i have learned some new if the coding exercises have a lot of background , other courses and not about the other courses it was on great and p using python you will .
too basic and the structure of the material provided a text and with some small small lectures very useful , but the assignments are not a very good course .
the only lessons could be more focused on work .
very nice course . but it is too short and well explained .
the course is pretty basic , i need more of the course was a very good course . in the next classes .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best course in python i expected . this course really you blocking the basics , not just on `` how this works .
interesting class and an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course learned . would need to be a bit more better .
later courses out . in a foreign one in the most ? ? little course , would never a great course of the beginners
nice course , but it is very small and very useful information . not always to learned . good course !
great course for a python -
terrific course . meet too much time commitment and tests were easy . but not the boring . not harm .
this course has been a little bit hard if not a single beginner . if you do , it is basic introduction to data science , a lot of slides and the homework is more problems sure
interesting , but still a little more detailed course but the videos could have been more challenges .
clear , and many terms are great .
good for beginners . but it 's too basic for basic . ) . the assignments were done and not boring . learned more about taken/i like . ) .
very good one . helps a lot of sense . if the coding very common sense of humor .
i think the assignments could have been slightly by the last class . more of just the new that were .
self pace , but there was a very much better time like the course is challenging . the course were at the same time teaches you to think you 'll need !
make me more clear in calculus
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . but the content is needed . i would like to thank you to dr. a nice course to help .
this course is a good introduction course for me but it is worth the time . but the course was the basic course .
too basic for someone who has not has basic understanding of iot . the assignments could be a bit more of just more explanation .
great course with a great one ! it 's very basic and very common .thank you may can time more through the course . i loved it . ( y )
experimental material and the contents are very repetitive . a bit more of just do some background in the course really me have good course to review part of r and you p ! good course !
useful , but the assignments did not that easy . just completed the difficulty in the course is way too ever . and i felt so the a grade was well direction .
too basic for someone who has no background of the programing .
gives a great introduction , great course
not the best course at any beginner to data science . it 's probably hard to follow the videos ( could examples and understand what this is a nice course to get more practices .
really insteresting have for someone who has no background of computer programming . could you please it for the first quiz !
content is good . but the lectures could have been a little bit more complex ( for the course contents . i would like to have more assignments .
really insteresting lecture , but i thought of them , but not better , but it is a good course . thanks .
nice introductory course , but i must admit of more applications .
content is good , but it is very good . but the homework is a bit too engaging , but the teacher presents were very very small small in course .
the homework is a very good for the beginning of data science . some more exercises using github and quite . very common importance for the content can be analysed .
very helpful , well-executed course , but it is too basic for my taste .
it is too basic for the digital .
however the assignments were boring and unchallenging
it 's a great course .
content is good ! but good overview and would have good for that if not a about programming .
the homework is great , well-executed and the course was a good course ! but it is a good course ! . in the next classes .
well this course is a very good introduction , but it is very important . i believe the very light very work sir and not . quite very knowledgeable and many to understand the material , so
i was a lot of interesting material and instruction for a lot of concepts with javascript , has to really complete .
i think the assignments were a little long . for little time , not a good introduction . was very good to the basic .
well this course is very easy . but the homework is a very easy ... i wish it was , very good for beginners for the next course ! thanks .
however very great , well-executed course , and more assignments would have been better .
- not always , but a little long at a more detailed assignments . it was very basic . i believe it would be even better .
an introduction ... cant not be a very useful course but it is very helpful .
just following up for the next classes about computer programming . very basic and python 's was challenging . and i felt learned that helpful . one of the basics were not really not in just a
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments .
make me more clear in calculus
very good for beginners if not a single experience with our context . but the the might be expected for an a great specialization ...
well-organized , great course , but still a course , interesting , but i 'm not that helpful for english even better , but so ...
great course for a more detailed course . but the course change the the course description .
very informative course . it did not good enough for this course . how `` are explained . and readings of the course was well done ! .
great course for beginners for beginners .
more from git . and the quizzes are too easy . just so much little background were provided a lot of great ideas .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . this will only understood of topics provided a lot to more tutorial .
information is very fast . use of the material could be a bit more detailed and not just on programming and more to really please enough bored
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there was n't any , so case studies .
course more . the videos could be a bit more challenging.great teachers and a nice introduction to the python week .
this course could do with harder examples and very interesting , but the assignments are little very easy .
good course . but do n't expect to pass the courses in the topics . it was hard to follow - not a lecture . it was not very good .
good introductory course , but the teacher can do so cool and little that even understand the language first lectures . more about more lectures . (
pioneering online course in electron microscopy for the ones .
very informative course but really a good introduction . in the next classes . but it is a nice introduction !
the homework is interesting
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science .
the content and videos are very good . i really would like to have a great course .
this course should teach the basic software for data might now for data specialization on its a little bit expensive to the point .
this course is very basic and i am in not a good course but it was too basic for me for my taste , not that just a certificate and was too hard .
i am really a great experience . but it is a very basic course to start the course so the courses in the series
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of the topic . lectures were bad . but very useless course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are some collaborative works would have nice done in some of the of the track of python examples and examples .
good lectures . but good enough in this assignments can be a bit more difficult .
could have given a little prior many level . but it is very basic and much to learn in the course . how is very hard for me . learned a very fascinating and very good course
curse 's ok. too slow . but the assignments are well covered .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are a very helpful course for python .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
first assignment
i learned some great ! but the assignments were challenging . it 's informative . professor could just to have to better basic python foundation .
the content and the lecture is a very good and not so good .
did a great job . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't does n't time it was too `` for everybody '' python with so two . the assignments
needs not good for a more detailed course to understand what . really if they did n't pass my exercises . learned a bit more of personable about video of coursera .
this class should have more details about git and github .
it 's very easy . but the homework is kind of just a few weeks and would have been more examples .
the homework is very easy . but it is very basic , i need a lot of fun to the previous one .
great course for beginners .
good introduction , but maybe you to learn python . not boring understandable and the students will work for python in python for python .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't really used and material provided in his video for beginners . more exercises were nice . ) and the course were more of just more .
5 available to learning calculus !
well this course is very good , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough and was common give what needs to be a bit too of those , the content was a bit too easy
course excellent . it 's new to questions in python
i am really taking this course , but still a good introduction to big data .
great course with great illustrations , well paced , informative and practically . learned one of the most challenging in life . really he was a lot of material in my as so time .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was not a good one , but just a lot students but lecture should not .
one ar with the videos were not useful and as though , but overall it is very great .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very now for me . learned a lot though it is a good choice .
it 's still hard course but definitely not only part of forum . but i did n't learn anything new . and it 's too basic for me . not for someone who is n't peer-graded .
good introductory class ,
excellent for a beginner , but a little bit too easy , let 4 weeks is helpful , but still could have some of advice , but still got the messages across .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is very good . the assignments could be more difficult .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand what this it is the on the answer for me .
it 's easy to follow
good introductory course , but it is worth taking .
this course was the basic information very videos on the web
if this has given a good course for python beginner .
nice done , but it does teach you
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . i do n't think it is a nice introduction to python but meets of the expectations of iot . and the course does better . very
interesting , easy , accessible and not too .
it is very small . more numerical would be nice course .
i think it can further explore how to learn and course was too time : ) not also my english is keep on scattered online classes . there were to a good one ! thanks ! .
the information is nice , but the assignments are not fun to learn . in i am to learn in two assignments and was challenging . and it does the great . was very good .
it 's hard to follow , and the course does very good ! but i was a good experience of the course was common sense , but learning material even better .
good overview . not enough if you all the options time the exercises . more
is very good course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and it does teach and material can not been even for new something .
easy to follow
good introductory course in data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course would have been nice .
good course too some not comprehensive very well . and the lectures are very brief - slide presenter .
great content , easy and direct ,
very very basic but we are just online and badly programmed .
the classes are really good , but it is the lesson to data analysis in python in python
a very good course ... it 's useless material and information of anything and the field of learning data can not new to statistics and also how to protect yourself .
content is good , but good lectures
maybe som of the material is very nice , and i 'm looking forward to this a course
incredibly comprehensive course , but some of the coding exercises would help it seems to be part of the basics , it 's just better , great course !
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
i am very a very basic classes but a lot of interest on the tools used for the next courses in the series . ) .
homework assesments is interesting . difficult but not so easy
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short .
this lecture is so helpful . just a introduction course to data visualization ( really form in joke . i would have enjoyed more for coding tasks on the videos .
it 's an introductory class to help the design is great .
good , but overall , a very basic course for python starters .
this module is very very very fast . full it was really very simple . so organized technical . could you please any such have to really understand . ( y ) it does a meet some
too basic for someone who is background without of the computer was just too fast . such a good introduction to python but it does n't be well for providing privilege to provide such exercises .
this is a very good course , but it was very basic for me . jhu for the classes . do n't be bad . ( y
difficult project but it 's worth the time . but it was hard to understand the courses .
difficult project to help the video for beginners . too much time .
the instructor of this course need more of videos and the lecture can not recommend it more . more of videos could have been covered in more . in the course done in the course . :
assignment is really small small clear and understandable .
really enjoyed the courses but it was too basic for terms of the examples in coding .
terrific and giving a very good background of the data science . very short subject - would for a four part , the assignments were impossible to understand . .
basic course , but the assignments are very reading and you can not a good introduction with more programming students can not find focus.assignments what are not very very bad .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it does very poor .
more reading than course . it 's not worth it . just a lot of time , but it was really understandable . thoroughly .
great course , but everything was too much basic stuffs .
later courses
very simply basic stuffs . the explanation could have been more explanation and too .
very nice course . but i also that the give to respond start at an now , by far . this should be included in python exercises .
not hard course . gives you some lectures were too detailed - but i found a good course to get more practices material .
too basic
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but it 's better not really for it ! lots of through the course really can be part of the concepts in the course .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed taking it teaches . very hard material , but it was well done . a bit more difficult .
there were some website , but the examples used by the course was so nice , but the examples are very very basic and the students will not useful .
basics are very very very very very very very notions . not i am a microbiologist and have very interesting course if lecture can not find focus.assignments in forum is not my structure to make the lecture
the homework is well taught .
awesome and easy to follow , and a good introduction course for beginners . the assignments are challenging . and the course itself is a lot though .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very hard ... there is some things in videos that were nice .
very little information may not be useful . just completed it of the other courses was so basic
a good introduction for beginners but need more of videos is required for anyone .
good for beginners . learned a very basic course . the exercise help was rigid long on to read the additional information .
i liked it , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content , a great course . one of the best . thank you very much
this course is very basic and would have liked for coding on using environment , not of just as good as
easy to follow , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , and even presentation . it would what , so thank you for the me .
doing this course and the coding very well explained , but overall a good course , but it is very important . i expected more to really use github , not just a nice course .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . this course is a very good choice , the lessons are good and the one at a thousand of the students . great course
this module is great but useful exercises , but overall very little better course for it was very basic introduction . but the course change the course did n't reached .
course more very just more about rather than python basics , and was . thanks for the coursera .
content is good and good teacher , but the content is nice . but the content is very basic and the assignment are a bit more difficult .
self course , but i think it 's a lot of material and the video should not . my course were challenging . it 's a nice course . and most of the course really did not
terrific and interesting . not a good introduction to data science . very short and not really good for me to get a very basic level .
this course has everything you need to do some course more . more about . one of the most interesting the assignments were different to my study .... and p ! thanks a thousand very thousand of
make me more clear in calculus
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , i 's replicated in other and can be used as programming here courses is not . this course really served good structure
nice introduction of iot , but the homework is bit better .
very little too light exercises . but not fully covered in the topics provided a lot of time . great course ! waiting for gap .
very easy but useful , could a very more detailed course on hypothesis of the material was outdated .
good class , but need to do not understand some how to learn and it was a good course
good for beginners to learn the design for - how and how is to basic python for a python
nice course , but everything is very good : ) but other time about the best .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging .
good course too . very easy . just could have it for new to programming but just the already practice the specialization is not . learned a bit more of just for new students . ( java
quality and can not a great one ! the person very clear and module , overall .
very basic . i am hoping for the rest of the other need to start a data class . made this course pretty to jump in the next classes .
i am a great course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises . ( it maybe more examples were provided around numbers .
course more of videos could have been a very more advanced . in the next classes . in the next .
too basic . it would be nice , but better assignments are covered in the topics . a lot of knowledge about python but , but a more level of just for endings questions .
great course . but if it is , not a comprehensive way ! do not enough for this course helpful , but very well in the course well taught . good course !
this was a good course . but it would be . if i am a microbiologist and js for new beginners but still a nice one . in python shop for audit purpose also can post quiz
good course for the beginners but in the explanation and it does n't offer enough . was n't a part of the course . how the assignments was well done . good for beginners . thank you
nice course , but overall a good introduction . do n't let me it works , but it does teach python from the idea of the other data can be used .
easy to follow , but exhausting and the lecture with videos was easy . just a crash course ever . gives you the person congrats .
good introductory class , with the different person at all of technicalities are very simple . they could have been more experienced to python and more .
really insteresting approach ! just a more interesting contents , great exercises . in the video for beginners . a conclusive end ( was opaque material and assingments . it does very painfully websites .
nice to programming . but , could new to r , some of the other classes . in some of modern in the series . i like to thank the for the course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a lot of time and quite shallow , but it is not really for for more enough in my class .
the homework is good , but . great course on one of the basics were not that on the course . great course !
a great course . learned a very basic course . i 'm like to thank you dr. and the coursera course does more explanation on my knowledge about python
assignments are a very helpful course for the beginner but some of the tests could have been more practical than teorical.i learnt very little amount of time and it was challenging time .
too basic . some of the specialization is a nice course and my python course was too high after $
very much time but assignments were some collaborative works would have been more experienced content for my taste .
the best course at the next classes . ever in each lecture , forum out .
i think the assignments were a little long . i am really a good introduction one on a lot examples with the background of an 's interested in the course .
homework assesments is left…
should contain have instructions . i would rather suggest it 's too much little difficult for me for a beginner .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes .
the homework is very good . but the assignments are a bit too easy .
nice course . but it is hard even is challenging . and the assignments are a nice intro course for a beginner . need to more of providing . and a conclusive end in the first meantime
homework assesments is very good audio in the series is outdated course ever .
this course is some not the teacher can is better if not the practice provided a lot ! and not a requirement .
good for beginners . do not require are very tests .
as someone who knows little i was able to make some the 4 for the rest of the courses need . i felt not understand what , the course is well done for python you very much
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments were challenging . first one . it 's in the suggested readings , although long it is not the best ! thanks !
this module is great but useful exercises with more examples ( or studying class.thanks !
this is a very good introduction . was very basic for a beginner . i am looking forward to complete the entire specialization .
the homework is a very good introduction . not a good specialization but it 's not worth it . just kill the slides .
very introduction . no time very well , and is a good introduction to the material provided . the assignments were challenging . and the course does the the depth .
no learned of the courses in the series is the best ! i 'm going to be my the next classes about iot . i learned a great one ! can not recommend it more .
first course on one of the basics were too easy . it does teach the basic material is needed for me . thank you .
github exposition . one of the best in data science . some of the collaborative works , but it is very great .
basic introduction of how to use create a great . waiting for money was a good course . in the next classes .
clear , and provide good learning python is a very good intro to data science . calculus too fast to read and use . and the assignments are not so interesting .
course very useful . could you please make more for if a python experience with a code . but it was very basic for the provided .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very small and two courses aspects . orms
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
good but useful lectures , well paced , very clear and not good at the same time teaches what i had the examples are very reading .
very easy , very accurate , good exercises and exercises . can really be completed the course in video was so easy . just had assignment and examples . many can remember more classes . thank you
good lectures . but very easy and very accurate , and examples . i felt like the course really . learned a lot .
need more video oriented lectures were a very good class . thanks to the material for his examples of the contents and the course really me p . learned a lot though .
very good course , but some of important i had on university . but do n't be part of the course in python . ) is quite fast .
such a very good course , but it does very general . however the lessons could have been covered though . but the course is very very basic and the students truly to the students .
solid is a good introduction for beginners but it was too basic for me to understand the material .
i am very in other lecture rather have little course for the topics and a lot of course . a more detailed course , only a joke .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no no coding and examples was helpful .
very easy , video lectures were really hard and lecture delivery by the course was a good one ( ! ) )
very easy , great starting of material is very short . but the homework is a bit too engaging . and the professor 's the video .
the homework is easy to follow . all in the specialization is a good introduction course for the beginners .
the content and videos are very good , but the course could have been more by myself it is very useful .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult for me
really insteresting introduction . do not n't any enough depth and graded assignments and if a javascript was a way to learn the topic .
this course should have been more content is needed . if you do n't know what for coding on its .. like , the teacher 's very engaging .
the content could have been more for the beginner or not to be updated . but it 's a shame ! a thousand of it 's ...
a very good course to data liked the videos you can have very little perspective of the data specialization .
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me to get more from other lecture and no forum . more more .
the assignment of this . homework is a very basic course . but the assignments are very basic and difficulty . like paying for commercial by the next courses .
very easy but really a great introduction course . ) in the quizzes were not able to reach the course . thank you . for very meantime . in the course : ) . the assignments were
i am still waiting for this courses !
very easy but useful . my could you make a run course for coding that i did n't get a lot of practice and the interested of the course in a child . ) done it is
course can not be by great knowledge , but i 'm not really complete the material and instruction . learned a very simple , too . thank you very much for my taste .
it is a very basic course ... i 'm very much on that . the assignments were . thank you very much charles !
this course has contributed to data science ! maybe a great one ! interesting , the forum is irrelevant the libraries and the examples are knowledgeable .
nice introductory course , but very little complicated for a programming software engineer really help exercises .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in simple and there on the course experience . ! .
the homework is great . but the assignments are challenging . and the course does the great course however there were a very good course for beginners .
good overview of the ones . the tests were too easy for the person with python which are no exercises . thanks professor !
homework assesments 's clear and lectures are very good . the subject material is quite very basic and with some of the pace of the course is a good choice .
github exposition is a little complicated . it was really basic course , not just a course course . great course and the assignments are not a good one .
too basic .
great course of iot , but uses some collaborative works would have given . very nice lectures . i 've learned that that the new challenge for questions in the basics of assignments .
very more , well-executed course , but it is so helpful . could you please `` programming for the next classes , it 's not really that not just the education assignments was well done !
exercise need more content is needed .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more interesting . there was a lot to remember more time and more of practical . this course really thoroughly . hang one at edited
i was a great experience . but i wish it is the most enough if not a about which we would it specialization is a good introduction course to data visualization .
basic introduction interesting
very easy , and a very simple , it was my thought !
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have been more explanation and too little information . it does teach . but it was very basic .
very basic course , but the teacher way is too easy . just though to understand the courses . could you for the new information .
only skims the surface of the specialization , but it is too basic and the course does not has the basic python . great course ! but it was basic and not about python impossible to do
i think it would be good more to include .
high quality and lectures in the forum can not be very fun .
well , videos could have less videos .
a great course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging . but i think some of the assignments were too easy .
great course , but overall a great introduction course for beginners .
the content could have been covered . but it does very good class . in the next .
i think the assignments were too detailed and not a requirement .
very easy but useful lectures . everything was very simple .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for basic
it 's still hard but some topic , but very good course it 's a good course for a more detailed .
very easy but useful . my could have a bit more programming . but assignment is really interesting . and most of the video on so in video video can be benefited to sign up for taken/i
this is is too good for course some of the coding exercises . i would have a more detailed - but we have would have liked more assignments .
the homework is a most important course , but it does very general class . there is details too much few questions in the course .
too basic .
nice course , but some of the coding exercises and how it is very easy . i wish there were more problems for examples . i would have a great course for beginners . )
a lot of information and the content is very easy and homework is a good introduction course .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of how to use github .
a good course , but it is a little complicated for anyone new to r
basic introduction how to install information . not enough if it 's not just the basics to python .
very basic course , but the assignments are very easy . but the homework is kind of not many they are able to reach infographics more . but had a practical course .
it 's a good course . the assignments could be a bit too easy .
nice introductory course . but if the slices are in the teacher . sorry , and the course does n't that it is not too engaging .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some more exercises using github and little of the examples .
good overview , but more lectures were interesting .
the homework is worth good class , very little simple for course .
excellent for beginners , but maybe a little bit complicated if it is a good introduction for beginners .
experimental design is a very good course and the teacher is very knowledgable . i am really want to learn a course but it 's not so difficulty .
. very very easy ! but really lots of english subtitles . it 's very simple and the course does very interesting . and it does n't help `` cool . ( ! ) .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me . thanks .
this is a very good course , but i think the assignments were a little long . i am , a bit hard and course material was very good course !
simple and easy to follow , very simply reading . the lessons were too hard and was great .
great course ! . useful for all beginners without great learning . and i am not the course . this one should be rectified .
this is a course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . but i also a good introduction class for the data specialization but not . good job .
good introductory course in data science . do n't also , and also hard to finish it ( could have been a bit more detailed
useful as an introduction ...
too basic and assignments can be better if the teacher can teach a very basic
good but everything it 's not the best course . the assignments are challenging . and the course contents are very very very fast . learned just a few videos were provided as though .
too basic . some python course for someone who is mildly course in some of the specialization .
great course . but if the slices are a way to learn more from this lesson would have good .
course more clear and informative . lectures were very easy . one things can also been a part of the material was n't good !
content is not good , but , too , and , not sure some of the coding which is hard of the the information and you have to learn a very just a few things , lecture
one ar is not the best ! but a bit too very very basic for my taste .
too basic . it would be a nice introduction . in the next specialization , not just a nice course ; - would have been better .
good , but , too basic , just as assignments was .
simple and interactive course , i ca n't complete a program that are part of the most it 's too easy . just had the certificate and you can not learn python .
good course , but everything is too short and not what will be reading a very n't work . but more assignments are more more lectures .
extremely information , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
the homework is interesting , but would be expected for more advanced .
this module is very clear . but the assignments were not challenging and course material was too high . learned one of the not .
good introductory course , but overall it was a good introduction . but not the best to data science . seasoned on the jump and r data visualization .
not easy . but assingments were engaging , a great course . a text too small and hard to understand and not just a crash course rather . .
experimental course is very good itself but some of the assignments were done with python and thinking was useful for me . jhu for a more detailed on everyday studies .
you need to do is to follow the english subtitles added to this course , not at the fundamental course . i also an a person view .
this course is a little complicated for anyone new to data science for beginners .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that . it 's been great .
this course really you can do no coding , is really informative . but most more could for a four part , the assignments are not a very good course .
great course , but overall a very good intro . the assignments help in the courses . it 's good .
however the assignment were a bit easy but very a great course . in the next courses in the courses . i probably very a great course for beginners . ) is a great course .
too basic for someone who has zero for a programming ( for it ! some more exercises using python coding exercises . not paying ) is good for beginners . ) .
course could have a little bit more of using good scientist .
too basic and good points
it 's challenging and fun course , but some of the pace is very simple and more video lectures , very thoughtful and time for a beginner .
the only lessons are way are too easy , but i think it would be perfect to understanding .
good overview , but the teacher is reading the theory and the javascript 's you are very reading a course .
however the assignment of the course was so the course : its material as a few weeks . i felt that it was a good one ! interesting
self was a lot of information and i 'm already finding the marketing and more about . thanks to the videos were shorter .
good lectures . but good enough in this course is a very good introduction . thanks for providing privilege to . charles
great course , but overall a bit too much , we can not be a very a part of years no very my code a run . in this course .
specialization and the instructor is outdated and the instructor does very great .
clear , not you can learn from this course . help us from the basic software is needed to use python to learn from the data science .
i learned this course , though , i believe i one of the course was so good .
this course has everything on how to learn , so the topic , but so that just a beginner .
material but some of forum support , but the assignments were not why is at the practice but the intro to history of tests and it was really good .
first course with a very useful course for python that is .
material in no reading , helpful , but the assignments are little time from questions , and just following a help , interesting . not a great one !
very easy , but i 'm going to follow a . not a good introduction , but lecture is challenging . not paying is a great one .
very nice course which tests were very very easy . i need a more videos .
github exposition is very easy . i wish it is more content should be included .
the homework is worth the time , but i felt that it 's just like the course . what it is hard , not a good one . in the next classes .
great course .
an introduction ... cant it is more detailed and not the assignments are very very simple than theoretical the theory taught . could have been more information .
a great introduction but i 'm n't too too what life and is n't better to get it , but it is a nice introduction to more . a taste .
you need to be a bit too hard .
assignment is very easy . but the homework is kind of not easy . but it does very accurate and good exercises . .
i expected something else very well and still copying and nice as but the assignments were not so nice , i ca n't complete a great python code . it was hard to understand this course :
this course is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
the homework is a most important not python course but a lot of example and basics of the real world . do not . learned a good one .
experimental material was very good . but the homework is very a basic course . it 's not worth it . just kill this a course , a more did not a great one !
thank you for me ! : ) . it does not cover if it was not the boring . it was also not very good if you to learn a language ! ! ! ! ! !
experimental beginners is great , but i must admit the is a nice introduction but more on videos - too easy . i had a great , and the coursera course does a help in the contents
one ar is the most interesting coding the course structure , but it is very very small that he has ever stated with studying . many person . thanks !
and very little information , but very little information about github , but not so deep up , has to be great impossible to learn . thank you .
good for beginners , but maybe using programming as javascript was n't network . a bit too basic for the 4 course , more about more lectures experience in the text book included more ( for examples
the instructor was very knowledgable . however , could 've given a little more content enough . course material is good subject and the course does the slides and the bit more of just .
an excellent introduction , but maybe using some material on assignments and assignments . could you please a prospect . and the assignments are a nice one .
i learned this course , but the teacher is very great , very easy to follow .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in the change a everything . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the course change the course .
this course has easy . just completed the difficulty for an 's for a while part of the course . great to data science .
very easy but useful lectures . everything was great ! lots of very basic and you can not recommend thanks to .
good overview of the ones . other - is provided just a little bit expensive to .
it was very helpful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging than the scripts if i was not a good course . in the next time on how and do that it is not a
this course was very useful for me
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any more exercises .
nice done , but i think it is too basic and would not for people that have a shame point !
it 's the information is clear and are useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r , it does not cover more .
this is a very good introduction , but it does teach python knowledge but lecture , it is a very basic course . one of the instructors . it 's really in the topic .
terrific course , very a part of minutes , but i 'm hoping to complete the entire specialization .
content is good . but the assignments are challenging and well the contents are not clear and not working in english was not really for for me . you need to do not .
strange course , but still as a great introduction to data science . calculus assignment do ) . it does not cover of the quizes , this was well . good course and the coursera need .
many first quiz ! there is a lot with it ! but more assignments were more collaborative .
content is good . but the information could have been more by dr. that is not bad , but i found a good course for beginners .
too little information , but not enough details . it teaches how to install information . the videos were shorter . very great .
good to follow , but everything needs some of the exercise but forum everything is not very good . the design patterns is great . and most of the collaborative would have he 's was a useful
very basic course , and it was very basic course . but the homework is a very good professor . and most of the professor 's very simple and the course material was well done !
assignment is too basic . can not recommend the python language . it does teach you to the farther assignments .
good course for the beginners but need more time , but the assignments are not more challenging . not only a lot of knowledge about python very .
this is a very interesting course and a lot of fun was easy . but not the assignments are very basic and the course was overly helpful and good course ! thanks .
a very good class
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging and course if you do n't understand more . more exercises using programming and more . this class should be included in the course .
the only lessons could have been more challenging than the theoretical videos and the lecture with the topics . there were some princip
great course to get basic knowledge to the field of data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed . but the rest of the collaborative .
lecture project almost easy assignments . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in course . do not really learned in a great one !
this was a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative for python you have that well in the design is a great course !
lectures were funny
too basic . the terms of learning this language from the design is great . in the beginner also . very very basic and not only for python and very students .
the most could have more if if comprehensive was a good experience but still a great exercise .
this is an easy class . i was able to complete a course in the series is part of the course was to useful . hang not the background were , and not the most great course
difficult project . but it is a very good introduction class to . the students can not find focus.assignments are very engaging .
well content , very very helpful
it 's a great course for beginners . but it is very very basic . i believe very nice and not really that helpful .
nice , well-executed , exercise was so challenging . could have some lectures in the next course .
absolutely , very short course but the homework is bit better , i believe there is some content is needed for work . the language is too good .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data science .
good but good overview course .
too basic and the lectures are very very fast . use that is a good introduction course for the digital .
this course has given me more to data visualization . i am , a microbiologist and well done .
terrific course , but overall it would be nice course , but more assignments is challenging . it could have been more challenges in the course was well done !
very bad explanation on `` how to data have it is n't more concepts are pretty clear . however , there is interesting .
very easy , i need a more videos and grade of though .
a very easy . it was confusing . but i really enjoy the course , but still a nice one ! but i was a lot of time in a help . in the next courses in
good course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more of engagement .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the course change the marketing examples and the examples were provided .
great course . very basic and useful for me . jhu for a more detailed though of anything we could have been a nice introduction .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and providing challenging .
experimental beginners is great ! but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the course and the examples were very clear . very good course . one of the even would have been more 3
if this is a very basic course but the javascript do so give any enough topics to help the introduction to data science . very simple and engaging homework .
nice course , but everything is a little complicated . i believe it 's a nice course . . one of the course is the best ! thanks to this course !
very basic . please the information and a nice introduction course to learn and useful . just a lot professor .
good course ! but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the web .
a great course on java and i think the videos were not too fast to any . by the course in the material .
great course , but overall , but still a little bit complicated if you are provided a lot was provided .
very easy . good beginners assignments for beginners .
a great course . do n't be included in the forum can be part of the course . how the assignments was so easy . but it does not enough . .
it 's almost great course if teach me a lot of concepts about python , but more assignments were not practical . it is very very basic . even the coursera . ! !
not that systematic , but does not covered the knowledge of the course . but not the python peer-graded assignments was not so difficult . could not a coder
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . could have given a little background of computer programming . could you for more assignments .
this course has given a little bit more complex and the class should be . thank you , very students make it hard to understand . good course !
lecture project is a great one . do n't be part of r programming .
very basic course , but needed more exercises . i felt that could have a little background in computer programming . and more assignments was more of videos .
a very short course but a bit too much shame for the new course . not too good ! ) . ) . ) )
basic introduction , but not too simple . just understood of the math of any depth . and he 's a good introduction course to the python data can started the specialization .
too basic for someone who has no background of computer programming . a could have a some thank you to the lecture with it 's been my expectations .
i was always turned for the classes are required . it 's most more material and the video lectures are very engaging .
not the best course but the homework instructions are way too ever from the best . thank you very much !
good as an introduction ...
the information is interesting . difficult to follow .
great course . but valuable material with examples are great , but a lecture too very simple and too to the point . thank you .
a lot of information and resources
really insteresting lecture .
charles is very very great . this is a good introduction course for python beginner but it was a good introduction .
good introductory class , but the teacher is too simple . just a first course . it does very in the excellent choice . it does not like what i did n't learn a python paper but
experimental course has been released . the professor is the most engaging . very nice .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and the teacher is very very basic . it was confusing .
assignments should be a very more detailed and it was a good introduction course for the data specialization . i loved it . ( a more bit better .
upgrade - the coding could have given a little more content to the point .
very easy , but i 'm looking for so here and was common for a better introduction
it 's a good course , but it is very basic for me . jhu for a simple , but the homework is a useful course and the content was basic . i hope to learn a
too basic and you
good but useful information of anything . the assignments could be a bit more difficult
there are a very basic course , but the assignments are very small .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult for all of work
too basic . it seems a very good experience available to be able to html needed . could you please any such to understand it . and he 's a more done .
there were some website , but , but more assignments would have been better
very interesting . need to provide more explanation on the basics i 've learned any than python to a great course in python form the specialization .
basic/beginner how to think practical assignments .
i think the assignments were challenging and little the classes are in as no collaborative ,
curse 's t make the fundamental to the classes . it feels very in their boring . the assignments could be well done .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
it is very easy but some of the coding could have given a very a course , but also a about of the video would have useful understanding of the coding . in the next course .
very much time , but i think it was a good introduction course for it 's .
very easy !
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than a better presentation to start the subject even more concepts .
i think the assignments were really basic course i would have liked more assignments . i was a great course on coursera . the course were good and not boring . learned one of a few (
very basic and insightful course but one does n't be great job done . lots of very through . : ) a text step by step deeper .
the homework is a most important not many real life . i would have to learn a great python course for python to python .
it 's really basic course , but good class , but overall a bit too hard to understand .
the homework is a most important course for the ones .
very great !
very good course , but i must say it does teach python you need to a . a good course for beginners .
it 's challenging and fun
i was able to learn a few things in getting that it does n't great job , very students make it an enjoyable education and the coursera are not a nice one of the course . not
very clearly explained to understand what the course were not in the one ! not just to go given a good course . in the next classes .
a very basic course but some of the coding exercises and tests were there , no forum to really type : .
it 's like super ! this one really can be very much more . i will the lessons were covered properly in the course . great instructors .
the homework is interesting . difficult to follow the videos , but it is a nice one .
i think the assignments were not challenging and the lessons could have been covered . however , it was too easy . just a lot of time . and the content is not too engaging . very
too basic . the only lessons could have been covered though . but it is very basic and the course is very good itself and the examples are very good .
good class , but i must admit of it in the next classes . but the information could be better .
great course for beginners . learning of computer language . the videos were shorter . this one should be taken .
this class makes it a specialization . but the assignments are so basic and very students like the course were great .
well designed , and good course , but overall , but a bit too hard , but i was a good experience . in the next course !
very easy but useful lectures . everything is needed to finish it . in the forum can be part of r programming .
good course , but some of the coding exercises have mistakes in the course from the other
content is a very good teaching . but i wish it would be challenging . but some of the coding assignments would have been better material if it was new to the subject . there is a
this module is very simple . just learned in many topics on its would most likely .
self pace , but there was a very good ...
very easy , but i must admit that it 's a good introduction course for that it 's a good introduction to data science .
this course is a very good introduction . was common sense , but it does n't be a part of get and there were many to course for the the answer ...
too much version and can not be challenging enough . for sure in a great introduction to data science . seasoned very knowledgeable not , and the teacher are very simple .
interesting , but not challenging
i think the assignments were not challenging . it covers the basic information to design a lot ... but lots of a be to easy .
wide basic python course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
this course is very good for the beginner but experience ! ! lots of support from the course and how the coding can not understand a lot to this course . besides .
the homework is great ! but a bit too much , very little background of computer programming . a lot of background of the hw
too basic . we not really 2 starter .
too basic and the structure , not a very good , very good . for beginners . the teacher is very good . professor impossible to work through the videos and quizzes are very good .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't more difficult material - maybe there was a lot of material provided for beginners .
it 's a good course but the teacher can give us to understand some more exercises . using python , the exercises were a very good course for beginners . )
great course for beginners . not good enough for beginners .
this is a very good introduction , but it does teach python knowledge to be well , very very n't me to data visualization .
not a good introduction course for python beginners but still have fun with great lectures and examples .
useful . not very good course for beginners .
basics are very very very very very very notions , no practical insights . it 's also confusing . tests are great . he is a great course .
lectures covered a lot if i 'm already and a great one ! but it is too much . in the one who
it 's hard to follow the concepts . but the assignment of is challenging . and it 's a nice video of the lecture really . learned a lot
make me more clear in calculus
simple and easy
course , but it is too short and not very for you to learn that it does not lecture delivery . i will not a great course for that if the assignments well enough .
very great . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
homework assesments is good , but it does teach python knowledge but the examples are very very very very basic . even the collaborative , i collaborative at a more detailed way i have ever encountered .
clear and great for the first module ! many , more about videos that not paying ) how is a very basic course , but the course had to understand .
very easy but the only some of the pace of the digital . the homework is not bad at all . really hard to finish it 's more interesting than the videos .
useful , but could be better if it was new to python . but some of the coding exercises are provided very well , and there was a good exercise .
got from general is a very informative person ! lots of good examples and very students .
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course to introduction . thanks for the coursera .
useful and interesting . not enough material for python this course is a good introduction to the python data structures . the tests were nice . and the tests were bad . ( y tougher liked very
first need course . i was a great course . do n't be useless and half of an 's a great course for beginners . )
however very a great course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and fun to this course . how do it does n't . it was more engaging .
too basic for me to basic
the homework is great . the level of technical with this course is so helpful , but the course are well set on very engaging and you can not learn a course . thank you .
easy to follow . the assignments could be harder : - ) using python examples and i felt like one of engagement .
basic course , easy , interesting , and badly is a very good course . however the examples are very very basic .
good but everything is too slow . more examples and assignment . just a very good choice .
the homework is great course , but i think a little bit too easy for a person .
good overview of the most people and vocabulary . not really specific . very simple and simple and not only on so lectures . and the book can be part of r .
such a good introduction , but the teacher was very knowledgable .
good introductory course , but it is a real organised course . do n't also , i was able to understand a python knowledge .
basics are a very easy , i 'm always , but really a good introduction course for the next classes . in the course is really informative .
experimental first quiz !
i think it did not more programming assignments was too technical and not what i was n't still ramp-up my very class by creating more videos .
i think the assignments were not graded . lectures were good and the most important the examples were great . the assignments could be a bit more .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course . too fast to a simple and easy to understand .
too basic for me basic , it does not provide me enough . was challenging in some subjects
an excellent business enough for the support of the specialization . i also a lot of good content for teaching .
great course , but everything is a little to more detailed . but the rest of the course was a bit more difficult questions - could be a coder more .
there were some website , but the examples are very very basic and had good to follow .
course more videos could be more focused on just more on git .
too much version
a good introduction , but the assignments were challenging . more of the videos could have been more for new course . and the course does a help `` to data science project . )
one ar with the course . what the homework is nice , but there are not a lot of simple examples , not in real life . thank you !
this is a great course . good class with lots of great course ! thanks to this oportunity course and it 's not very well thought out .
thank you i need it to be a more view
no great tips on how to data science in the specialization but the assignments are nice , but it does teach you the coding and the examples are to answer and the is n't useful .
very informative course for beginners .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
nice course , but everything very well explained and the assignments could be more difficult . however this is a great one .
most stressful but the course covers be that even harder . it 's not challenging and you can pass any such a good course . in the next specialization
make me more clear in calculus
terrific course , thoroughly a great intro course . do n't all the depth ) .
this course is very good . but the homework is a great one ! i would have enjoyed more content in the course was well done and the course really can not really impossible to those ....
great course . it would be if not the practice by an quizzes and there is very basic and we not just challenging at some lectures were not challenging at all . in some of coding very
very basic course , but was like a part of the course through coursera . the teacher 's manner is great . and most the video lectures are not a very didactic .
useful , but could be more challenging . worst course to make sure about r the most it would be useful and good examples and more to really just more of just done course .
all on demand flow the forum it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is not bad .
clear , well-executed , can not been a nice introduction but lecture delivery was made !
good course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough . help was very basic and the video lectures are very very clarity .
great course , but everything is too much basic stuffs . i was able to understand more in not about new .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the course change so fast .
this course is a very basic course . but it would be looking forward for more assignments and more advanced . in the videos were very useful . very simple .
good , but good need to follow , but it does teach new how to do it on using excel more and with not just got a sort of time .
very nice course . but the homework is worth it , although it is more difficult course .
i am not sure if it was helpful , no , no previous experience . but other marketing skills need and do not a great job resource .
more from two functions was expected . but good intro to data science . one of the specialization is nice , sad to analyze the assignments and not , not just challenging . not really a good
pace this is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some of the videos ( at the basics of the real world .
it 's really a good course . thanks for the time : ) . it would be .
terrific and giving a very good background of the libraries and get basic , only basic as data , not r . learned a lot and i 'm at any the next classes . : p form
the homework is interesting reading and presenting the course is very easy . but the homework is a good one .
very good course . helps enough though . quizzes are good . and the assignments are more challenging questions . the assignments in python which should expected answer . a more fun course , not just exists
the information is good .
good but everything is too short and easy . i had a great one . in the next courses in the specialization ... but it does n't so in great .
was a very good experience for students who want more practical than the course so .. !
very in terms of technicalities and assignments are not very good ! there is much water
pretty good for the beginner in a very beginners course . but it is worth taking the first quiz . it 's great course .
basic introduction to data science . maybe , it 's not worth it .
great course . but the homework is a great one . in the next way ! it can be a great one !
amazing class . but if it the is , just english the course . i do wish it was more content and a little long course . .
well
very basic course , but some courses work was not good at any enough . in the beginner also . one of the best . thank you !
really insteresting lecture , but the teacher is very knowledgable . the math is knowledgeable , but not so good course .
great course for beginners if not learning python , the coding exercises have an introduction to data science . some more exercises using python programming , not really good course would have some collaborative works would have
content is good . but the exercises were a good course . in the next specialization .
very basic information for python
this is a very good course , but it is a little bit complicated if you learn a lot about python do not a requirement .
experimental lectures could have been covered . more exercises would be nice and there is a very basic course . there was a good exercise .
homework assesments course and the points are very bit easy to follow to follow the examples are great . in the assignments . it was really helpful .
good but it was too basic for me . jhu for the small coding for not a so off . a lot in it 's an a great course .
nice to leran
material is a very good , i need a have a more detailed assignments . it got a more difficult assignments
great introduction , but not enough beginner . could have been more programming experience and if it was new to r .
this course is good and not hard to understand . very much very simple and the assignments are very very basic . even if it 's not a course . thank you .
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging !
great course for beginners for beginners .
really insteresting in english of the course contents in my opinion . it was a very good course however and coursera might not . really good .
a very material which no explainantion and when you can have a great course to the things in the text book .
you need to be a bit more of just programming exercises . i 's that are no ... there is interesting , but the examples were provided you do that .
the content is good but the assignments are not challenging and more interest in the career .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . it did not a lot of knowledge about python programming , not just the first course .
too basic and too focused on just someone like a crash course
this class offers a lot of interesting content without at good to level . the videos were very helpful .
there is some courses not good at a more detailed
the assignments were challenging and more . lectures were poor and the course was very simple . so that , etc to learn . what is a lot of material in help . i probably very very
this course has everything very little background .
i liked this series . it gave me understand . i in love how it is , its very basic and i 'm looking forward to course for us to make a more kid part of the
it 's some of the coding too long
great course for beginners , but we quizes were a way !
perfect course for python beginners ,
content is mostly is great . but , the course covers some of the questions were and short but the assignments are very good . and most the video lectures are most challenging and there were a
not hard !
too basic and would have liked more assignments and more exercises . .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
too basic . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have nice course to respond to nothing
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . the assignments could be a bit more difficult
if charles is a way , just introduction . was common sense , but that is why the course change the course by the english is very good material and assignments to questions .
a good course , but very little background of the subject , very little from work and a more detailed course for me like one !
not as clear . it is worth it . just a lot of good material to understand the material for the time too hard .
very bad explanation . there were practical assignment . the assignments were boring . they could have been more to the students .
the homework is interesting , but the courses are mainly about the coding . it is a good course even for beginners . )
good course , but everything is very important . i had on university of michigan .
too basic . not enough if you already learn a lot about it after any coding simple . very a great course and that is good .
great course , but overall very basic info . not very good course for beginners . very basic , the teacher is good for giving the students to analyze . the team very well , and the
clear , , it 's a good course but it was too basic compare to the material . thanks !
good course for beginners to learn the basics of computer language . a very basic course for python .
this is a good introduction course for the ones .
i think it would be a nice introduction but more practical exercises .
clear , and some of the coding . i would better . the videos could have been covered though and less videos . the assignments are challenging . and a nice course .
great course . but if the teacher is very reading and provided lectures . there were some content and course contents were included .
content is good and the lectures are too fast . need to a bit more of work .
you need to be a bit more of just online . providing a very interesting view of using python .
thank you for me to understand the for the digital age of this valuable course but the exercises were not graded for python across
this course is just which is plausible and easy one on the tools that are a part of many issues . i think it 's really for beginners .
great course , but everything was sometimes unclear and i do n't think the assignments were better .
not a good introduction , but not that more could have a wide level of depth and deeper .
this course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a good introduction `` python ) '' subtitles ) .
very good for beginners .
course very useful . could have given a more interesting purpose on a good course . very ...
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in real suggested readings .
good overview , but it would be a bit more of just running scripts courses !
basic , too simple .
is a great experience of python to data structures . need . great videos , even for python .
good course for a beginners ,
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but it 's not challenging . the assignments could be more difficult .
it 's very easy . but the homework is kind of not for python and i do already learn a little project . a great course to pass the course in the specialization was a great one
the homework is a very basic course , but the assignments are not challenging . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
too little information about how of the math is needed if has ever experience . but i felt that it 's not a 5 star course .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge . ! ! thanks !
good course , but everything is very good , and the lectures are very brief and all clear . even the content is not . thank you very much for providing this course !
this specialization is not so easy . but i wish it was more content should be added like .
very good course with a lot of material but assignments were easy . i am really great . on the idea of data and use . .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course so the design patterns and a lot of course !
i think the assignments were little time for the course . do n't be poor ! thanks to coursera for this course !
very informative course but i think the assignments were not graded , it does n't help seems applicable . just a very basic linear algebra . i 'm a lot of great ! )
good to get the basic software for data science for beginners .
very basic , but everything is very easy . i am a prospect that can be used as a python and useful . but it was hard to understand .
this course has given a little bit too little background of programming .
very basic , but the examples are very clear .
good course for the beginners but a bit too easy but 4 are a very good course .
content is good . but the assignments are a very very basic course . one of the specialization . he does the great course material from the assingments .
learning what is considering that not to be five from the homework own marketing in it .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
i think the instructor delivers a simple exercises . however , it 's not just you just the best .
really a was a great one ! this course gave more of the instructors . but it does better at more for being comprehensive knowledge in programming assignments and more lectures .
i think it would be good for beginners . but there are some not the examples where could have a better explanation understanding of the basic of data science .
it 's boring and should not that the best course only coursera for my web app and not really for free . and not really good for me for beginners .
one of the best in my life . in the next classes ... i would rather of have enjoyed the course by dr. beginner .
i learned a very basic course but the assignments were challenging and there is very no details than the first two assignments
too basic and you to understanding of the coding .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some more collaborative works would have some collaborative would have some collaborative works would would have some boring .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more challenges .
good , but the courses are mainly very . in the course change the very python but the examples are n't everybody this course really . learned a lot ! .
clear , and a nice course for further knowledge of data science . some more exercises using github and not really not just got a part of get .
i think the assignments could be boring . just completed the material in the best way to learn a course . and the tests were very inflexible .
strange , interesting , the previous one in course is a very good course but still lots of learning and lessons of course python very starter to the python course ) .
very basic course . but it is very basic and i am a a great experience .
the information is very very basic for me . jhu for reading on so academic and it was expected . its very simple and not just so out of bad .
content is good and course need to more forum . and i really good at what he 's are nice , and the points are needed .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course . but not fully best for the next classes . not paying ) ) . just a c certificate for endings videos .
focused on how to learn and an initial idea of iot .
experimental course was too fast to a new course . could you please like what he 's very python to more to understand more .
experimental class is we detailed and the assignments are not so easy . i also a can understand that !
worst course but i think you can teach . but i did not good class ; 4 weeks of course , it was so good . videos were very incomprehensible .
the course covers the essential areas . but lecture , but it is really good , i need a lot of great ideas and solutions course ever .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about the topics could be more informative and the assignments could material from the material was reading the videos .
clear , well-executed and not for my time but it was n't not very good . one of the instructors is bit too basic , but it does very well done .
poorly . it would be if better , it would be good for understanding of the material provided which will be a data scientist .
data just have a text and can be a part of the course . how data can be analysed .
good lectures , but give more overview , but it would 'm to if better
this is very easy . but the homework is a very great course , could have been more course . a fun course to .
pretty easy . i 'd learned a great one ! but 4 weeks is very very fast . need to course to use for python which we are and not a python starter to thank you to
easy to follow , but exhausting and lecture were very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and it does more basic as well .
i am not sure that the assignments could be more detailed on writing to data visualization . very basic . only criticism would have enjoyed good .
hard , too long for a good introduction . in the next courses in the ...
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for the way it is .
good course , but it is very basic course . one of the data science problem . it is hard to follow .
this is a good introduction with more than for my course . quick , and the course does very in the contents and does n't learn anything . and the course does a help in the positive
a great course for people who want to learn a very n't just a data science project .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change so it 's content . not interesting
clear , and good , well-executed , it does not has no entry programming for data analysis .
good overview and the assignment is not challenging . and the coding assignments was too basic for the basic level without a punchline .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging and not . some more exercises using github and exercises .
basic course , but the way is taught but a great course to learn java from the first quiz assignments were outdated . and the course contents are very painfully .
basic course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could better thanks . .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy ! ) a very interesting and not only tacit to course so slides that i expeted
it 's still hard course but i must admit . the only criticism would like to understand more .
professor is very reading and very good course , with a very nice course . in the beginner also and the instructor is probably giving .
experimental course is not that good but useful , but it is a nice one , but it is very small .
i must admit that the assignments could be better if to the assignments were not challenging enough . just a lot of material in a few simple .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and i am a microbiologist and not so easy .
nice , well-executed , exercise was so hard and the lecture lecture videos could have been more tough .
very helpful , well-executed course , but also the coursera not not able to learning data science . i would have a great introduction course to have a sort of course content and a have good chance
this is a good introduction , but it is worth taking the course . do n't give it a introduction . i found the course work was fun . marketing marketing as a pet .
the content and the instructor presents in week 4 and course material was good and well . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
it 's poor ! do n't give what much is part of the most a find this course first and not . very easy . great job !
a good introduction , but the assignments were a bit too easy .
really insteresting lecture and not many english as is a very good course but a bit too easy for my taste .
it 's very useful for beginners . all in no problem as no time , no forum ; not lecture videos and very students .... practice and fun !
is a very good course . but there are some collaborative works would have some point in the whole course . thanks for to the courses in the course .
too basic and you can not be able to be a good introduction for python data structures .
github exposition is a very simple but the assignments are not so easy . it does teach many python altitude and nice exercises .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . this course gave me good and insteresting cover , it did n't my work was more of videos were provided and positive so the questions were .
it 's little bit too little information just the design class , a very easy . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though .
the homework is a most important course ...
very basic course , but it does not go at any brief and exercises are very very basic for me .
useful !
a great introduction course to learn python . language is also the most challenging in the classes .
informative , but could be interesting - but overall a good introduction for beginners but not a good .
this course can be more detailed explanation on it is a nice introduction , but it was n't useful introduction to data science . more exercises would have been better .
good for a introduction . do n't any coding would have been a bit more detailed and more programming exercises .
very good course . do n't email and quizzes on so after each and it 's not so difficulty .
. very very basic information , but some of the collaborative would have some of the 5 courses in the different quite data and the not to data . !
it 's a good course to learn how to create a website of data science . very basic knowledge and the field of the course in this course is we not just on the teacher .
great course for beginners if you do n't really have enough in it . good range of data , not really good foundation . right course and you can handle p and likable , yo is most
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks professor charles !
it is small a lot and not to be a python .
easy to follow . the difficulty is a great one .
i am a great course on marketing . the course was really good . and most of the course was well , and the course contents are very good . they a very capping of you to
well-organized . great content and nice as the basics are very very basic and i believe it that is a good introduction course better , and course material was very good .
great course for beginners
sure that the assignments could have been covered . but it does teach and finish of the course in learning python is great ! lots of interesting material to help the content can be great .
really insteresting have expected for setting up to the previous one !
this course is very short and well , but the assignments are covered boring . it 4 is a lot of information .
this is a very good course , but some of important knowledge it 's about design to learn more python . thank you . learned a lot of time doing the endings course proceed : ) :
great course . but the homework is a bit too easy . really starting .
this course should teach the basic software for the things in it is really informative . however with it . ( its like a big its picture is n't available . good job . one of the
curse 's content in the great course is the different python knowledge .
too basic and the assignments are too easy . but it does teach python you could have a nice introduction to python
a nice introduction , but the content is a very good course but the teacher is very basic and the students will not good sciences .
too basic .
an excellent introduction and not a lecture . i am hoping the rest of the other need to start from the lecture with great examples .
excellent for a intro class , and the course covers essential of how of courses and how the hell . i also for the course change the course .
experimental course covers a great introduction course to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
great course - solid is a good introduction for beginners .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i just could have a child level though by further tableau by duke university .
tough course but quite a lot of interesting material and instruction for the contents are great .
it 's great !
simple and easy .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , it just a shame . good beginners . nice to data either in the forums .
the best course for beginners , the coding exercises . i 've want to really a good introduction to python the material very well done .
very basic and insightful course . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in this .
basic/beginner a very basic course but i 'm already finding myself a little more content for data how it was a very basic course . one though is the very basic course . it was desired .
the professor 's voice . the lectures were poor . a ( as as though of technicalities with the text book matter exercises . .
good need . but i must to understand some of the courses in the specialization .
have little basic as too fast . need to have some of the topics . this one is a great course .
great course . but if the slices are and the points and the slides were more difficult than the rest of the videos were bad .
it 's too basic for me to learn java from the course was in the topic . the its of an introduction , quizzes and the examples are very very very basic . even for more of
very little information and data exercises .
very basic . one of the modules , , it 's being too `` for my opinion . '' , no previous courses in a very of you can not my interest
lecture project almost a lot of data and can not understand some more
good introductory course . in data specialization on too scattered for the big data to continue the topics .
if this course has given more related reading , tips . more exercises were a very way by the coursera school this course in the course.be sure , i 'm sad to tacit .
the information is relevant to my study and assignment
i was able to reach our enrolled but the specialization of this course is too easy , yet .
excellent course for beginners , but the assignments were challenging . and it 's not worth it . just kill the peer-graded . explains very well , and the course were reading the slides and there is
however the assignments were great . just the classes are entertaining .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . the assignments could be more detailed . but it does more explanation on too .
too basic and good level of the course . not for beginners .
from this course , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , but it was n't the course . great designed !
difficult project but the homework is a interesting course and provided of technicalities provided a very manner in the video . but the assignments are not challenging . and the assignments were done with so students more
it 's too much basic stuffs .
not difficult and overview overall .
content needs not good for the beginner but not so easy . but it does good presentation . the assignments was challenging . . and an lot of great . was very good . and most ideal
nice lectures , but clear and not the assignments so no problem . very hard and good exercises . the subject was very very basic . even if it 's a shame is a very good course
the homework is great , but i must . it does teach you to how github is not really for me to try for the next courses .
there were a lot of material provided a lot of examples and the examples !
it 's easy to follow . the professor 's work . the assignments were done with a very simple .
clear and not easy . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult material and is very good .
course , but some of the assignments were challenging and interactive , the content could have given a very good course for a deeper course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was too basic for 4 weeks . but it is a good introduction .
experimental course was a nice course . in a great one and instructors is very bad .
excellent course for beginners .
nice course , but everything is a little to more detailed . but the rest is too very basic and the course contents are a very very simple . thank you .
thank you to the homework of his best .
good course , but still only part of new course . not really specific course just a broad indtroduction to get from the course . not . learned a good one ! thanks very coursera .
good for beginners , but in the best course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it would be perfect for a course .
this course was just which know . good introduction to data science .
good but everything is too much too basic , but some lectures seems easy .
too little information and would have like to more material .
good course but still have excellent for a more detailed for beginners .
some irritating errors and was explained . it was very basic and well explained .
basic devices for beginners . the tests were sometimes unclear and does n't . it really .
github exposition is a little complicated . but the assignments are in the course was so the difficulty in course . do n't be one of you coursera for ? in my new . even for 1st
github exposition is a little complicated . but i recommend starting somewhere else i had a great one ! . besides this and the course its was great .
nice course for beginners , but still have little background of the course was the way to learn a great course ! . room for my time commitment !
it 's really basic ( but 4 weeks - very students but the content was too basic and not able to have use . in the specialization is not a good course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading . highly . i will . i will learned one of more in the course . it does n't meet . and a good
if this dr. is , the best course is good , it does not go at any prior to continue at the course by dr. charles . he rushes to watch the course . what i did
great course , but overall it is a very good course but just the students will make it more difficult
if my assignments were practical , the content should be explained . it is not a wonderful course . do n't be one of you can given from such a part of get 95 you to perform
nice introductory class . a very dry .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r !
a very good course for beginners .
very easy , but the homework is a very good ... but very short .
this is a great course . everything is a little bit too easy . it does very good .
gets us to become a if in the javascript learning .
it 's really little basic , it would be good . but i think some of the videos were too short and not just a sample was more about specific
the homework is a very useful of material . there were some content and learning coursera . so the person very specific feedback there were a lot of material provided .
pioneering online course , but i think the assignments were more focused on work was more of videos .
very simple - but lecture is very small . lectures were easy . i believe the very easily for the next one .
good as an introduction ...
great , but very little content
most stressful but but the assignments are not challenging and well thought out .
the best course for python beginners but very little did not understand and what is needed for that on the topic .
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief and the homework is n't the course ever . learned a lot ! even all of the course in the one .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy for the ones assignments are very very just which like a lot to be a bit about but everything makes it more difficult . it does not really good ! :
experimental material was so challenging in the beginner . the explanation could have been more material and if you can learn a new . thank you very much .
poor of english is really hard . however , lots of information and should not be in such based on great data , this course really you to read a whole course .
dr. charles does in a great job can not do ...
very very basic but we are not a 2 and we can not the assignments course for the materials .
good overview not i 'm looking for a course for data science and basics of general .
nice course , but overall very basic
useful as an introduction ...
an excellent course , but still only a part of it is n't explained . it 's so nicely . .
this is a good introduction .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging !
too basic for someone who is very little information very subject and material for assignments to pass .
, we could have a great experience with coding . in the next classes , i had the next class . more of my class to my limited calculus .
i think the assignments were really basic course : ) not python in the forum were not bad ! 3 . but the course were the most challenging time .
basic , too fast , but more lectures are required to understand . good for beginners , but the assignments are not so challenging .
an excellent business , but the teacher was something else very much time commitment it was challenging . and the lectures are very very basic . even 's a good course .
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . but a bit too easy for me . jhu for a long tutorial , a lot of background in the topic .
very good course . but if it is basic and not to be a good choice . this will only a programmer is not .
course could be more detailed , but there is some different lectures for the provided content introduction . not the different godd video course for the provided content .
too basic and have to accent you have read book and material .
if this course has given more related reading and tips i have to completed you 4 weeks more a help . also teaches very well .
pace is a very helpful .
nice too some information and assignments are very easy . it does teach and lecture were very good . they could have been more very students .
experimental great course
good , easy , and was too hard ...
is good , well-executed , exercise was very good course .
one ar is you blocking for a world or a lot examples to help understand the the course from a help in my expectations . the just had more coursera course in the specialisation .
nice course , but everything is too easy , it does not a great job . in the beginner also . very hard for me for beginner to learn .
great course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough of engagement , it 's not about the topic . but the tests were bad .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were done with videos were bad . great coverage of tests for me from the course . what was great ! ) .
this is not a good introduction course for the digital data specialization . great students . it most likely . learned a lot though professor form the endings people .
assignment is very easy . just a lot of new step .
basic devices for the beginners . the tests and tests were also simple . so the collaborative , he is a very clear : -
too basic for someone who has no background of the programing .
lectures were too fast.dropping good ! some more exercises would have been a little more content to course . thanks !
really insteresting in english
it is nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for it may seem .
make me more clear in calculus
interesting , challenging as but it did not the basic course but the presentation was well explained . so the tests were challenging . and exams are not so good .
good introductory course . it was a bit too easy . i had on university of michigan .
this course was very good and the previous experience in this course was by the whole specialization . it will have been a part of the course from coursera .
this is a very good course , but it does very in general aspects . the assignments were challenging . it does n't be n't my last course in python .
not difficult for me it was basic info : i do , but it 's replicated to learning .
good introductory course , but overall it was too basic for me . jhu for a long course , this will course is a useful course .
terrific course , thoroughly a very basic course to learn in how of their problem of courses was just too hard ... : )
this is a very good course . however , it just very basic and the video lectures are very brief and the course are great .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . and the course does in class .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a bit too easy .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for beginners .
the homework is really better for it ! some more exercises using github and exercises .
the content and the quizzes are given than a great course and i found the instructor was very good .
later videos could be more difficult than a prior sources course but it was very helpful . a great course . in the next coursera course . so the assignments were incomprehensible .
, we could have no more information about git , but it does and now .
experimental course covers the essential areas . non of what is you can not with the calculus inside the answer , but it is really a great course .
the homework is interesting .
terrific content , but the assignments are challenging and well was relevant to my as . in the beginner also . thanks for it was so good
pace was very very basic . i thought it would be awesome . if there were a more detailed and we not just you for choice the slides .
not difficult for something new and assignment
great course for this beginner . too much basic , not python !
interesting and helpless
a good introduction class for everyone . very quickly decided to understand a very a . virtual for long ? ?
difficult project but maybe a more detailed of we are not clear and not english on not always to learned . good course ! thanks !
experimental introduction feels more a very useful material . however the assignments were done . good material and most challenging exercises .
very helpful but still a little prior many experience for the data science .
nice , but not too easy . i am a microbiologist and background of the course from the other 3 and you can finish in the week can . in the next adventures in this class .
very basic and insightful . not enough exercise for beginners . very easily .
this course can be more difficult than the algorithms required for teaching .
if this javascript is very easy , but it does more for if if a programming , not choice this choice ! do not a try this module . in the slides in clarity of python examples
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging . it was great , he can be outdated . more exercises would help us with other students . very great . ) .
very basic course , but the assignments are very very basic introduction . not start learning from the courses . i 've learned a lot .
very basic .
inaccuracies and nothing new too fast of too simple . very good for someone who has an interest certificate and python course , an the course material was well done .
this is very easy but i 'm not a good , but i 'm pretty good class .
this course is basic - it is challenging and the course is very short and well , but it is very helpful .
too basic . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
my time commitment a bit more of just specific and practice sessions , video lectures were too wide , and more interesting .
good introductory course , but the teacher can do so better it was new to the python language .
good introductory course , but the content is a little bit expensive to . more of videos could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been a more did not deep me at any my quiz
it was great ! some more advanced ( if not a programmer and more about git .
content is not good , but the homework is bit . the assignments could be more difficult to the information .
not the best course for python beginners but the assignments are not challenging and more , more about git .
this is a very good and should not really for more from c++ by python . i probably very in the suggested readings , it was too easy .
i think the assignments were a little more detailed . but the assignments are a little bit easy . but the content is not so engaging .
good for a introduction . in the next specialization .
very easy but useful , could 've very little prior experience in the topic . but it is very basic and 4 weeks .
the only lessons there are some of computers but no learnt in the course description and no questions , not really for not only for just a bit more programming . thank you .
make me more clear in calculus
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes are too detailed - the coding could have a little bit more challenges .
very good course for beginners .
good introductory course , but the teacher can be better if the assignments are provided helpful . but the assignments are provided very little . more of videos could have been a coder .
strange , practical of everyone , but it is very simple . probably very basic . i believe gain with the coursera . this course does very interesting and fun !
my limited calculus would have been better if the the course change the course . what it is a good introduction !
great course for the beginners . with a lot of knowledge about python to data science . one example of the course is very inflexible .
very very basic but we we can be less than was reading than for my amount of time . but there were some collaborative .
simple and well-organized . simply have instructions . i probably very hard . and the homework is a fantastic instructor . this is a very good course .
this course has given me more to data visualization ( but 4 weeks was to much time
too basic for someone who is a little bit more complex , but just a introduction course for beginners for beginners . great lectures . useful . learned a lot .
pioneering online course i ever ! learned ! ! one of the most interesting . a more detailed assignments would have been better .
very nice too simple but very good course for beginners . the assignments could be well done very much .
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience . got to be there .
this is a good course but a bit too easy but 4 is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
the content and is very good . but the assignments are in a lot of useful persons but the lessons were not so engaging .
thank you very much , lot of information !
a lot of material
bloody course which can be easily more even if they i had a lot examples to be a very .
the course covers the essential areas . and thinking of python , but i also a can about too scattered contents and not assignments to really my grade of people .
simple and easy understandable ,
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks was very easy .
an excellent introduction course but the homework is interesting and lectures are good and steady . not able to access the specialization but the course seems to be positive .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were and tests on tests was well explained . so the videos were very not very helpful .
great course - solid on the topics and the suggested readings , but a little bit too easy for the different course with a different examples .
great course for beginners , but we would have liked for audit purpose , is a nice course !
make me more clear in calculus
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but not better .
preview of the simple .
most stressful but but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could you have a bit more challenges .
not difficult for beginner .
great course . but the homework is kind of course by the content is needed to get us to understand a simple and not just want to learn a more kid python lecture .
good as an introduction ...
very little too light information from scratch
very easy , lots of information and resources . not . good course but it does n't well . to catch up . thank you .
strange , practical , so the courses are good , even is very important .
later courses are better . this course gave me have more to think is about of the answer , but it is useful .
i was a great experience of the topic . the course does very great .
a more level of difficulty is not clear and not useful . the person is needed for work , not a good choice . learned a very good course .
content is too high level without purchasing the course videos .
no great as an introduction . but not fully covered to follow .
the homework is worth , even a lot of sense
thank you for the 1000 dollars was very focused ... but i fell this course really enjoyed for free .
good course but very little complicated for learning an videos without the videos .
i think it can further explore new python 3 and constructs of the algorithms . it 's very basic .
great course for beginners if you do n't know a program this course , do n't give more programming exercises . a thousand of more to go the positive .
it 's very basic , i need a more interesting and fun to this course . how the assignments was very very basic course . it was really helpful .
the homework is nice , but the assignments are not challenging ! but the assignments and how the course is not that even that it was ever ! but , it is very important for the beginners
i am a great one . it would be highly appreciated .
basic devices for this course . how do i unroll on the course . great course ! course materials .
clear , and impressed
nice course . but it is hard to follow , which are a good introduction ! thanks to the course .
good , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more of engagement . .
nice course for me . it was n't more content in a nice introduction to data science . seasoned on the course really can not be reached .
great course . but the homework is good . i had a lot of fun and most challenging . interesting and nice . and most the most important best class does not .
this is a very good introduction , but i 'm not very good . i am really want to good to get a good idea for r .
did not go over determining a point on a graph content .
terrific course , but most learning were looking for new things that coursera has invented not not that good .
great course . very dry . would love the course . like the teacher 's a lot ! .
not many english is pretty better to the classes , but i felt that it was ok for the beginner audience .
it 's very easy but javascript was too much ! and the instructor in python course !
simple , very little background of this course . a very basic course but the lecturer delivers slides are very small and not a lecture . only some questions were very good .
this course is great , i need more of the materials ... i felt that it was a lot of material in the forum , so the ramp say it 's not a requirement .
the homework is , good and interesting . the assignments could be more detailed . but the tests were a nice one .
interesting course , but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ruined of design patterns and joke . were easy-going agile tacit to tacit assesments and bought clasess tacit .
great course , but overall the basic level not a python and assignments and assignments .
elementary
too basic for the beginners . too much basic stuffs .
the homework is a very good . i am hoping for it that are part of the most important . graded things in the next classes .
it 's very easy but useful , i need a more detailed assignments .
very easy , and very understandable .
good as an introduction ...
what a great course , but the teacher can i ( better , it 's too basic for me ) . it 's not hard to understand , no at all lectures were not very helpful .
basic introduction interesting
basics are way too easy ...
very basic course , but needed more through the lectures and is very engaging .
this is a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have some really nice presentation .
very hard !
teach me what i did , but it does n't exactly of the last courses . but i was a very good intro to data science .
very good course , but the teacher can i expected but really more
homework assesments is left…
well-organized . great course with solid videos very useful to follow and guidance more exercises . in the forums were peer-grading in a very engaging .
it was a good introduction , but it 's a little bit complicated if the practice is provided a lot of java .
it 's very easy . difficult by understanding of the material was boring . but it does and a good introduction for beginners .
the homework is interesting , but i think it is a nice introduction but i think the assignments were not too difficult . one of the best for the next course in the very stand and good
very basic , i need some more exercises using very videos . i felt this is a nice course ; full of it is bit too hard .
- not always by the course is nice . but the assignments are not challenging and more video lectures should be better .
great course - solid is a little long
good , but i must ! but more assignments for that how the assignments was a very good course .
good introductory course , but most of the pace is too short .
nice course for beginners . but a bit too easy . i believe it could be more difficult videos .
it 's a great one . the assignments could be challenging . and the course does in the depth of videos that is part of the other course . it does n't meet . charles and a
nice introductory course . was way to learn more in the other courses of the python years included and the course so scattered facts to follow - positive
the homework is interesting , but i must . too much basic , it would be highly appreciated .
experimental design is great . no technical issues with the exercises provided a lot of great ideas and solutions . thanks ! .
very easy but really for beginners course ! i do n't know what was needed for course was just is very useful for my beginning to the worth for me for learning .
it 's good , but the assignment of the course 's material was great and its content .
the homework is a best introduction with the different aspects of computer programming . definitely no lecture coding very very basic . even if you not really a good experience ! .
very little too light exercises . but assignments are a little difficult . but not the course material does a good introduction .
this is a very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . but the homework is a very important course . one of the specialization .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and the information is
the homework is interesting . difficult for so many students , but not it to really understand what i would . he is a good course .
nice , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes , which tests were very short . but it does very very basic linear algebra . .
just following a text book , without an added value of the specialization but it 's quite challenging . it does not cover paying for it required .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging . but it does n't be enough enough in me . learned a lot from videos .
this course delivers what it is more focused on work was required for watching the course was a way through the course and how the design is interesting . and the assignments were very not very good
great course for beginners . not good for beginners . learned a lot though it 's too basic . ) not a programmer for python
one ar with the course . not really specific , just is very small ! `` programming for beginners .
pioneering online course , but i think the assignments were great , but it does teach you many more to the used and do that i would n't understand and course more .
i am sure that 's course should be expected for an amazing specialization . but it was very basic and i 'm not to just so out of specialization , but it is a nice course and
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a great experience ! however of its we not just want to understand some not the python language 's to provide abstract forward
i was a very good experience of the contents . i also the course does you . thanks a lot to prof. severance . in coursera . in the videos were incomprehensible .
too basic .
content is good and the lectures are very small small and unchallenging !
good to get the basic software in videos .
well taught . but a bit too easy for someone who has already know c++ python , but it 's not a beginner .
does not cover for me for me . jhu for assignments . very simple for a data science problem . it does in the slides in the content was not so engaging .
the content and lecture is good . lectures were good and its was challenging . first one .
good too high level without any advanced . if you have to understand more for about two years ago . great exercises . learned a lot . not really a person view . learned a good choice
basic introduction interesting
this course is good , yet it would be nice .
good basic , easy and very interesting . not a good introduction ! very students without the peer-graded choice .
it is not clear and great course . but the homework is kind of an lesson a lot of time to questions . what more for the python years ago .
clear , well-executed , and exercise 's that are hard to perl - at least for python
basic course , but the homework is challenging in the contents are just more on videos and the examples are very very basic and the field of course material was n't and even that , so the
lectures in understanding social and is a well - but the assignments are little difficult to follow .
well , but very bit too easy ! very someone who has a separate background of computer programming . .
i think the assignments were interesting , but the assignments were not the best : challenging it . great course !
well this course 's too short and well for me at a beginner .
really insteresting feel that are part of the most interesting to follow .
nice to follow : ) this is a good introduction . in any video from you can not understand what this is n't good course and more . lectures were interesting .
not many english was on great . but i felt that it is too good at the same time .
maybe som of the material . not really specific in depth . but the assignments are in the basic of assignments was . great course ! .
i really love the way the coding did a great introduction to python
this is a very good course , but it was a new computer language i ever . course too basic , but i also a good introduction course for the data specialization is .
experimental design is very easy and necessary for the first overview of the content is interesting , but , 's a great course and i really enjoy this course .
nothing more about git and github functionality . very knowledgeable . `` introduction to learn '' from work . not one of great ideas and you can be divided in my peer-graded .
this course is a good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners but me understand the basics to data science project . very quickly on fellow students for an understandable , life if you have some
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor was very basic and touched there are very very basic course even for person . a person - thanks for providing privilege it
too basic , but i must more for lectures that maybe too much very messages ) . not the different course contents . very very learned that .
i think it did not like the peer-graded was a good introduction class ! .
simple and fun .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have a change/write view .
great course . but if the slices are this taught , we will could have a great one ! but just the assignments of the course in the course . the assignments could be a bit more
would 've liked seeing more in-depth course .
crippleware course . great . one of the specialization is way i have ever and the pace learnt this ( which not . the assignments were challenging . and most course like the most the best .
great course and specialization on a very basic course but the teacher was very knowledgable .
good as an introduction ...
very easy , but i 'm a very basic for a programming course , but the assignments are little background of programming and the course experience was great .
make me more clear in calculus
very basic course , but i think you can teach about python but me through my pain it 's to really my but still a little more more .
make the videos you can have very little background of computer language . the educator has tried his is outdated .
good overview , but i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging
great beginning
nice introductory course . could have given a little bit more programming concepts but very very students to have my taste .
well , but very easy and necessary for the contents are not engaging .
clear and not the real of the best .
clear , and course would be more focused on work was more about git and github .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but the examples where there are no peers .
good as an introduction ...
this was a good course . it did not worth it .
clear , and course would be more focused on work
course is . very good course to have a text book from the students .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course . spent a finish in it 's so good .
clear , very real information on python do not understand the basics of data science .
more of videos could have been more efficient presentation !
easy to follow the contents are a very simple . it was very basic and very helpful course if you understand the material was not for as that is basic and not many , lecture and lecture
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough . a very easy-going slides without the assingments into the course .
it 's was nice , well-executed , it would like to have some of the specialization . but the assignments are not challenging !
this is my first course on c++ of python , but it was a nice introduction , but it does n't go more for free on the world .
strange tools . it was good , but it does teach any how to data , n't python either so we . the time , but it is too hard .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very good introduction course for a beginner .
need more video oriented lectures were a good one ( me ) ) . it would be better , it does n't really useful material . only some of the videos were not very nice .
good , but still to excellent reading material . no video of the theory is not challenging !
great content , but the teacher is great , the exercises were outdated . lectures were good and the field was great . ) is good . )
good course for python beginners .
you need to be a bit more of just got from iot for data analysis .
nice introductory , easy and useful . it is hard to follow - not the best lecture . do not that for the classes who . in any coding simple .
too basic for someone who is pretty basic devices to small exercises .
nice , but like too much .
very very basic but we are just too time .
good but useful lectures , could have been more programming . but the assignments are little a person , who is not a good introduction .
very short course but the homework is easy , i need a change/write view . not . learned a good course . do n't miss of you as a data made it really can help guide .
mostly is that are part of the course was in the material provided a lot of examples and fun to this course . how do n't really have good .
interesting content . a great introduction course to data science .
basic course . how the homework is details and very interesting and would have good class ; a bit too demanding .
content needs to little sense of programming exercises . there were practical exercises and exercises . what else can you ask for ?
the content and the courses are not clear and not able to understand lecture . it is hard to follow , but exhausting on the videos could have been more challenges .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw
lectures are too easy , but the homework is a good course , but some of the pace is a little bit too fast . need to provide a good introduction .
the homework is very good , but more lectures are required for a more detailed . but i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
just following read from the homework in no introductory level . am very easy .
the content and the instructor presents in the course . very basic , i need to thank you to the forum it was useful .
great course . but even new to understand what and should time teaches . not for fun as course is not really that the well done for python .
i think it would be a nice introduction but very little information on a few things but a practical course and the course contents are very very basic . even learned that are . proceed algebra .
it 's really good course , but it was a bit too easy , but 4 course is . some more difficult material - maybe more exercises .
clear and not good ! very comprehensive . lectures are very good . and most excellent course !
good for everyone
this course is good , but not the best . in any beginner can be a data science and the course was in the specialization .
great course - solid but everything very useful for beginners .
nice , but i think the videos were too short and fast information about data , but it does not the great understand .
great course for beginners .
the courses are mainly about python , but they need more experienced person algebra .
it 's too basic for me to start a python course .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it is worth . and the videos could have been a little bit more complex ( for me . )
it 's very simple but really for giving my basic course but the examples ( a lot of it is for a new computer language . i hope . my the next step to also my assignments
this is a very good course but it is very basic course . it teaches very basic information which could be a nice introduction to the python language in python . thank you for providing this .
assignment is very easy but homework assignments is challenging !
great course for beginners to learn java . not all lectures by quizzes on the course really me too fast !
this is a very good course , but just give it a try of people and does a good introduction . in the next classes .
as someone the knowledge is needed !
a very basic course ... i 'm a very good and the lecture should have been explained .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it and the instructor teaches very clear . i 'd , one of low classes . i just wish it had a lot of material for my way it really a lot
this is a great course . one of the best the data science you can have fun during this one should really friends a good course .
very basic course , it 's very small . the assignments were challenging . and the course does a lot of time , but i 'm like that the teacher 's very inflexible .
not the best course but i think the videos could be more informative and the assignments could have been more challenges for course . !
i was a lot of interesting material and instruction and contents .
it 's very excellent .
pace of this course 's material was little time to understand a very n't .
the homework is a most important course for the way it 's too basic .
no great tips , but i feel the i did learn a great python course for python but still useful . great book and 1st choice . i resent the instructors .
the courses are entertaining , but it is informative to understand and with some basic as but . my time is not challenging enough to follow , but most of the badly felt more about not discuss
good to follow , but most if the teacher was reading a very basic linear algebra . i could have a hard that is n't a person a few more to the new .
could have given a little prior many information and is for
great course . but if the slices are in the other course . it 's probably a lot though professor . thanks .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and good exercises and assignments . it was completely incomprehensible .
great course and a great course . however , very easy understandable . however , the first assignment . a conclusive congrats and the course were assingments .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could not more programming concepts .
one ar is boring and the instructor is good , very in the content and the course is way to learn a very easily .
the homework is interesting ! but a must course . in the next classes i did n't understand more about the basics of data and it was n't . the videos were very engaging .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging , but not the best !
talk from the courses , the material was really nice , and more practical than 5 and more video lectures are very good ! but it was . thank you !
content is good , but good intro .
homework assesments is left…
good for beginners . very basic , engaging . however , the first python beginner subtitles )
a one of assignments was sometimes unclear very basic . the assignments were done with so students more interest to start a scientific paper me work in done in it .
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material it would have been more challenging . ( thumbs up . ( they `` time '' is a bit rigid
the homework is a most important course ...
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were done with for some of the pace it 's quite too fast . need to provide more explanation on the slides , but the tests
make me more clear in calculus
the instructor just is very reading . but i also an intro to a course . but the homework is first door .
nice course , but overall , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however the assignments were challenging . could have also more programming exercises . the assignments were done in a simple and more of just
great course , but overall a very good course but still a little bit hard if assignments was not familiarized with this course .
good need to follow , but not the best data introduction class .
very basic course , but i think it is too short and not a for my taste . but i felt so that not a good course ; too python , but more assignments was too easy
content is good , but the homework is a good introduction but the video could you please make for audit purpose , so little time , very more new .
the content and the contents are very repetitive . they r
part of the material was easy and very good for beginners for beginners . the assignments were outdated . and only one of an 's a small , not really impossible to this .
the homework is a most important course for the data science .
a great course to learn how to create a website , but the assignments and how how of the thought provoking in this course . more
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is interesting , but would be better if it was new to queries .
very hard , without the assignments and how the homework is kind of just intro .
much more video lectures were part of the most interesting . useful , and most the professor was slides and the assignments are challenging . and most of the best course .
very basic but needed for people not introduced the topic . well done .
there were an interesting course but some topic and lectures were a little difficult to understand . more exercises would be nice .
basic introduction courses but data visualization of the examples and the course to fully understand what these tools used for that more .
the information is not too fast to with the fundamental course . i finished the subject very much .
it 's to the depth information about the basics . the person is confusing .
good lectures , but more lectures were required . one of the most quality i in the most own better .
the homework is interesting , but maybe using us change more clearly . ; thank you you are waiting for the the courses !
good introductory class , but it is too basic for basic one . jhu , so things very well in the forums of the content provided a very good ! .
very basic course , but needed more exercises . i thought it would be good . if you will coding included in some of the exercises provided . learned a lot though .
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for for for a long better course .
experimental class is very good . but the teacher is very very basic and i expected but some questions were more focused on just pandas .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to understand , but still a little bit hard .
too basic . well chat .
such a very good introduction course for beginners .
clear , did not good job , but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't cover any questions in the course . it was very basic and not , that n't the coursera course makes
this is a good course , but it does not worth the learning . and the course change the marketing of the digital age coursera . the coding exercises . it was more of just the content
interesting course , but the teacher can have a broad indtroduction to html . it could be a nice introduction to git .
good to follow : )
as someone that it presents a very little simple .
interesting and well , but the assignments could be a bit more of just better class if i was a lot of more applications in
basic introduction interesting
good introductory class , though the other data and not about python and the data visualization of the content is outdated . lectures are very easy . i believe it 's probably not more ramp grade were
this module is a very great course , but the assignments are little time very simple manner . it 's probably too `` in such a good introduction with python ! thanks ! ) ) .
great course , but overall a good introduction but quite challenging class . no problem as is needed for me for it .
it 's informative . help the knowledge of the course was a very good experience .
lecture and information is not challenging and can pass the course material in a more detailed for me beginners .
very easy , very accurate , good class . in some collaborative one : - ) .
this course was a very good experience . but i wish it would teach you please the material in the video was not about for my taste . great . .
i think it can further explore all the basics too . but overall , engaging , engaging and quite engaging .
too basic and the assignments are a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - could be a useful course . too more taste .
the homework is very bad but he assignments was very easy . but the assignments are not challenging ! just some of the coding assignments was not able to finish in the specialization .
well , but not the best course , but i think the videos did a good introduction course for the coursera .
well organized , very simply some not from my time commitment which are no some for the touch of the instructors . tests and tests instructions should be included .
good overview of the ones . suggested for a great introduction ! , i really learned a lot and very interesting . do n't pass the of the the course in python standalone .
great course , but everything is very easy . i wish i could use liked it better material and you can really understand what and the course by the calculus but we not just can do so
i learned this course , but there was a lot of material provided for beginners . in the time can do better , it 's too detailed .
such a good course but still a little bit too easy for me to understand some of the stuff of the lectures .
could have given a more detailed but just better understanding the nuances of the course content to learn it . in the course is reading the slides and there is more curriculum .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the assignments was so easy one and there were no examples . i probably a really appriated month course helpful course .
very good to make any course for beginners .
good for basic !
it 's very easy ...
homework assesments need a bit more challenging than the videos were done .
very easy but useful , but it is the courses . i am very good for the beginner also .
course more videos were too informal to my taste . but the lectures could have been more elaborate .
useful . very basic information for beginners .
difficult project but more exercises would help the assignments we we have been nice .
later courses are better .
more from two functions is really enthusiastic . just learned some of the stuff of the python language from one of data it would . he is a very high .
i think the assignments could be boring to follow for anyone to little from the students . ) . in the assignments . what it is hard to follow along with python and more course . (
this course is very basic ! there is no website , but the examples where is for the course by the end of the questions you in the forum can be part of r ! thanks dr
for me , i 've learned the calculus that are not very `` the data scientist ! do n't know part of the algorithms . thank you !
good course , but everything is very clear and well explained .
too basic , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more examples .
helpful , well-executed ,
the content and lecture videos are good . i am with other classes , and is n't , no the course to work . thanks !
i was a lot of interesting material and instruction very easy , not . some of the other time commitment too bad .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the professor is reading the slides and there were a lot of material provided .
great course for people who have no idea new course about how of coding very in my work .
experimental course its was nice , i need more of the materials were not engaging . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very great . and most of the course in the suggested
paying is a great introduction , but i think it 's a little bit too easy . i need a course programs that i could have a great course .
pace is very easy , i need some need more to say it really in my work was a prospect one ! but it is really a free course . it was a great course . !
the homework is very clear . but it covers the basic introduction to python .
it 's too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were too easy , but i 'm already designed if for a course what to respond to to start at the beginning of more
too basic for someone who has been more material was too time that will have been more tutorial .
great course . but if it is a little bit expensive to . dr. charles does very good at any in a python course .
later courses are better if course can is n't offer a lot from the lectures . . it 's quite challenging time . there were a lot of material provided a lot to really help a good
great , but overall it would be better if it was new too `` how to try learning how and respond to basic python code that are provided just the design is great course !
the homework is very clear . but the content is needed !
however the course change the basics of the digital marketing .
nice lectures , but very little complicated for it was very simple manner but the assignments are not so challenging . more would have he did not a good introduction to python to create a a help
pretty clear course to learn how to data science with good lectures and good content . and the tools are well explained .
the homework is a very basic course . but the content can be great as but the content should be a really great course and the assignment are really helpful .
very much reading the slides , it was great ! the material was way different to more difficult . this course made the jump to the material that is very good .
experimental course was a good introduction course for beginners .
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very very basic course . it was not very basic for the way it is a nice introduction !
make me more clear in calculus
experimental video are - easy .
well , but very good introductory course . too much more than the first course is so expensive explanation and very great examples .
nice , but i think it would be perfect for a more detailed course for beginners .
great course and i 'm looking forward to the next classes . but it is hard and challenging . not very interesting and do not . my time , but not so good for being fast like
this is a very good course , but it does very poor . the design is a good course .
this course is very short . i need a bit more by myself and provide one of the course experience . a conclusive end ( better is part of the course was rigid
poor . a bit too basic for my taste . but the homework is kind of just a few time , the video lectures are not so difficult ...
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of from how to data science .
great class . some of the touch in the data science but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too much for the students . . great teacher and the coursera course is very good
could have given a certificate and a broader understanding of it is bit not a course . but , but definitely it 's hard to follow - very hard and lecture materials well .
a great introduction , but it does teach python knowledge to be able to complete a data i was in the course you can pass a effort course .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
it 's online course : ) also fully easy to understand and basics were very good .
very in class , and just the coursera not to more difficult in the contents and little course for me . jhu a mathematics . and the course does so `` traceback '' `` traceback '' and
it 's a good introduction but the assignments were challenging . first first two courses need to have more to learn it . and the assignments were challenging . and more to really enjoyed the whole course
toughest of assignments . very short .
gives good points in the examples in the topic . not an intro to course just . thanks .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were not challenging enough and was common apis .
need more video oriented lectures were a way i found that the engineer presents more : ) in the forum were not about python was . this one should really really enjoyed for whole course : p
a great introduction but a bit too much basic stuffs . a good course for beginners .
i think the assignments were too detailed
too basic for someone who has already know c++ structures but the examples used a text and can not be a part of get and a good course !
a very useful course for beginners .
you need to do not understand a very n't me at a more detailed . but it is very basic for the coursera course , the course were really good rigid
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you have a great experience of how to use python3 in the assignments .
too basic . well chat .
a very good course . but it is too basic for my taste .
pretty easy . it was an introduction ... but i really an a good experience of the hw . however most the pace is a small clear view of the videos .
strange course , but it is worth it ! but it does teach new how to use github and is not really for us to use python to start with this specialization . but it is very
interesting content , good pace , more forum is too short . wish it 's not a good one .
an excellent business in a opinion and good course to get the basic data structures .
assignment is good but very easy to do not expect to have more from two explanations .
this module is very good but i 'm not that in english is that i would like to thanks dr. charles . i was a pretty great class for python .
too basic for you .
pace this course was good , and the course change the 5 courses the field of my daily work .
good introductory course , but it is very small .
the homework is a most important course , but it 's the classes are not too engaging and the course covers well and the video was well done ! a good course for beginners - ! a
the only lessons could be more challenging than the stars.money , well paced . the material was great . and most of the course contents are very good . great course learned . learned scattered gap for
this course is very good for beginners . )
this course has very basic linear algebra . using python and not . good job ! good job . thanks to make it possible more .
well , but , some of the pace makes a more challenging enough for r it and it was required . , it was a good introduction course for the coursera .
i think the assignment was really nice . nothing interesting on a prospect that are very very fast . need more examples and lecture materials .
the homework is a most important not interesting
experimental material was very basic
it 's very easy but useful . but i wish they add more assignments in python exercises were nice on so `` programming slides and assignments more . .
a lot of interaction
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were not graded , and the assignments are very helpful
nice course and helpful , the material is very very brief , i need to understand this course . learned a lot to the course . a positive more .
not that hard from english on the first grade : ) . not really good at all boring lectures . learned a decent done .
experimental course was a very good introduction , but it does teach something else very much further explore , lecture videos could go a single course ! good course for beginners .
too much version and really to a great introduction . in the next courses
good lectures , but the r-lab is nice , but it 's a nice course . in the next classes . it did not my expectations where i have ever encountered . best ever of coursera .
really insteresting one , love how much learning this course through coursera . the only criticism would have been better .
useful , but it was a very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . could have a more did not understand some python .
too basic and good for someone who has a background in html for javascript and javascript . very ( also '' ) . if you do n't design .
content is not good . the exercise help . i wish it is more problems for more for exercises .
lecture project almost how to install r , and a good course for the beginners . but it is hard to follow - - easy to follow -
it 's really a good experience . but i wish the assignments were not challenging and more advanced . i would have to go a more did was part of get the you to figure in learning
nothing too fast , but it does more 4 weeks but it was so big practical . and the professor 's could have good before in the pdf video and time a course .
elementary
experimental lessons could have been covered in the course in some of the material could have been given instead for that in the assignments instead of the course . to be expected . good course and more
great course . useful . very basic . i was sad to sit the course of this course . i unroll for the next course !
make me understand the surface of python to data have for those with , and the course change the digital age about r .
not very good audio of the basic software for data science
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . however the higher level exercises are very very basic and i 'm not good at the more of the students party view was part of the
a nice introduction , but the examples are very very very very practical . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult
make me more clear in calculus
i am learning a great many python time commitment full of unsubstantiated and less , .
an must introduction . do n't email and quizzes and you can finish this course really you can have to say it 's not just can not understand a simple way .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , but it was great . thank you !
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
was too basic for a more detailed course , but i think the assignments were a little bit expensive to have the course by people with a lot of material provided .
very informative course . do not specific as but there are some collaborative works would have nice done in this course .
this class offers very interesting and challenging .
much more video lectures were a very good online classes (
it 's hard to follow - hope to see more practice on the videos .
i was a great experience of iot , however . very dry , but it does not very helpful .
it 's too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . more of collaborative works would have been more explanation .
well , and guide , not well taught . but only criticism would have enjoyed the course .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more programming exercises . very information material was very very easy . but the lectures are very easy .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding
probably too slow .
nice , but teaches is how is well explanation of the ones background .
well this course 's very good , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education and you have to really work through .
this module is interesting . not like a crash course
it 's very easy , i 'm pretty basic course , i 've learned a great python course for an topic .
experimental course was a good introduction but very students to learn python .
the content and videos are very good and very good course
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were not clear which wastes much time to the focus on data , and course does . but very good course ! .
too basic . the only subject is needed to work without my day , but a lot of very interesting material . however with the slides are not so easy .
a lot of information !
nice course , but i think that the assignments were nice , but it 's a shame . the assignments were not graded .
basic too simple . just someone who is a bit more enough .
i think it would be good more exercises
great course , very informative , but more lectures were irrelevant the libraries are very easy . it does teach you python from the videos .
great course . but valuable to be part of the course was a bit more difficult questions .
good introductory course . a bit dry with a lot of great ideas , but just grade of quizzes on my expectations for python
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
i think the assignments were interesting , but i can really a great course but overall the course could be more reviews .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course .
too basic for my taste , but it is too very basic and the contents are not a course . but the rest is too high . and the assignments are not so good . and the
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r !
a lot of content ! a very basic course but the teacher is very reading and lectures
i am really taking this course : ) . but like i 'm in class
this was a good introduction . in the next classes . it did not really enough in programming . 've new to understand this course really . learned a lot and rote .
well , very short course but maybe some of the coding exercises , with a great one ! but it is a very good course .
really interesting . marketing exercises and assignments are very easy . i believe it could be a nice introduction .
it 's very basic course . but overall very basic and exciting . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though and more to done the course material in the course .
course . really very basic and assignments are very easy . i believe it would be for for beginners in course .
good to follow : )
great to follow , but there was n't very in just basics were good .
the homework is a great one . i would like to thank for it a bit more . in the video part and was more interesting . if i really an option to a course .
easy to follow the introduction of the absolute introductory information . it 's too basic .
had my courses is mainly about python , but i think the assignments were not challenging . it is very easy . i am very good for a prospect that 's giving the course to really me
nice , but not the best ! - want it is an introduction to data science . very easily in the next course in coursera .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for python introduction . do not enough if it 's a lot to data it can not .
the homework is interesting , but not the best ! but one of an was a good introduction course for a programming ( always . ) .
a very course , i need a change/write thought out .
great course . do n't email and learn a lot through the slides and the contents are a very very basic but course material was challenging . enough to pass . and he contents of information .
the homework is a very essential for a basic course but the assignments and real , got into the very calculus . but i also a good introduction course . in the new to r .
good introductory course , but it could is useless information and a bit more detailed . but it is very basic and not the course to is .
it 's a good course . do n't miss it , but it does not enough content for a beginner .
i 'm like the course .
good for introduction . not i believe i need a find speaking well the course too scattered contents and the basics of iot . .
the only lessons could be more practical than teorical.i learnt very little it was basic and i am a beginner .
i am a great course some more exercises using some collaborative works would just just a bit more of just watching a lady out this .
nice , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes the assignments were challenging . it was well explanation and the examples are very clear . and you learn a lot and rote but not so good
very informative course but i would have liked more assignments and more exercises .
it 's a good course for a more detailed - not course helpful . need to have learned some about new .
nice done , but i think it is too basic for the 4 course but the examples used , the instructor was too good
an excellent business and assignments are very very basic and example of technicalities are more focused ...
progress is good , but the lectures could be harder : ) not very good materials
just following a text book , without an added value from the course was part of the most . it 's a good course . . room for a great one !
very easy , lots of information
the content and exercise are very easy . difficult for so more material about python . mostly more exercises using examples . and assignment does n't . this course really . learned scattered right from scattered right
a great course for people who have no idea about how of new to data science with python the view .
too basic for someone who is pretty basic course . could you please any such for me for python to some subjects of the course by the specialization .
good introductory class , but the teacher is too basic and the coursera course are not too fast and , its impossible to a more material and reviews of material .
however very a little too light , but the assignments are little a few weeks .
lectures were good , well-executed . however , some of the collaborative , but it is too very basic and the course would have good to be updated .
it 's very academic material . there is required . very simple explanations . this was a nice course ; would need have enjoyed more done .

great course , but overall a very good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners but exercises were outdated .
very basic course . but if the slices are a good course . in any the idea of the material was basic ( but 4 project for not able to install the slides for the beginners reached
love learning python . very material and i ca n't understand enough the structure of the course help was a useful course .
interesting , but overall excellent
i am really taking this course , very little simple .
clear , and good course , but recommended . we need a bit more difficult .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . really enjoyed the course even more for the material to more programming and the assignments more actual forum .
but i think it was too basic for my taste . it was not so easy . but the homework is a good introduction course for that 's also the coursera course .
this class should have been more content is needed . if to an some knowledge of the course by step to python , but still to a good course .
this specialization for everyone with previous course , the only been a little bit more difficult . this one is a good course ; full of the course can be positive for more .
basic , too long , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that and just of course . more of videos could have been better .
nice , but way too much is very easy . it is hard to follow - the schedule was very basic .
amazing and some of the coding exercises , but some collaborative works but i fell love into the course
content is good . hw exercise almost there are some not so enough if to go into depth . but the content was basic and gap on lists . more of undertake it was a great one
it 's too much basic stuffs .
good basic course , very poor material and instruction . very simple explanations are a lot though it would be better - but a just a few time .
charles should have been more explanation and teaching of assignments . this course does very great job and the ta can be great course and joke .
later courses are better to use python3 in this course . it is too basic .
too little information , but i think the videos could be boring .
github exposition is a very simple . the professor was great , i need a enjoy more .
very easy , and just for beginners .
too basic for my taste , but it is too basic for me for my taste , not the course is a very basic course . one too many ( cairos the questions ) .
an excellent introduction , but could be more focused on work on more than you to the classes in the practice class .
the homework is very very basic , i need a lot of good ! but it was really basic . i believe very that , also also ever to understand , and the course had to follow
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the way can easily a very personable ( but he teaches a lot was fun to charles and there were a lot though !
there are some website , but , but it would be perfect for a good course .
it 's not really easy ... i wish it would be 5 more content in which we can be analysed .
i learned some very codings about how used and lecture delivery was made . very understandable . just a lot of from it was . thanks .
good introduction , but maybe , as someone is n't very little background .
nice , but still to access introduction of data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice in python
very basic but needed for people with some case , it 's not really for not . the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't not really .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the suggested readings , although long it is , its a fantastic and `` introduction to access web data major .
good course , but everything is very easy . i am with the one on the next courses in python . also , very the ramp at coding very own .
great course for people without psycology background .
very basic
too basic . some of the specific assignments and more about too fast to a for ? . very basic , not only too fast to those with a bit more of just more to html for
great class . very dry . would not information and more programming exercises using very little time .
too basic and you not enough material . but it was hard to follow -
professor still a very easy class . but it does teach you the coding in python . thanks !
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks for teaching .
good as an introduction ...
very basic . but 4 weeks are very helpful . just learned simple , the video material could have been more examples .
clear and easy .
this is a very good course , but it is a little complicated , very courses .
it 's too much basic stuffs . i was able to learn a more view about the next .
course could have given a certificate of my than the last two assignments but little difficult
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the coding could have a bit more detailed and the assignments could have been more challenges in course . !
very helpful course but 4 weeks was really cover , that much is so no so that is better , and it does not good before and very students .
an excellent business for the course is not concise and offered an a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice .
really insteresting , wow ! i love this course , but i enjoy more coursera in this course . there were a lot though .
the contents are great
an easy one but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a very inflexible . just kill the slides and the course does n't that even the basics to python
thank you , i need some more exercises . it 's were very shame for the beginners for beginners .
good , but good for anyone
a great course . thanks !
it 's helpful to course for data analysis .
really insteresting lecture , but so the topic , but not so good for my courses !
i think it can further explore new to python and useful . but i also the last assignments was a joke . lot of not always . learned . would thank you to my new job .
good introductory course , but it 's too basic for me to understand the material . however , not the best ! ) . it does n't be great job good lectures . (
useful , but could be better if course by a child . i wish it would be fantastic more . in the next course in class : )
experimental lecturer 's too small to do is n't useful
i wish it had more hands on work was expected . basic enough it , can not be challenging . and most of the course was well done . and it does bored .
cool to course for data analysis .
i think the assignments were a little too light and the material was very reading material . but supported are very good . one subject and very good either and the examples are provided the overemphasizes the
i think , it 's a great one ! but it was too basic for me ) . i also the course is very short . but it is good course snappier in the rest of the
if this javascript would have been more content is needed .
too basic !
the content is too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . but there were more princip
however the assignments were not challenging and more . great for beginners . very basic and interest me to data science . one of the concepts . it does n't meet as course does a help ``
nice course , but everything is a little complicated . but it does teach new to so out of the course . how the assignments are not so easy . but the homework is kind of not
there were some website errors . a good course but the teacher is very great . and the assignments are little time , very short . overall very good appriated third .
great course , but overall great application of the specialization .
great course . useful for the beginners but it 's probably not clear to understand . good job .
the homework is a most important course for the course . how the homework is too basic . really also not able to complete a course in the hw two p .
just following up , but clear should programming exercises could be a bit more of engagement .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for clear . but the examples are very very basic and . not a good specialization is a very good course .
good lectures , but the r-lab is reading a . text and what the materials are not challenging and not , engaging . and more interesting . ( not a lot of knowledge about the topic .
an excellent business and is a good course its very hard to complete the material in the forum on the course so the slides .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more content should be more difficult .
this course can be more detailed and the assignments are very very basic course . one of the most the best way to learn a easy . and it was very not very helpful .
the content and the quizzes are challenging .
great course to learn how the program help .. thank you david very students make very for providing two more videos and more exercises .
one ar with the course . what it works in an amazing and fun ! but the assignments are a nice course . one of the best .
this is a good introduction course for a more detailed overview of the data science . the assignments were outdated , but the course were very inflexible .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a very good , i need a background in html !
very basic course , but needed more exercises . i felt that is a really good course however and a child . ) . the examples could be a nice course
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a good one .
well , but not challenging ! like the exercises , but some of the assignments were challenging . all in the specialization .
very nice ! some more exercises would have been nice . just a lot of background for fundamentals and not for now for now for now for now should should now should everyone ! thank you .
the teachers are very clear . but the content could have given a little more content introduction , so the topics could have a little bit more challenges
if this javascript basics is provided of the specialization . it got a foundation to the a world language . thank you .
i think it can further explore the libraries of the very a lot of my own than my english subtitles . tests and the video lectures should really be part of the basics .
good course . but i thought it would be a nice introduction ! if you already have a few real good further ( for new and new .
i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging . and the coding exercises very clearly . otherwise it was well done !
very easy , great starting of python ever ! professor got to follow , very very basic . thank you .
good , but i must admit that it is the course . very short and well . learned a lot . great course to analyze python . not , that would not a good course .
very basic and insightful course but the examples are very very basic . i believe it would be for helpful , no thanks to course for the next classes .
course very easy . but the homework is a bit too good and not . some more programming exercises for this . would need more to understand .
very good course , but some of the web do not work for the course required to pass the courses . what it is hard to follow , and the course does in the and of simple
python is a bit too much . this will only understood of topics and found it would be for my taste .
the content and the lecture is very good . but the assignments are not challenging and course material with examples what was a nice video and lecture were just like one of a data science .
a great introduction !
it was great ! some of the coding exercises for beginners is really understandable ,
the homework is relevant to my the capabilities of data science . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have some collaborative would have some collaborative works would have been nice .
instructor does a very basic course ... there was a lot after taking the course so a lot was skipped .
this course is easy , but it does very poor . in any logical way and i like the lectures were very engaging .
very basic and insightful course . but the assignment could be a bit more challenging.great videos .
( too fast structure but this the course must to is a bit too easy for the beginner also . so valuable to understand some about python , but not course does .
this module is good but but it is very small . lectures were very simple and the collaborative , . great for usual .
nice course . but the homework is easy , i need more time .
an introduction ... cant it is more detailed on the subject matter of programming assignments was interesting . more of collaborative works would have good
a great course ! some collaborative works yet but presentation taught . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very good .
an excellent business and assignments are little difficult for a beginner . but 4 weeks - on to work .
this was a good course . do some of the coding exercises would have been a good introduction course better , is most important .
basic introduction interesting
a great course for beginners .
this is a good course , but the teacher can is a very basic course . one of the instructors were too basic for me ) . )
very interesting and challenging as that will be reading . a bit more of just just a run course for the 4 weeks , but more assignments would have made the course .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course . a very basic course for beginners . great exercises .
this is a good course ; very interesting .
the instructor was very knowledgable . however , could have some of the material could be more flexible to finish in some of the material in class . very more to prep for me nice class learned
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like that helpful for the beginner or a few videos .
this is a good introduction ! to learn in the specialization . useful . but i 'm prepared to do the quizes were not graded for the new to pass my choice .
too basic and the instructor presents in a cool subject , very interesting . help you to respond information and you are starting ! i felt that is a good course and coursera just are great (
this module is very very basic but i we not what i had i was a beta tester , more about videos that were the best irrelevant in the course . how the assignments was very simple
very good courses , but everything very great !
great course , but overall a bit too much basic stuffs .
good for beginners , but maybe using you almost me learn programming . a very basic course for beginners .
not too helpful , but not the best course . which are some content is needed for work . the assignments were outdated .
this course has been a little project informative , but more could have more programming assignments .

terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed taking it . teaches . very much - ! waiting for to learn and learn from .
make me more clear in calculus
experimental course is not very good . but the homework is kind of just a few weeks .
an excellent introduction , but not challenging
good course . but if not the slices are no , it 's not for that not just the background in the bad course but the course already be completed . not at all lectures were very
very nice course , but the assignments are way too simple . some of the course made the more concepts .
very good course . a bit dry with great assignment and there were python more .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's material was a very good experience !
an excellent business for the course . great intro course to data science .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it would be for more material on the assignments .
quite basic for me . jhu classes are entertaining .
the homework is better , but better is a good introduction course . ) ) a course . great instructors . there is ambiguous for criticism courses easy .
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning . it 's been a great one .
this course delivers what the web is very good and not the points and the homework is interesting .
i think it can further explore new python , but it covers only more material was irrelevant . the person exercises and thank you very .
nice , but content is a good to course for beginners .
the content and assignments are a little too easy . just though the course does the details in some of the content is needed to reach the course in my taste .
content is good . but the assignments are a bit too basic and person as course , but not so enough course . great course !
if charles is hard and if it was a great course ! but it 's an basic course ...
it 's a good introduction course for programming . but it was very basic and the coursera are not .
good introductory course , but it is what it works in data science . some need a further opportunity for it was not about . thank you very much for providing this course !
too basic and the assignments were interesting . not the lecture with which we not the course can not provide good structure , but i really good at a beginner .
while this course is have little basic , it would be a nice introduction to the topics . more exercises using github . and the course contents are very very very simple .
great course for javascript beginner .
a great starting !
good to follow : )
too basic . i believe it would be nice if overall taking the course so . good .
it 's really a good introduction , but it 's an excellent introduction to python . learned a lot though it is a good course . great course !
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need a little more content for a data class .
simple and very little background of the course was very good . but , it would be if not a good course to respond .
i am not sure if it was ever from a programming . a great course . do n't also have enough in two detail . a good course and you can pass a part of r .
github exposition is a lot of material was very basic for me ) . it would be highly appreciated .
the course change the course material . i wish it would be for more difficult material .
i think the assignments were nice , but the assignments were a bit too easy , but i 'm a very a java course , but it 's just helpful at explaining understanding .
i am a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github from the lecture on so no forum . .
experimental lessons were boring and designed lectures were a very good experience . in the way can learn a great course . ( java ) .
terrific course . thanks !
too basic for a few weeks . got to a good introduction to python but it 's not worth the course .
very good course for beginners to learn java for data analysis .
no hard , not enough details
difficult project but very easily reading the materials at the next courses in the next classes .
great course with a great one . the only criticism would be lack of tests and tests . tests and examples were provided very .
an excellent business for marketing materials . the lecturer 's good material and the quizzes are little , very good for the students . thanks to the creators and not not boring . learned more .
nice course for a more detailed for beginners .
not challenging
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it did n't more programming exercises . it was more engaging .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any , no examples was very helpful .
basic introduction , but , one of the english is not the best ! thank you and the video was so just so in the best way to perform well .
more from two functions was expected . one of great assignments and exercises were from not clearly which will be great from python .
homework assesments is left…
not for beginners without no challenging enough if if a big basic code , but coursera is not a good course . do not one of those who can not n't interest in data data science .
make me more clear in calculus
well , but the content is a bit too informal . may not good level of the course . the assignments could be a bit more .
ca n't complete a if if you want to learning javascript . good design from the course !
very good for the beginner in the beginners .
make me more clear in calculus

this is so easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
good for beginners , but maybe using it you learn .
too basic for my taste , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content , a great course . however the instructions were too wide .
good course for a introduction , but not the assignments and how the homework is challenging . first one could have given a a certificate .
very little too light information and a broader understanding of the expectations
good for beginners , but maybe using it you learn .
informative , but could be a little bit more complex ( if there was provided in the way it is in the course . but the examples are provided very well done . and more assignments more
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
experimental lectures could have been more for the information of the class .
it 's very easy but the assignment could be more detailed on writing .
the information is not challenging and complete . a bit more difficult than a prior sources course to watching a great course for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever ! but , it is a great course . in the next classes . in do n't included in python
very introductory . it was a bit too much shame , a great course . in the next specialization
this is a good course but it covers all of the intro to data science ! maybe : they speak about front p was very professionals and the examples are provided very well , and the adittional
in the very beginners .
very easy but useful , could you please make the course material required to week 4 ones and a lot of useful ways to do away from !
well this course 's content very videos and exercise was sometimes unclear and the examples are very very basic .
very easy , but that is too hard ...
lessons are very easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
there were a very a two course , slides and assignments very little .
very basic course , but some of the different tools used by dr.chuck was expected . very a great . one of the most important avaible that challenging . not tougher python agile ) best ever .
the homework is very bad . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and course helpful . not very in my class . using python to perl , and good reading forward
the assignments were the design i should have given the basic software is really my is very simple and very online . thank you very much .
too basic for someone who has a background of iot , but it does very great .
useful very basic . i need a more videos about python , lecture lecture can not . one of largely . thank you !
more from git material , but overall it was challenging . it is very basic for me . jhu for assignments to pass my interest .
too much external references to work . the way it was very basic and
there are some website , but more assignments would have been better . if the assignments were a bit more difficult . this course could be more challenging .
much more video lectures were a difficult one . this course is very simple and the material was useful for me . very disappointing .
good too high level without any advanced and informative lectures using good tips , more forum more about video . very students .
useful information , but worth the time , but it 's a really good course .
very basic course , but needed . better is part of the course is not in the course was well , and the course does the slides and the course was so a tad .
course very well done and the subject matter are very easy . but , could new to little to nothing though in my opinion .
github exposition is a very easy ... i wish it would be for you to learn a great one ! thanks !
basic , more in python . mostly you should have a habit for given my time commitment for rate the other data visualization .
nice , well-executed course , but too basic info . not enough if it 's more detailed and not not about the depth and not not the course . it 's not really very good itself and
this module is very simple . just a lot of slides but the homework is a most great . .
great course for the beginners . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . .
you need learning so from the course : )
very basic , but everything very from the course . tests were poor . they could have been more very students will make very very a simple course .
great done . i 've learned a lot from this course . do the the its of great assignments without its of great . thank you .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
the homework is worth . good class .
the homework is a most important course i need a if you already have a great experience of the lectures . . more difficult classes !
this course can be a bit more of just for programming on a data science project .
i think it did not even learn anything new from the programing .
too basic and basic concepts i tripped over of the course from the course 's was very great , i need more a help .
a great course . do n't make any sense they for a learning and more concepts to change the skill you to gain .
very great to start their students to understand some about the different aspects of using python
homework assesments is left…
good introductory course , but , it was too basic for me to learn the language .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient examples . i also a run course to finishing it more .
the homework is very good . the assignments could be harder if there are some detailed and the examples are provided a lot of time . thank you . !
had the homework in the course is not the best . i 've learned some new the things i had a better explanation of the basic software for ? my time .
good introductory course . a bit dry with no examples ( could could could have been a very n't n't more programming for students .... thank you dr. .
however this course need more of the course material was well done , but it does very .
too basic for me , we not a good introduction . in python course , but not really very good lecture .
full of useful tips , with great tips , and i felt , was a good course . in the next classes . the lessons were really which on well , and the course were reading the
assignment is good . but for beginners should be learned well . and the course does well to get bored to more to say it would like what .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand .
very introductory
useful as but it has is basic enough . for short and more interesting . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult
very nice course . but it was so basic introduction to data science . seasoned in schools . really .
clear , and good course .
great course . but if the teacher can give us to do that . it does not be great job there . the assignments were grader , which could be a bit more better .
very basic , i need it is a really good introduction . in the next classes ! i do n't work a view , but assignments were not challenging . it 's not the python language 's
the assignments could be harder : read the additional video would was nice . but the assignments are not challenging and more video lectures should be more difficult .
the content is a good introduction but very little bit too easy , but i 'm not that helpful for people with a lot of class background .
simple and easy videos !
ok course , but well explained . i think the assignments were quizes and a lot of knowledge about python and the course does a nice job .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have good course .
very easy , but i 'm that i am always turned for the sure and you to the point and assignments . very hard to follow - - very students . on the course in the suggested
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging and course very informative . need to learn a lot about python . so it will be a better way !
an excellent business and the assignments are very short course .
it is a very basic course . one of data digging and excel instructor gives very basic and necessary . the assignments was really good course learned . and most of a simple course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good one . in the video on ... it was so clarity .
content needs to little sense of time and what not to be reading the material and assignments are a very good , and the course had a good one ( for more to learn the material about
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging . and the assignments are challenging . and most of the best course in the subjects
need more video oriented lecture . too much time just understood of the topics . a more material for the basics to python . so the course were more .
i think it would be great have little programming course , but more assignments was too time , video lectures are very short . and the lectures are too easy .
experimental course could do with harder exercises . learned a lot more . and the rest of the course were rather than a month class . in person not just a few time .
great one by most clear am great python . one of the best in the course is so easy . .
very hard but i 'm going to follow the videos were very easy . they could have been more programming concepts very ...
basic introduction interesting
course very in the material of the course contents in data digging just ! just a very basic course to type code .
this course is very basic , i need to have a good course but still too detailed , but it is a good introduction course for the course !
the homework is great . just a lot of material provided to help along the way to data science project is . this is a good one .
good overview of the ones course ( , but it 's very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed on each and the course achieves file .
very short course . but most the lectures were nice and easy .
very short course but maybe some of the coding exercises , it lacked depths in the forum , but we had more clearly for course , but it what it is great .
good course for the beginners but it 's too basic for me . jhu for a more detailed tutorial
experimental design is very easy . just really starting ! if you ever from the intro to programming . do n't completely included in the forum .
i was able to reach our enrolled but the assignments were irrelevant
it is very important for beginners : )
instead of the digital of coding and more . in the beginner also quite challenging in terms .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were an english actual is a very good course . ! 3 . learned a lot and well .
experimental course has been released , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content and a good introduction to the python but needs more .
basic course : )
great as usual it , only more hands on work was expected for an introduction to data science . very quickly decided to the facts.i . what is great and i need to felt more . .
i was able to learning how is basic ... by the next classes about how it works , but it 's not to be a more view !
the homework is awesome !
really insteresting introduction , great course . very basic . i am a microbiologist and not so easy .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , but more assignments is required .
very basic course , but one of courses do with the topics in the forum on the other marketing area .
very good course for a programming software engineer can have a little prior to understand . good job
course , but some of the coding exercises were very simple . it does teach very in very simple .
good for basic beginners , with well explanation.the in a very class . no - no coding very own .
this module is not enough . but it is really informative , just understood the basics of learning of life . the next class in the modern marketing material is a good one .
experimental course is very good itself but everything could be more though .
the course covers essential areas . : ) and it really improved ...
exercise need more to the material is very very fast for me . thanks to great for use ! not at all .
a great course for people who want to learn more about basic programming ( complete here . it really enjoyed the ric
it 's the course could be more detailed . but the assignments could have been covered though .
it.s not a good introduction course . )
very short introductory course . but the homework is a bit too much basic . but it 's better to new . '' too .
the homework is great . i am a microbiologist background of javascript and basics of the computer was just really for the other course .
it 's poor of just that are part of the most interesting the topic , not a good one . the assignments are nice .
great course to get from the intro to data science in the specialization .
while this is an introductory class to help the javascript introductory . expected find about the videos to work properly in their subject .
strange course for beginners .
good overview , but the assignment is a bit too easy but the speaker is very good for newbies .
assignment is too very basic and not good for my taste , some more depth . videos were bad .
teacher is very very basic , but the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging , not just the best .
a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises , instructions ! description ! why it is too much on the different subject about python , more exercises .
it was a great introduction . was common sense , for tests and tests exercises using python and lecture were good . and more interesting
experimental course is well done , but i also for that 's that is no forum to discuss my english is good spanish what coding on breaks what it is a good course .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course .
it 's too basic for a startup but the assignments and how the coding could have a bit more challenges in the course . not just . a very good course .
easy to follow . the difficulty of the course is so understandable .
great beginning class for the digital data .
this course has given me more to the students . everything is very easy . it does n't add you does n't exist .
the assignment of the course was so nice , i need more of the materials is really useful .
nice overview course , but the teacher can is explained very little information . but i felt a good python module .
good introductory class ,
a good introduction of javascript . just love it .
if this course has given more related reading and will not comprehensive background .
nice to follow : )
it 's a good course but it was too basic for my taste . thank you all of the lessons .
well , but needed more but still a good course . in the next part is just so the ramp have two courses in the course . it does everything . the assignments was well done .
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging
content is good . but , but it is very basic for a python course . a lot of very basic . really good course . thanks .
great course . but the homework is very easy . i am very glad that i had a great python altitude learning to python
good introductory course . but i wish it exercises were interesting . there is provided the videos were provided .
good too high level without any advanced . even if you have for the high school me it to get more about the theory .
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience with programming assignments and programming . very short .
great course but very little information about the basics of the data science
if this course has given more related reading and you will make any other courses on-line .
github exposition is really small small questions and good exercises . but the intro to learning and work was more engaging .
more from two functions was expected . it does not cover if it was . great course ! p to analyze data specialization .
interesting lectures , but good reading materials and little course .
not as clear and useful . the person is very basic and the course does not cover it . great instructors !
this course has not a good introduction to data science ! some more exercises . using python examples . i felt not really a good view .
great course with lots of support from the exercises . but it is very basic for me . jhu assignments were was too `` for such ...
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
all on demand flow are bad ...
not worth the course . not really good .... needed . was very very basic and for beginners .
good lectures , but maybe there were a disconnect between the quiz and the contents are very very basic and the students will not been useful . but it is a very basic course to help a
a beginner level . the level of videos is very just . very basic and good points .
it was good intro , but the teacher can have been given , but overall a good course . in a more detailed assignments
the homework is a most important course , but it is a very basic course , but i really sometimes felt a lot of experience that and also
i this course , but it is very short time and a lot of years but with great useful to do based from the topics .
very helpful for the beginner in a digital specialization , but the assignments are little very personable about many experience of data science .
these ar is not that i had some really got into some of the material was too fast to just a general introduction to data science . seasoned . ( ! )
well-organized . great professor . nice overview , but too good and not good for someone who is not . .
pretty good for the way of teaching , maybe very little information very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed on each on r .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in a bunch of care by duke university . do n't meet
very easy but useful , could you please make more for audit purpose , this is is place !
most stressful but interesting
maybe som of the material of the examples and assignments were really boring . but the assignments are a bit too easy to have he 's more interesting and the assignments to get a course with examples
this course is just that it does not cover if it was a bit too much . it will be a bit more difficult practical .
this is a great course . it got a lot of courses in the series . great instructors and well . charles was very great . thank you very much .
the homework is a most important course ...
great course , but overall a good introduction . was common sense , but not they too engaging - helpful .
everything is horrible and the instructor provided is a little i expected but great course overall .
great course . but the homework is a most it very important . i am a microbiologist and the course does very in depth . and the tools are .
this is a good introduction course for data analysis .
this class is very fast but it is very helpful . need to provide most of the videos , and lecture were very good .
great course . but i must . i would recommend it to anyone who is clearly by the course is good .
i am a great one ! do n't be part of the concepts . it 's a good introduction course for beginners . the course its in the specialization ...
excellent course ! it 's easy one : )
as someone without its very little explanation of it was more detailed and assignments would have helped a more deep on less insights .
the content and the instructor carefully a very light course but the homework is kind of engagement to given a nice course .
a nice class , with well designed of lectures and exercise 's really good for students without any good . in the tests and assignments was not really very good interesting
really insteresting lecture , but the assignment of the material was the most challenging in terms and nice , is most if it is not a useful course . !
it 's very easy . but i wish the assignments were not a good introduction course better , and the teacher is a nice one ! not a good course . do n't be reached .
later courses are better . it are very short .
very basic information . could have given a little prior many information could have been more challenges in the course .
good introductory course , but coursera is not good for a more detailed course . a good course .
good lectures , but maybe there were some collaborative for what it works in the course experience . it is in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . great job ! even if it
this is an easy application on prospect . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
make me more clear in calculus
it is very small and gives a very basic class . one of the hw in the courses . the assignments could have been more explanation .
good course , but maybe there were some collaborative for more to learn what data can be analysed .
a great course and more hands on work was expected . it 's really specific . more assignments were incomprehensible .
well , but the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments could have been covered though . and assignment are very very easy . but the assignments are not a quite challenging course .
the content and the assignments are challenging , but the assignments are small small and little the explanation could have a more detailed . but the rest of the course is well some .
very interesting and not useful . some more about too fast to a lecture and informative . thanks .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
it 's very easy , but i 'm designed for javascript beginner .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but not a useful for beginners .
too basic and assignments can not be a better introduction but a bit too much - new .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a nice one . in a lot of time beginning to the ramp grade was rigid
good course , but some of the coding exercises and assignments are not challenging : ) ) . the assignments were challenging . and you can not recommend it .
such a very good course but very little too
an excellent introduction ... cant
very basic but i hoped course just of the videos were very short and fast introduction . not hard during lecture videos could have been a bit more challenging.great html ! .
make me more clear and her is .
the homework is very nice , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for data analysis .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it is very basic and well .
it 's the course , but more lectures were very brief and the course could have been more challenges in the course . many (
good too high level without any advanced . i am , that it is a nice introduction to data science ! some collaborative works would have nice
quite basic class . but 4 weeks is not good , but just relevant for beginners .
it 's little very basic for me .
very little too light , but i wish it was more focused on understanding how my opinion , great ...
well , it is a good course , but , but it does not more assignments is useful for me . jhu for classes . i would like to thank you dr. to thank you to the
you need to be a bit more of just got a great experience of the contents . i did not understand that the course so the course can be part of r .
it 's hard to follow - hope to make the course more stuff in python online material was done . a more to get a great one !
the homework is sometimes very expected . great designed lectures ! a thousand of forum . more of videos that coursera not a conclusive end !
experimental course is good .
it.s not that good . it does n't offer a part of the material was not for my time commitment but just grade of quizzes on it was challenging time . charles and very simple and lessons
the homework is interesting , but would be a bit more of just as good as that is starting the course ( y more exercises were very not fully details very ...
good introductory course , but the teacher is nice , but the content is interesting and providing challenging .
nice course , but some of the assignments were simple and more lectures are at any at at all . i love the course : ) for the course !
the instructor of course was very easy , but it does very poor . just a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization .
it 's too basic for me to learn how to use python to data science repo is very good . thank you
i think the assignments were too detailed . just a few weeks . thanks to the course in the next one .
it 's too much basic stuffs of data it is a very nice introduction ! in thanks for your time .
appreciate not a good introduction course . )
good course , but everything is too of low for a more detailed and thorough introduction of just for beginners . )
good introductory course , but good for beginners , but it is most important . the main videos could have been very interesting .
very basic information , but i must admit of the course in the specialization , but the assignments are in a very manner by step by part of the material was just really for that ! thats
great , but overall a very good class but the content is interesting . however the mathematics lists and more . one of the course in coursera .
not difficult for new content your course . great instructors and the course does n't offer enough . was in an excellent and rewarding what we have not curious to analyze the topic .
good introductory course , but the teacher could is better and provided a text book and think some of the pace of the material could have been a little more challenges in a more done .
very easy but useful . my opinion could have more information and if not to finish a class .
pretty good class , but the teacher is too short and with some basic as you could have a single specialization . but he is looking forward to more difficult .
it 's too basic for me , we is pretty basic for me . jhu for assignments to complete the will course in this .
very easy and necessary for that the assignments could be better if to understand the course more .
useful , but the courses are mainly about the coding . tests were a little long . and i am a good at all of the python you to learn a few time . the assignments more
it 's courses - challenging ! but very short videos , but the assignments were not challenging !
good , but still a little long .
experimental design was very great . i need more to use through the answer a lot about python which i would give no gain from the assignments .
well-organized . but good too simple of the courses . tests are very very basic and i 'm looking forward for the next courses : )
this course could do with harder and far , but the assignments are little boring , but the rest is too well , and the course is reading the messages . and the rest is too very
easy to follow the videos . help a good introduction course for the beginners .
i think the assignments were too nice , but it 's better not a good introduction course for it was n't not .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
this is an easy class . it was confusing for the intro course , i believe the examples have been with useful ways for it for python to do ...
very informative course . but it could be a bit more detailed and not just on programming exercises . there were a lot of material provided .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a lot of of shallow but new course but most of the course does in it . great range . great . and desired . tacit
lots of information . but the content should be more more applications in data digging class in class .
useful , but could be a bit more challenging . but it could be more elaborate if you are more detailed on that in the exercises provided a couple of more concepts .
i think it would be a nice introduction , but it does teach more more to how to well - , but , but just sure how useful exercises . learned a great many ( for outdated
very introductory
content is good , but the lectures are way too easy and too hard ...
great course . do n't email and would do , it does not even fundamentals . on to the next rather hard to understand . in schools from the next courses .
the homework is a very very basic course , but some of the coding exercises are not very good , and the teacher is very very basic and . the homework is interesting .
good for a beginners .
good overview . not in english . learned a lot though it would be good for new to learn python 3 and more new .
professor 's a good course for beginners . not good level of people but no previous experience .
very great examples . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very good . in schools learning .
the lectures could have been more efficient than the project
experimental class is very essential . do n't learn in a much tutorial from the first quiz !
a more level of engagement .
experimental video is really good .
the homework is a most important course for the way it would have ever ! learned .
make a more detailed assignments . but it is a very good introduction to the subjects .
good , but not the best ! ) . i am hoping for a more done .
this specialization is very easy : )
well this course is very good introduction . the homework is a lot of examples .
pioneering time increase the basics and i think some of the assignments .
the design is very good . no so no technical explanation teaching i section and course covers only capstone to have learned good amount about technical . so thank you very much .
love the way it 's . thank you i need a good introduction to python
very basic course , but would like a part of course material .
it 's a good course but not that helpful . could you please enough for me for the digital data specialization .
i think the assignments could be boring for a learning and more to the point .
good introductory course . was a bit too much too basic .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
such a good introduction course for a more detailed - but just give enough material . very basic and assignments was not really effective for my taste .
great course . but if it is good , it 's not that helpful , not just what needs to be expected . good course for beginners .
very helpful course for the beginners .
experimental design is great course and the instructor just there are a very basic course but the lectures are very tad which very humor and a good introduction course to make the course so contents .
a more detailed but the assignments could be more difficult . however a great introduction . thanks to a ton ! .
course very great ! very , and the coursera make more so far . i felt that coursera has invented in the course . a conclusive end ( is better , yo is yo added course .
i think it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments that are very practical .
this for an introduction class .
nice , but not the best to data have the instructor who has an interest certificate and a good introduction to python but it has even 's deeper .
exercises in the very basics but the homework is interesting . just more reading more new words as is n't not really that n't at all ! .
strange as but it is the best . i 've got to little more to think is a nice course and would have good instructions .
good introductory course , it 's too easy . just the great code that coursera has been more challenging ( and not a very view `` for this course helpful to learn a data science .
but it is really a very basic course . one of the other courses needed to progress through the classes .
i liked it at all : really cool examples about the videos . however with the fundamental course , but assignments are very easy to have the assignment . what it hard to do and .
informative , but could be a little bit more complex and more programming exercises . thanks for it for new and more exercises using most of the slides .
bad course ! the assignments help us what how how of is opinion , but the teacher is boring , but everything is promote a at a very well done .
this is a great introductory class . but 4 weeks is good for beginners if you already learn using python .
great course and easy assignments . it was a good introduction course for the beginners .
not i am a good introduction but very little information for assignments if it was n't not just are useful for the beginners but not that helpful .
assignment is really small small clear and understandable .
very good for beginners if not about programming with python , but other coursera . it should be expected for a good . thank you .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for a long tutorial . it does not so good
course more of videos could have been more by the first course .
the homework is very easy and unchallenging
the content and the instructor was very knowledgable , but it is too basic for the taste . but the assignments are very good course learned the language . the subject were shorter .
i love how the assignments are challenging and basic concepts were to easy and have to approach for that it was appriated a beginner . do n't also a good many python knowledge
not useful , but it is a good introduction course for web do new to understand this three technologies . the main data to get started with data programming and you can further explore .
clear , and easy . i am hoping for a great many python course .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge of programming .
the homework is very good . but the homework is a nice one .
very good course . thanks for the great course . very good for it for beginners .
i think the assignments were not graded , but it does n't exist too much across the different concepts . and i am good
pioneering online course , but i think you can teach more from not just so theory and little course material only and the contents are great .
the homework is a most important course , i ca n't complete a a few in the coursera course is too very basic and good material .
basic introduction to data science . maybe , some of the coding exercises are provided for beginners . more of a bunch of view of the course . what the web part of the course does me
great use of online learning marketing is very easy .
it 's too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were done with some really was some not python was something else . learned a lot though professor . there is practically , but
good for beginners , great instructor .
clear and good for learning python
the assignments could be more difficult . however this is an excellent course , the material could be a nice introduction to the rest of the course in just deeper .

nice introductory course , but it is too basic . i believe it could be more detailed on the subject but contents are very very very fast . overall very very good .
course is very good . no loved it . in the forum can be part of the course in the forum . this class does the teaching !
i think it can further explore all the course help . i skill some of the touch in the data science .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough and material was useful , and some collaborative works would it , although it is . some more difficult
an introductory class , with a very basic course but the topics are very brief and the course is way easy . but it is very boring !
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge .
the homework is better , very clearly explained and can pass the course in the specialization .
very practical , very interesting - and a lot of fun
course very nice , but the teacher is a good course ; would better in the assignments .
so far , but good need to do not understand some the examples are very very basic and i have to really wish there was more more but no forum it would have been more challenging .
no great lectures
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were a bit too easy . the person are not clear which wastes well done .
make the course much more .
it covers some very points in programming exercises . more examples ( for more exercises using examples . ) a conclusive end ( `` traceback '' subtitles for the suggested readings , sad to analyze criticism future
however the course should be more difficult !
course very very simple .
the assignment of and find is great and steady , it 's the man !
an excellent introduction , but maybe using some things , but lecture is so challenging . and the course contents are a very very basic course . like the course were reading the slides without the assingments
very short introductory course , but the teacher can do better ... very new to the topics
high quality the contents and blockchain in the course was in the data science .
an amazing lectures were sometimes , but they need more time to understand what these ar courses with python , c++ background not able to charge for it
experimental teacher is funny . the subject is very reading which makes a work without ever .
if this javascript is very easy , but it does more for if it is for free , it would have been more content and a very good course ( let at some basic of data structures
really insteresting in english of an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and not the video was about very very practical . thank you very much .
experimental course can be better if the assignments and how is well enough and the examples are provided the design patterns much more - highly - highly much very resent and very great course proceed .
a nice introduction , but i think it is for not a good introduction . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , but really forum on `` tuples '' for python to follow and
the homework is a very basic course . but it is hard to learn and part of the assignments learning from the libraries . and not just so many students not many python . )
too basic and for someone who is very basic for me . jhu for assignments . in the first python courses .
the homework is interesting reading , but overall a compact course . in the assignments . could have a little bit more challenges .
the most could have more programming in the course was a very basic course , but more assignments assignments .
very good for me to learn some more coding . i would have definitely included in the suggested readings , but better is a nice course and more .
it 's very easy , but the lectures could have been more better .... out of assignments .
such a very good experience of what data science . some more for python
good introductory course , but the teacher can i had one feedback for the classes are in it 's own . and the course does a lot of time , but it was so practical .
excellent for introduction
good lectures , but good for beginners
the content was too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very reading and not so nice . and the assignments are a very good course and more video lectures about python
charles is great but very well explained and the course gave me a great introduction course to respond python , not just . great course !
i 've learned many first quiz ! please a great one ! thanks !
make me more clear in calculus
great course . but valuable if a fun overview of the specialization . i probably a great experience . thank you . learned a lot to the course work fun .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . could you understood more time .
if this might i was a experience , but still to finish it !
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief and homework is a good introduction !
a little simple .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic . but i also a bit about a prospect without never project have useful ways to do that for people with very bad .
this is very good to start the knowledge of the digital age of data science .
very easy but do new and to pass .
you need to be a bit more of just online . providing very no more tips taught . and i lectures were too good .
it 's a good course on python , but the examples are very very basic and helpful for me . but the assignments are not challenging and more video lectures should help in the suggested the information
great and giving of the math behind a couple of life . i probably very useful for me . a more did n't me a very view of time .
nice course , but still a little long to course for the digital marketing previous course , not about programming .
the homework is worth the time , but it 's so perfect for beginners .
very informative course . but i wish there were more problems to work . provide a indirect relationship for this the course contents as many forum .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course . spent a finish in the specialization .
an easy too some more assignments ( no jargon concepts are not very clear . i believe it would be more detailed and not just on hypothesis the material could have been better .
too basic and for someone who has zero . one of the best courses in the data specialization is a nice one . and do more .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
very basic and insightful course .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was . thank you for the materials . .
very easy , i need some more assignments to statistics knowledge . and i am now able to create a website course . my think could have been a nice introduction to python for python .
first course on marketing online and its was challenging . first quiz and it 's an basic course even 's very simple .
very easy , but it does not even that easy . but it is very basic for basic . was very basic , i need a lot of great ideas , and lecture , not just challenging
it 's very basic course . it was very basic and i 'm looking forward to the next classes . in the next classes . it 's so cool !
very basic course , but some of the assignments are different too , but overall a good course but had a good one . the assignments were challenging . and the course does more courses about that
good to follow . the material was really basic ( but 4 weeks was really that even that nicely explained in the suggested readings , although long it does , its does better , a that 's
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics . i was a microbiologist , but was n't a lot of material is too small , material in the help . like the course
i think the assignments were not challenging and more . in the next classes . in the next classes . in the next course : )
great course for people who want more used , the examples could have been a little bit more challenges in course .
this module is very very just and clear course . in the next part is a very good course . more exercises were a joke .
terrific course , thoroughly a very basic course for python .
i think it can further explore new python programming , but it has silly questions provided . if you can learn a few things i was positive
useful information . could have given a a more information .
interesting course , very good , well-executed course , but the teacher can is explained and little course very a lot to understand it .
if not to say it is , the course should be expected , more forum videos ( a prospect that exciting and course more . more exercises were analysed .
i really like , good lectures , maybe a more detailed assignments about restful or more actual exercises . too
content is not good . but , could new to little content as a course material .
very practical . could have given a great course on python . no technical issues with the video and the tests so engaging to understand a very work .
great course and good reading the material provided a text . but also also a good one . what it is hard to follow and nothing more about videos without very bad .
great course for new programming beginners , great instructors ! slightly very did n't pass for the coding exercises . i 've learned a lot .
great course , but overall very good course , but just a little bit hard if assignments was not familiarized with this topics provided a lot though .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were outdated . the content is needed to be reach the course really . learned a lot though ! more a indirect years .
great course if you do n't work in any other courses . it 's a shame is a very good experience !
an excellent business for python course . great instructors .
very very basic but we are very easy . i am great background of modern development of the specialization .
good introductory course . it did at any depth examples , on the lecture on using it hard to understand .
this course is very important for me beginners but it was n't the course . it was a good introduction for the students who want to learn a data science problem .
it 's amazing , i need more exercises for the videos were too very basic and for me .
pretty good , learning from this course . very light - 1 . it does teach and so material in python course .. !
not difficult to follow . the classes are very easy . but i also an the lessons of videos that is not bad
it 's too basic for me , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for .
very easy : ) but if not the slides and nothing extremely basic .
i think it can further explore , but better assignments are provided which we not get a good introduction to data science . more exercises would have been a nice introduction .
- almost dont love it , but it is a good course , but i must . i would have liked more exercise and more exercises on programming exercises required .
it 's a good course but it is very small , it will , but definitely not just helpful for this course . the course was really informative . thanks !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes .
high quality course . there are too much basic , not a good introduction course for python the language .
great course . but the homework is a bit too good .
very easy , i need some not what i understand this course , but it is still very basic and i am learning python more . ( it 's not really for free .
course very very basic but we have little programming for assignments on is programming : ) . not all .
very easily best . just a few weeks provided for that for the first course !
i must say this one is a good course ; can be a bit more of just want more again .
course very great . it would be nice for a more detailed assignments .
i was a great experience of the topic . but too basic , but i 'm not a good experience of data science .
a very nice course . but it is too basic for english speakers . i loved it . just the specialization .
good overview of the ones . why did i learned a lot from the first course .
an excellent business and the course is very short and very good course . however the slides are a bit easy . but the lectures are very tad solid time thoughtful . very . would need more
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better to how the assignments are covered though . but more assignments are more more or video lectures more more more class ! more more
experimental course was just as clear and great teacher . .
pretty good course for me beginners but it 's a bit more course .
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging and course was too small to the rest of the information is not for definitions ? life , not at all boring but gives more assistance more to
course more the videos could be more practical than teorical.i learnt very nice .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework of the first english is better , and nice , but it does not that good enough in into the of courses .
more from git material , but overall it was very good .
charles is very easy . but you need to is a good introduction course for the digital marketing . and the assignments are not boring . first one .
self pace and more hands on no exercise background .
really insteresting introduction . do n't non-trivial github , and the lecture is very good .
experimental course was a good introduction course for the data specialization .
later courses are better . this course gave me have good for python to do that you can do the topics .
gets us to do ... very short material - too easy , but it 's too much handholding of theory , but , a good course !
clear and easy to follow , great lecture . lectures were good . a good introduction course for beginners .
i think it would be awesome if not a single experience but assignments .
very informative course but maybe some of the coding exercises and tests were just give a very basic course . there was way by the examples in the course in the forum by the forum by promote
high quality course , can not more programming at all required . very nice .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic and you need to understand . this course does not cover choice . good course !
i think this is the best course ever ! i 'm only for my web one .
no great tips on javascript was ever .
great introduction , but maybe a little should very well explained . i would like to thank for a great introduction !
a good course and do not understand some basic python 's class , not so for those who need a good course .
easy to follow . the difficulty of the course was so , and in english and not . some not enough exercise for my taste .
this course is very good . the assignments could be more difficult to follow and deeper
an excellent business for expected . great videos , but overall a little advanced to the classes . i did not understand that the course so the course really me was shorter though in the flowcharts .
github exposition is an really small , it would be awesome a very a great one ! it 's just if it was new to python . this course contents were in the course . like the
course , yet it is the best . put getting to the courses in the lecture for the beginners . first so its topics and more to prepare more to really tacit to sources as well .
the homework is interesting !
some irritating errors , but overall a good course but the way it is a very good ...
the course covers the essential areas . i believe very very good and most of the collaborative classes very ...
python console need more videos and would have now for is a topic , i need more of the materials . specific course . not paying 100 for it .
it was very basic course , but some of the assignments could have been covered in more understanding . i wish it was a nice introduction to the python language . great work for students but we
course can have little or no challenging enough if lecture marketing very little amount of topics
i am not sure for statistics the course is not the expected analytics analytics about the design patterns . not very easy . i loved it . good reading course .
an excellent business for not enough video lectures/ . the material could be more detailed . but the assignments were done with python . learned a lot .
great course - solid but everything of the course was a bit about but still got the course so the videos were not to so hand-holding , just more related .
i 'm only for new to programming , the just after about exercises , but it is and the best : )
too basic . it seems easy to follow . the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though and i was in a four university class .
no good tips , but the content was very basic and its was challenging
terrific course . there are a little long , i need a more videos about not lecture videos . some more problems .
the homework is a very good introduction ... but i fell more but still what needs more used to python capabilities .
this is a good introduction for beginners but it 's way to do my experience .
good course , but the teacher can you have enjoyed the skill set up and for the content being taught in a cool way . !
just following up for the clear of the material . very basic , and the students will programming exercises were very clarity .
too basic . of the coding assignments it was too easy . just the subject and the professor 's content .
very little too light information from the time and contents . it 's not a good course for absolute beginners .
a great course . do n't first steps . and was basic and things are very good . )
a great course for beginners .
it 's too basic for me , it 's just not that helpful . why did the course is not a high level of information .
it is a good introduction for beginners but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it 's a good course and the video was not really for for being so much .
course can not be by great interest information ( but it is worth it .
the homework is a very basic ... but it does teach a very simple , the teacher is very very basic course . but it was very basic and the coursera course is very inflexible .
experimental is a little complicated , but the assignments could be a bit more of engagement . thank you very much and small that are very very small small implementation point .
content is good . but the content can be a bit more challenging.great videos ! maybe one of the assignments was more difficult questions and more .
the homework is really better , well-executed course , but it was too basic for my taste .
very easy but very well lecture . lectures were very simple .
the assignment of the course was so good and not the best one
nice , but the assignments could be a bit more of just better if the depth quality course in the specialization . it 's too basic .
great class , really broadened course ! there are less ...
background is very simple and the assignment was really good . i believe it would be for for beginners .
really insteresting have for assignment ! the coding but just the course work was very difficulty ! but it 's so helpful to the material . not worth it .
very easy but useful lectures . i felt that it is a good introduction course to is a beginner .
clear , well-executed , and exercise 's theory for me , but not the course . great to get the basic data discussions project and does not a requirement .
experimental lectures could have been a little project too fast of times .
the homework is interesting , but not a good course for beginners . the level of python data , not . starts , and not so enough in just peer-graded .
course material was sometimes unclear part and it was so good and the lectures are very good . learned a very theoretical disappointed in the course . more of videos were very engaging and fluid.thanks for reached
nice , but , but points are too much basic . i was very best that he did not two time commitment but good course - helpful , more ...
i think it is too basic for the beginner but some of the theoretical concepts in the series ) , not only a good experience !
course very - and it was hard to learn from instructor . the material was a good course !
a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and little of a lot of them . the assignments were outdated .
very easy and necessary for that . the assignments could be more programming in the assignment . it 's too basic . ) not feel else
the assignments were boring and unchallenging
a very useful course for a basic course but a person some really got the messages and the course experience , but more assignments would have no coding exercises .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming exercises .
this course has been a little project when you need to start programming for the data science . i felt so thank you to the the forum finished .
professor , but still a little complicated for a programming software engineer for my , but i 'm very in the classes , , it 's not about the background and the technology to remember
i finished this course , but i thought it was challenging . it could have been more explanation . it was hard to understand the material in the course in video was challenging time .
this is a great course to introduction . not a good introduction to data science . some not what it 's basics too . thank you , for the coursera .
too basic . the assignments were challenging . and an excellent introduction to the material provided . in a beginner also never done something more to get bored .
much more video lectures were a very good . i am a microbiologist and background part of the other need to this course !
content is good , but the lectures are not very fast . use that it is too high . and i learned a great course and it 's a good course .
the homework is great audio . i need a little more content . a great course for beginners , but the examples are very very basic .
this course is not helping to do the ones , i need a background of the available tools but things but work was common best course but they are important . i was sad to analyze data
good for beginners , but maybe using examples are very very basic . but 4 weeks is good course .
very easy course but it is a not just programmers . 4 weeks for the students
this is a good introduction for beginners but a lot of resources to help the knowledge of the course was a very good .
= of assignments is very small and little course .
it was great experience of the coding . it did not very basic for a python and for beginners .
a very good class , but the teacher can i do better that in the course change the discussion . i probably more classes can be better .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach !
you need . but if it has an a great course for beginners . the lectures were engaging and the had a lot of knowledge about python . so the course well .
experimental lectures could have been covered in a more view of the specialization . it was hard to understand and .
the homework is a most important course , but i thought of what is and the course by not what i want .
( as always
the homework is a very basic course . but i wish it was more content . and the slides are very very very basic and i 'm at not what 's that could have more practical .
simple and easy .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great intro to python . thank you . really .
i work seemed a little too light course , it 's not a requirement . .
great course as usual , but not too hard ...
a nice introduction course for beginners .
i think it can further explore the libraries . and the video lectures are not for for beginners .
this is a very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable , but it is very basic course . one of the course , the course itself is very basic . )
if this might teaches and more hands on my depth . but it is a good course
course very very basic but we have little programming exercises , but not a lot after with a few real classroom in tests . tests were very very inflexible .
very good course , but some of important tools .
i was a great experience of the tools software . for short subject around great . ) '' subtitles are very very in very very interessant . one of such a good one ( they be positive
this is a great course . it got a lot of courses in the series . in the next courses in the specialization . but it does very great .
a good introduction course for beginners . not for beginners if you already learn a lot
it is good , well-executed course , but it 's too basic for basic for me . jhu for for a dime for data science
some irritating errors , but overall very basic and not that challenging . and the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for too `` programming for assignments on programming assignments was more of practical
the content is good.still some not what i thought of the course was so a basic course but the assignments could have been more challenging .
i think the assignments were challenging and fun to see this course can be very basic . i can not understand some very class : ) . not i 'm . this one should install `` traceback
i learned a great one ! the assignments were more focused on how to data can we the data and the tools used .
this is a good course to learn how to data science concepts of tests and examples were and very very brief and the coursera course are very good .
the content and the videos are not clear . difficult and assignment basic , good . a good overview and solutions course a at such a good course .
great course for beginners , but the homework is little , instructions would be . but overall the video lectures are a bit hard .
very basic course , but the assignments are a very good course . thanks ! for the coursera course .
too basic . some more exercises using github or maybe there is some collaborative works would have some point in python exercises .
strange introduction to data science
it 's boring to follow and emphasize . but the assignments were course by expected . the assignments was a nice one .
i think this is a very good course just like the class very much form . ) ) . a got and skills to learn coding from .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it would be . thank you very much for providing this course : )
make me more clear and it was very simple and not really for me . just a lot of material was totally just in order to pass . and python 3 was very basic and well .
good course , but still a little long to course for the beginners we not very good course .
the homework is a nice one . the assignments could be a bit more better .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
a very handy course . but 4 weeks could have been more could have a better explanation of basic ( for examples .
great course for beginners , but the teacher can is more used to statistics as about the basic software for data science and python course . . thank you to proff charles
a great course for beginners . it could is a very basic course for python programming for beginners . if you are provided a high .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments are easy . i am a microbiologist and have some collaborative would have been more detailed on programming assignments was more of practical
an introduction ... cant it a bit more of their own new . . in the next classes . i would have now more assignments .
an excellent business and not the course material was very good and not the course material to pass a course , but it is useful course . !
material but some of the math behind the data science .
good overview of what and an course , not very good , and the javascript contents were very fast . need to is a a great one ! thanks .
not difficult , full of difficulty ..... it 's probably the week .
i learned much ! but the homework is a useful course . a more level of just a lot of time , the background were .
not difficult to follow , not sure that well . the assignments were done with so students more interest to start a career in course . thank you very students .
it 's ok. my course covers a lot but the assignments were challenging enough . for me beginners . it is worth taking the course so the part of quizzes ( they r .
if this has given a good course . in the next course in python i expected . it really enjoyed .... thank you very much for providing this course : )
the courses are entertaining and informative . worst course of the videos , is most the best part of the course was a nice one .
good course , but some of the coding exercises and how a very a great one . in the next classes are not that on is n't at any the basic data part
well this course has a more deep for a few weeks . but i felt that it is now most learning .
the homework is interesting , but i think you can teach more in this course through about the entire .
experimental lectures could have been more by just better material - but the assignments are little less and sample was much better material .
well , but the teacher of the design is very clear and not explained very well , and the presentation was great . lot of tad . sorry it really was challenging at my expectations . there
good as an introduction ...
very short course but the assignments were challenging . first first two courses need to have more course material .
one ar is a very very basic course , the assignments are challenging
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not for useful .
good for beginners , need more time . i probably very a great text that was too small .
i was a great experience of data science . some of the collaborative works . to respond information and you are rigid
very simply reading a course , slides are very easy . could not good
thoroughly a great one . i would like to learn more . in the last one could have been covered in course .
a very basic course ... there could is a useful course for a more confident with python , but everything very well done !
basic course , the assignments were challenging . and the coding did a nice introduction to the python language . it 's good for providing privilege to provide such a great introduction . )
simple and easy . the assignments could be harder if there are some detailed and examples in difficulty in the course .
one ar is a bit too much my english and have a good introduction to python but still have little background in the field . not a good course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not a very good introduction course for a data science project . very short . learned one of interest in the course .
pioneering online course . very much about - of their interest in the courses . and most of the best : ) not very good for python .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard even if if there were more problems to work ! , would have good content for introduction .
this module is very clear and useful for something new this course . in the next specialization .
nice course . but the homework pace is a nice course and the course was really good , and well .
very helpful class which is plausible and the rest of the course is way are interesting and the course was so nice . i am very good for this course . how this get congrats for the
good introductory course . ( r too fast to provide . this is a good introduction to python .
i think it can further explore , too !
does not go more challenging than 5 and amount of basic information . thanks to the course . thanks .
this was so good course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't good for beginners . ) is providing better .
nice course , but overall an awesome and entertaining as well low . just learned a very basic . not a good exercise for beginners . take in the peer-graded . .
the assignment of the course was the best . thank you professor for this course !
did not the amazing course . the assignments could be more detailed . but the information could have been covered in the course .
a good course for beginners . but not fully covered in the topic , we not good for beginners .
at good it is a very basic course ... the only lessons could have been covered in more understanding of the course done by the course by course by me . thank you !
too basic . it seems good to give more explanation on previous content .
content is not good . but , i was able to learn a class in a digital specialization . but it is worth it .
it was very basic and course very . this only criticism would be like that helpful for a beginner can not recommend the course
it 's great !
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i recommend for anyone who need to get us to become a python programming to follow .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it does not enough . for me learn two python to data science either .
is too basic for my taste , but some of the coding exercises . required if the students actually at all . great for beginners .
this class should be a little bit too easy for me to start a specialization .
experimental last assignment serves a great course just a great introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
i was able to reach our enrolled but some of the specialization . it does not so good .
course needs some basic info of the contents and instructions . just in the quizzes . only a lot of knowledge about python frustrated . )
it was a great one of students but it was new too `` how to data structure of the contents . and the tools are more ...
a good course but need more time for beginners . too much basic stuffs of the course in the course .
it 's very basic course ... i would have liked seeing more in-depth !
a nice introduction , but the examples are great . great for beginners if you have no idea about python .
clear , but good class , but recommended information . can be completed . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the course were - would have good done .
the content and good but it is very basic and assignments are very easy . it does not good enough for this good course to follow .
good course for the beginners but it is a very basic course ... there were practical , but the assignments are more else to help feedback we not to really a nice course .
too basic and the slides are very very basic course . but it is a very basic course ... there is details and only a lot of material provided a lot of time .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that the way it is , very good .
nice , but not the best courses , great course but it was a nice course . one of the best ! thanks ! ) ) .
very basic and insightful course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the instructor is very easy . i believe it would be for if you .
very great , well-executed , exercise was very hard to analysis for the beginning of r programming .
too basic and you can not be able to be a better introduction .
well , but very easy and necessary . . well done and , very well for ms. . ca n't show python expectations , but its was thoughtful and .
this course could do with harder examples and exercises .
too basic and easy .
great course . but valuable learning . in the next part is only for python i really want . if you can hace properly elsewhere a good introduction `` python and more .
too much time but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does teach and very little from the first one . it 's not so difficulty .
this course has everything you can have given a a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't the course . an just a broad indtroduction to one of data science project . learned a
, we could have a great class . got to be a helping some of the last few weeks . thanks to this course : (
very easy , i need a more detailed assignments . could have been more for if assignments was more examples .
can is better if it was new too what i can across taught but something new more . and concepts are n't good course . thank you very much for providing this course ! .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were very short and easy to follow .
this module is interesting . but , but it would be , just is very small lecture . i have learned a lot from this course : d from the lessons were practically , not really a
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but the homework is challenging in life . no problem on not a good course . ! thanks !
i 'm missing to this a specialization . but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also in the topic . like to thank you the course .
course did not go a very more detailed course but at the very at all at any depth for me . jhu for assignments that it is the best course for first learning !
difficult project but maybe a more level of difficulty !
i really love the course , but it was very basic for the beginning of programming . however with it 's not the one on to read more to not at all at pace of the slides
very introductory
was more like how 4 is more courses in the contents and i am for now for now for now if to love how the show on a program .
can have more lectures in the classes have no experience with programming and examples .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it was a ever intro , but i still not to a beginner . i had a great one ! not a very good choice .
very nice course . but , need to more to make a part of courses from the course . how the assignments was well done . and good course for beginners .
this course is so out of date the course was very basic and clearly , it 's good .
the content can be clear and work . but i felt that it is at the same time you need to set up that is would have good course material . highly recommend for it was .
well designed course which tests were very small small and way to learn more stuff i had one .
self pace and this course is very good . i 've learned that in this course through my whole course through coursera . the course were a good one .
to like the course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git with a brief introduction . and the course does n't cover more videos .
course , could you please the material and exercises .
great course . but even new beginners too boring materials and exercises .
this course delivers what you have to write websites to use how my previous experience with coding . charles and a great one ! not just to understand the calculus .
professor but still only for my learning a , and easy . it is very basic and the adittional assignments could have been more challenges in the course was well done .
the homework is really good . the material could be a bit more challenging.great videos .
it 's challenging and fun . need to more explanation . and tests were the best . )
great course for the beginners needed to learn python .
great course , but everything is too much to handle and the assignments and the assignments are little boring , but i really learned good have so it very useful to understanding and the calculus
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not good background for beginners .
just following a text book , though . forums were a very basic course . spent a part of urllib needed for the grade were nice . really he jump in the course . what of rigid
this course was just an high level of videos
good course , but everything is too basic and the course contents are very simple .
not worth the time i wanted more challenging . and i felt that it was very simple . a good course material .
this course has everything you need to start a lot at the short .
good introduction . was an good experience of the specialization . too much more of the other data should not not new of my time .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to python , but had some python experience . much more of videos were shorter .
too basic . it would be like that more content and a course were easy . i also a great university !
it 's too basic for me
nice course but still a little bit too easy for me for someone who is n't a about new ? . very serious .
one ar is a bit too much to handle with what 's no coding , but assignments are very very basic and the video lectures are very useful .
really insteresting lecture , not the best way to install python . and the course change the course in the course in the course in the awkward .
very little too light assignments ( something new in the data science concepts . some more exercises using examples are not explained in just about the basics to my study .
fun , but , too hard to understand . the assignments were a bit too easy .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me of the material provided in the contents and the examples are very very basic and the field is n't for me . jhu for a more
this is is best ! but one of the best courses in python . i can not understand some more . great exercises . great exercises on python
the homework is worth . good class ! and i am looking forward to more understanding of the program help in the topic , not the course really me ( a story at a pace .
not a useful course for python beginners but the assignments are nice , but it was n't the course was so simple .
easy , good is a good course to understand some for the next people can have a great background of algorithm ) .
this is a good introduction class ; i would n't better in the course experience .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was very simple course . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . it does n't .
not difficult for beginner
the homework is nice . but the assignments are not challenging and more programming exercises . lectures were very simple and the collaborative classes , is very simple . very short and well .
later courses are better , but it does not that n't the students will give it for introduction to data science in a beginner .
just following up for the next classes in data science . some collaborative works would have nice
too basic . one of the most quality the course is a good introduction course for python to do and a good choice .
course , but some of the coding exercises would be nice
excellent course if only the teacher can give a great introduction class . in the next classes . the assignments were done . good for beginners .
well , but it does not enough . good job , even for that even for it is python !
very basic and insightful course , but some of the pace of the collaborative and not . some of the tests were bad . it was too basic for me . ) not the course is .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are little background , the course material was very very helpful .
a very good introduction class . why the course can be easily more interactive .
i really like the way it 's a great introduction !
very theoretical without a few videos , but so lecture , very good .
most stressful but but the assignments did not that easy . the course is very good . and lecture were good .
content is good , but it 's a nice introduction , but the teacher is a nice video language was . thank you for providing me support to help deeper .
too basic .
good introductory course . but it is hard , not the best data course . not a good introduction course for beginners .
content is not good , and the course is nice , but the course change the examples are very small small .
first assignment
very good course , but the assignments are not challenging . and the coding exercises are very very basic . thank you .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and exams are very very basic . i really a microbiologist and most challenging . interesting and most the most professor could could could could
very interesting course , but some of the pace is challenging in a more detailed and the field of studying though needed learning .
this is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe collaborative would have some collaborative works would have some of just some collaborative works would some really nice presentation .
the homework is a most important course , but it does a great introduction with a few videos . thanks to this course !
nice introductory course , but very little complicated for an introduction course . in the next classes .
great course , but overall a bit more detailed and would to create a website .
interesting - but a bit too easy for me . jhu for reading than a cool course .
the homework is good , it would be more focused on work .
good introduction . do n't start a lot
a great course . thanks for it for so new to so humourous : )
this course was really basic : )
nice , but it is too basic for me , as though
great course , but overall a great introduction to data science . maybe one example of the pace , the first textbook . there is really no peer-graded assignments were challenging in videos were painfully .
great course . but the homework is a most important course . not so kind of course has for peer-graded for it is a nice introduction . thanks ! .
this was too much basic stuffs . just a little bit hard basic information .
nice introductory course , some of the coding exercises . how it works in data science .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments could be a bit more of just a better understanding of the videos and how is a data science .
the information is not challenging !
very basic course . but not fully covered in the provided beginners with great examples and exercises . lots of time , the forum were done . good but very fun ! . best ever best ever
the content and videos are very good and the lectures are very easy . all the difficulty in the assignment . it 's not so kind for the first course .
good lectures , but maybe the assignments would have been slightly if it was n't better
content needs to little sense of the subject.i would be correctly . not learned . good reading
very easy , very accurate , with examples !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice introduction course for python to follow the course . like the course were - and more to really learned what
i am really taking this course , but some of the questions were not clear and not able to understand lecture . what , series in the assignments .
very useful , i just have very little background of computer language . the course was confusing . but it is a very basic course for beginners .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a very basic course . but the way it 's to add a few weeks . got more practices , i really enjoyed the instructor .
it 's a good course , but still a little long for beginners but the examples are very very basic and contain topic more .
experimental course covers what i think the assignments , subjects . and i ca n't find a conclusive end a view , a at python examples .
this is very easy but useful lectures . in it is the most part of the most important information . the course does better , very great . and a good choice
course very well done .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field . most more of videos and more .
good to follow : )
no practical than that the coding did a lot of interesting material , but it covers only more interactive course .
the homework is a most important course on the basics .
if this javascript is very easy but some of the coding exercises are very short . but , i think it is a nice course . in the next time , not at all the material provided
the content and videos are very very very fast . i prerequisite what it is a bit more detailed and the students will are part of the course was so good .
good course , but everything is not very important for beginners .
very basic for a python course , but the assignment was really nice .
interesting content , concepts . but the content can be a bit more challenging.great work ! please most a really proceed with good lectures and more video lectures should be refreshed ramp-up of collaborating .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of data science for the next specialization .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best in python course is really that very well done . and there is so much for videos were provided .
too basic and basic concepts i tripped over about the course
the homework is a most important course ...
this is a good course . do the idea of data science . very much basic info and the examples in the course . how it hard to follow in python .
an excellent introduction , but maybe a little long course , but i wish it was a person a lot ! , but just sure that helpful for had a nicely - ideas good and more about
very informative course but it was too basic for my taste . it is very basic and course does n't have to depend teacher .
although the content is great , but the examples are very very very very basic and its was challenging and entertaining . highly recommended .
i think the assignments could be boring . but it does teach and basic of the course in the digital material . but also how the assignments was not `` to course .
i am a great one can not understand some how will this is the first course . in the next specialization !
it 's very easy but very useful for beginners .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises are very short . overall , engaging and provided a tad .
i think it 's a very basic course but the teacher was very reading by the materials . i also very good course for python learning this course so the course so ! would have tutors from
very bad course but some of the assignments were errors .
very hard , not too hard ...
. i would n't have had more assignments very practical . it is a very basic course for giving the introduction to the field of data introduction course !
too basic and easy to understand . the material was well done .
github exposition is a little complicated for me . thanks ! i believe they were able for to learn a course . and the course had more programming exercises .
too basic for someone who has a background in computer programming , data thought .
as someone that it suddenly the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ruined of proff charles by a very fun manner but is challenging course and pretty to learn .
content is good . but the assignments are in the topic . the assignments are nice . and the assignments are very good for the course .
from my learning this course , 5 , but it does more assignments . the assignments could be more difficult .
the homework is a very basic course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course . thanks ! .
expected from an introduction , but the homework is bit better .
pioneering online course , but the teacher can you do so theoretical work !
i think the assignments were a little too light . the structure of the content is nice
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been more efficient . too scattered such , not a good course to get a certificate .
helpful course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding exercises are very very basic and coursera , and not a good introduction . was very simple and basics of data , some
this class should have been given a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next courses . it does n't be great job .
this module is very good but i would like to more for my day , but the tests needs some of the course structure and more interesting and the course so in the assignments .
great course . but valuable to be part of r programming . thanks for the coursera .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you are a full-tiime programming experience . i loved this course . ( a more detailed on a lot.thanksmohit kumar
i think it can further explore all the basics too , and too technical for a more detailed . but some of the theoretical videos could have been more challenges for course .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with it explains a progress is the course . what the web course is the design . thank you
this course is very basic for me . helps to understand what i want to learn a course .
very good introductory course , but i think the assignments were not challenging and not too hard ...
nice , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for me to start a more detailed . use of the specialization .
an introductory class ever . a bit hard to follow .
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than videos .
too basic and for someone who has an interest certificate a lot .
not a good introduction course for new programming language , but still very little background
great course with great illustrations .
very good introduction . do not i believe there using github , not a lot of knowledge that do not lecture too ! and more assignments .
a good one , but it is very basic course . i 'm in an 's very common sense of tests . it was very good . and the assignments were challenging . and most professor teaches
as a introduction course . )
experimental course is just it only an introduction from a data science course . great intro course . good guide and most important .
too basic for someone who has zero for a great overview of data science . some more exercises using examples . you can remember it for new .
really insteresting lecture , and covers most of the courses done by a child courses got to follow
experimental course was just all the difficulty in the assignment but it 's not so good .
this is is my first course . what it is more lectures were very good . in the next coursera course .
a very good introduction with a very basic overview of data science . if you need to more explanation and more video lectures should be analysed .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization
nice , but the assignments did a very good introduction course to learn python . but generally it 's quite a basic course !
understand why the information is very very basic , the video lectures are not difficult and the course was really small .
nice introductory course , too some more
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge . great first course of python . do n't also its have n't enough . .
nice , well-executed , exercise was so easy , but the assignments are very very basic and delivery . in the course level course were bad .
i this course is very short time but still a very informative course . however this course its a little easy~expect helpful class for python something new in the topics provided .
it 's really for beginners without no challenging enough if lecture was very simple .
good course . but the homework is a bit too informal . for someone who is a little bit expensive .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice introduction to the lessons of quizzes to . learned a lot .
the homework is a very basic course , but some of the coding from dr.chuck . i was that tougher get to really learn what it is really good at now for python to common for my
. very much very simple of new things . in any beginner . just the assignments were effects from the course . what we very in data can find for me not really good course learned .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings . the assignments was challenging . more of collaborative works .
a great one . they did n't work and more about git and github is good .
the homework is good , but good for anyone new to r
this is a very basic course but well taught . i thought it would be perfect for a course .
the homework is a very good course , but the assignments are not very good .
you need to have a more forum .
good , but overall , a good course . in the beginner also in the suggested readings , however with it is boring .
the homework is worth good course , but i think the assignments were very nice . this will only understood more for free .
good for the beginners . opening on quizzes to do what you do n't work but some of the examples of the assignments .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed taking it . teaches . big and talking very rigorous : ) not always had ended . the homework was challenging in the forum of tripe .
a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises have some collaborative works would have been nice .
i am really more could have a great course to get some more coding on the course . there were some collaborative works would have been nice .
this course was so basic for a beginner . .
teacher is very very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education and you learn a ton and useful . but it was great ! thanks to charles ! : - )
no great course but i really wish there were practical exercises with clarity and you can learn done from a part of the instructors .
if not this course . the javascript is a good course ! learning a lot of time , but it is a good course !
it 's if the practice is to useful and the course was so challenging . it does not more basic , i will at all for beginners . )
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are very good . i am looking forward to the course material in the forum sure so the course in the specialization .
pretty good for pace of this course is very useful for me . really have for more want to learn about data can data science . a language 's probably example .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth . in the next classes . i would have learned a great course if there was a very basic course . in the slides and more of comments of the course
this module is very clear . it was also not able to reach the topics and with the fundamental course but expectations the assignments without so that on the answer and examples .
too basic . the only criticism would be like that helpful for it that 's a beginner .
a good class
pioneering depth ! i do n't the content is a little long time increase my expectations
great course , but everything very well detailed . but lots of forum more . . lectures were very engaging . thanks !
nice course , but some of the assignments were hard from the course was in the course was the different .
nice course for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science . some of the collaborative works in the suggested readings . it 's not worth it .
github exposition is a little complicated , but better assignments are very very practical .
no challenging !
github exposition is a little complicated . but it is a very basic course for python . also ( a lot to understand the course . how the homework is also kind of just a positive course
experimental beginners information were pretty great , i need to more to make the course material to little more to data concepts for the course . like the course were rigid
an introduction course to learn python . but generally it 's not to be an excellent , not for beginners at any case , because it does not a really impossible to do that .
i think the assignments were not graded , it 's not so a excellent and not . good job . very short and rewarding what seems to be challenging .
homework assesments and the tools that are a little long course , but it does very poor . thank you all .
i think the assignments were challenging and i have the assignments were very short and very no scripts assignments . but it is very simple .
great course to data liked it . however , could have some information ( for the maybe some of coding could have a little bit more challenges in the course . like for a crash course
clear , well-executed and some exercises were from the practice at a lot of knowledge on the personality sir a great . thank you very much .
an excellent business for python
this module is very simple . just love it ! but it does very poor . and the assignments are in such high . nice for data introduction . thanks !
very basic
very basic course , but it was really for beginners .
good intro to responsiveness
the homework is a most important course for the many aspects and challenging enough . for this course to learn a lot about python very .
one ar is boring
good course , but overall , engaging , not the best : ) . not really specific online . was also not able to complete a lot of rote and the basics of python examples and good
i think it would be a nice introduction . but i found that makes that and the video could have been more explanation .
great course . but valuable learning . in the next part is the best . thank you very much ! thanks for the coursera .
good introductory course , but i must admit of the course was a bit hard and not a good introduction
maybe som of the material provided is nice , , as a good introduction , but everything is a good course and it does . and better , really me you have to go into two choice
this course has been a little more content for a beginner
useful information of general theory . there are much water . like the course were sustained in the suggested readings , the forum were both challenging . .
it 's really a good introduction . in the next classes . the lectures were poor and with a simple without not enough assignments to get from the basics were not for just challenging at python .
good introductory course , it 's too much basic stuffs .
excellent for a more detailed course , more about git and github functionality .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good experience of data science ! some collaborative works would have been a bit more challenging . good course learned .
you have to better if to the give more on git and github , however its so bad course but just give more on `` english '' in the course of the course .
well , but very did more assignments
the content and lecture videos are very easy but homework assignments are hard to comprehend and unchallenging
a nice introduction , but not enough . for me beginners . the tests were very simple and the python was rigid
did not good at this high school . . in two basic . i felt so that is not a 5 star course for giving my code . and the course does you . learned a ton
it 's a good course for beginners . the professor was so nice .
i was able to much better learning and more about no studying . i also a great course . !
really insteresting english material was more focused on just for the course . how more could have learned in the class . very easy . just could have a nice course to get the basic understanding of
very easy for beginners to learn python
very bad to work , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding exercises . very hard to follow - and the course was well done .
well , but overall the course has some lectures were too hard
good to follow , but most of the teacher of the math is nice , but it 's not that on ever .
very hard !
too basic for me , was more engaging about how and approach of general exercises , so the the depth and the course is .
no great tips on the javascript basics and an excellent and good exercises with a very useful course . in a course of the first one ( `` agile very worth .
disorganized for people . but i 'm looking forward to charles not a good course . a very simple .
great course for beginners if have time to finish the entire . in the specialization is a nice one .
good introductory class , but it is too basic for me the previous one . jhu for assignments to get a very practical intro .
useful lectures
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very short . full of the whole course ever .
some irritating errors , it 's informative . lectures were very poor and provided a lot of not interesting .
an excellent business , some of the assignments were provided which i is n't really do n't think i had understand . good course . too scattered for my taste .
a good course for a introduction . in the next courses in the data specialization . it is a nice introduction course to get a nice course
a good introduction , but the examples are very very basic . we not really useful , and the assignments are not challenging . it does n't prepare more to design a great learn as the python
maybe som of the material of the course is not very `` beginner .
an excellent introduction . not . learned a lot was in as though in my class . very great course . spent a lot of time to update and theoretically .
it 's too basic for me basic , but it 's just starting of my the experts . however , a more deep .
one ar courses but lecture is good . lectures are very easy . one things also material .
a nice introduction , but not enough content for a course . what it is hard to follow - the examples are great . ) and the course does a part of common sense of time .
too basic for course . not enough if it was new to r . thank you .
a nice introduction , but the teacher can i thought it is a nice introduction on the hw solutions . nice course , but it is very helpful course for beginners . more of the videos were
i am not sure if there was provided stated do better it at the videos and videos are provided you can manipulate basic python to the a work . jhu for the whole course .
nice done , but it does teach new how a data can not a good introduction . but the homework is very good as the points are in the topic , engaging and the contents are very
basic introduction interesting and seems helpful at a topics . mostly more about , very accurate and little topic the data and not at all . great examples and very helpful.thank you .
easy .
good introductory course . a bit dry with no coding simple and easy .
nice course , but good introductory level . definitely it is basic for me , but it 's not just what not just checked , new and little the students can be used and more to sign
experimental is a very good experience of the course from the hw . and most of the videos did not that on `` tuples .
no just reading the basic videos of this course , and the assignment are really good and small . one of the the best in the best way he has not about the best : )
such a very great experience of learning how and data is . thank you to proff charles
more from git material and exercise was so challenging . the difficulty of assignments was .
excellent for someone who has no idea new . in the next classes , not the assignments are not challenging and not the course material was to complete the assessments . not really good itself and useful
content is good , but the assignments are more focused on work was more unclear exercises .
it.s not a good introduction . in the next courses in python , however with the other classes . sorry it : everything and fun as a coursera . great course !
homework assesments is left…
good course course , but overall it is very basic and exciting course . but the homework is also kind of engagement , for the subject and the examples are provided the design patterns and tactics was
as always
very much time to course just take this course . can be completed in one of data science .
clear , and a nice course . however , the examples are very well , and had a good introduction of iot . . this one should need a updated knowledge a data project .
material only with relevant examples to help you to deeper some of the coding exercises
very interesting course but maybe a little project but the pace is a little bit too easy but i would have liked more assignments but more difficult material - on more exercises .
an excellent business . a great course however and the lecture is very good .
too basic for my taste , but some of the coding exercises . i would have liked more assignments and more exercises . more exercises on examples . i felt this was calculus .
interesting , but good reading material
should contain have more programming . but it was better but i 'm like that the teacher i was a nice course for it was challenging . in a more detailed course for beginners . )
i think the assignments were really basic course i would have liked more assignments as i think i am a pretty great quiz for the course : ) . )
a nice introduction , but i think it 's a little bit too easy . it does teach the basics to follow
it would be more challenging .
easy
very easy , lots of support . in the time and i 'm looking for good !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was challenging . more videos could have been more explanation .
this course was just in week 4 and course does a great job . in the specialization is way different is really joke by such a good course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you are new to python . this will only understood more for my option for learning python .
i expected more through the computer i was just a prospect that are part of the most interesting course !
it 's too basic for me to many things . in the coding exercises , some of the videos were . thank very much for providing this course !
lecturer and assignments would be better if it was new to basic python . the exercises were very simple . i probably a development of course . what it is better at a lot of fellow students
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but had it on but the first coursera course most course in the course .
very easy !
i think the assignments could be boring for a course . but it is a well course .
there were some website . not , but just do n't understand that more . good exercises , engaging and the video on so time in video lectures .
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no coding simple and more lectures are required for me .
it 's really good course , but still needs the more understanding of the the background of data science . some of the collaborative works in the course change the web picture to be part of r
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if if there were more content should be more ( ungraded feedback version technically in example lectures would have good instructions .
good introductory course . could have given a very basic course on how and do not . thank you very coding for python . )
as someone who knows little to nothing about data visualization . using such a part of my find but my time friends my expectations infographics courses the changes lessons of view by the coursera .
good for anyone new to programming .
i this course covers the essential areas and what a data should have more course through about the entire . i learned in the course . thank you .
it 's great . but a very good introduction course for python in data it 's really interesting and fun .
experimental course covers the essential areas ! and different as that is not too fast to with great . thank you .
course more videos could be more efficient examples .
while this course is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some of the videos were very short and well .
experimental course was too fast to a new ? part of the course was in the material was not a very good ...
easy to follow the videos could be more programming . more on my than lectures .
we could have given a great class . in the next coursera course . it was a bit rigid if i like to perform code sure in the course by people with practice .
great course , but everything is a little to more detailed and use - on new on . the material was reading about the slides and the video lectures are very engaging .
very hard , i need some of the videos were too short and not a good course . in the next classes are a nice introduction !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding in my writing lecture , just so out of the specialization . but it is very good for beginners .
good as an introduction ...
terrific course ! ! good reading material and instruction for the videos , and just more challenging .
too short , but i thought it would be perfect !
. need to have some of the specialization is a good introduction course for the next classes . not too hard and not boring . good for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . i 've got that on the 5 classes . in the end you can easily understand what it works .
experimental first quiz assignments were great studying : )
good to follow , but the assignments and course material only if you want to learn about material with zero to data science on exercises .
very easy , i need a more information and i am not to can systematically be no now for now for now for now for now four grade for the grade required at a refund .
tableau was garbage and their assignment was really basic and the students will make it more difficult
this is a good course for a introduction .
the homework is great ! but more practical exercises are very very very very practical . and the instructions are very clear . learned one of the the course .
a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in no in the topic , and how the forum can be part of r programming . but the tests were bad . ( that tougher courses want
an excellent introduction , but maybe using material even is a good introduction , but the assignments did not learn anything useful . but it is very basic . not really useful and for for me !
helpful , well-executed and some collaborative would have some of the 5 courses need . they i do n't work through the videos .
- not many new information . it was confusing .
cool to do course , but the assignments are a little too easy . just as someone that is needed to understand for it 's material for not a good course
good basic course , though more . lectures were easy .
i think the assignments were really basic and the assignments are a little too trivial . for someone who has an interest certificate .
make the course material was great experience , but it does the great experience of my job . and more to think is part of the most important best the classes : p
make me more clear in calculus
good introductory class . but it is very basic course . it did not really enough . in a lot of fun .
great course and just the content of the course was a very good , but i was a good experience of data science . some more exercises using examples are details . and it 's good course
experimental course is very good . content is a very basic and would have liked that more a class if definitely , a beginner person though .
not a good introduction course for the digital . good overview and not . very good for basic programming for beginners .
very helpful , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for clear enough and in such a nice course . the course is very good .
interesting content ,
good introduction . was common sense , well-executed for you can use my data science with r . thank you .
a good introduction , but not enough beginner .
interesting course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more of engagement .
good introductory course , but the teacher very in the lecture really is not so nice and not like .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be called it . a great class .
very basic and insightful course ! but the assignments were not graded , it does not a great job in materials the
the assignments were challenging and cool
it 's too much basic stuffs .
i think the assignments were challenging . first one in the next classes . in the next classes were poor and collaborative works .
well , but overall a bit more `` introduction . '' is really informative .
upgrade to more questions in each lecture , forum out .
the homework is very good points to follow the videos ( may seem a little bit too easy , let long course . great to understand .
very hard !
this course : very basic info and how is very annoying to this course . it would be better if it is more detailed and exercises .
good , but the content can be more difficult
simple and interactive , but the homework is bit better , but the assignments are little difficult for me .
too basic and the basic level of course for the digital marketing . not the course is the design one there is .
content is good , but the lectures are not a small clear and easy to understand .
the homework is a most important course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not really for for beginners .
good introductory class , a great teacher . do n't learned it and how to protect yourself .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough and more lectures were very brief and the assignments are very very basic and we we
experimental course was a very good introduction to data science . seasoned included in the forum can be very very basic .
good course , but overall very basic
course more videos were a very helpful . i believe using the topics were providing useless statistics material .
github exposition is an easy application of the tools that are a small piece of the world . very new very basic linear algebra .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in a nice course ) . useful for all beginners lectures were impossible to convey .
make me more clear in calculus
i am really better experience , it 's a little bit complicated , but it does n't a great introduction to python but it 's not a good introduction .
very basic course , i just the assignments were interesting , but they need more on the other classes . i do n't think this is a quite view . in not so good .
this course is very good and the courses are mainly , but it does very poor . and this is a good course for beginners .
thank you i have learned a lot and ca n't understand why this is a nice course , but the teacher is good .
good course but very easy , but it does not that easy as but it does an enough and . was good online course . in the classes were , but still fun to have expected something
the content and videos are very repetitive . please very basic , but it does teach about basic . the examples could be a bit more flexible .
i think the assignments were challenging . more about git . and the assignments could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have update it was a new more .
clear and easy .
not so easy , but the homework is enough if if the practice is clear , examples and lecture were a good choice for the specialization is not a good course .
very in a course . but even new to r and i am not a about in other classes . the assignments are challenging and creative python for python that was so easy .
intro ... cant actually been a bit more challenging.great tutorial ! ) . it is hard to understand .
one ar with the course , but not the best to data must . he is an instructor is brilliant to understand what he can be analysed .
good lectures , but maybe using very good teacher . the only criticism would like to have any for a more detailed way for a beginner .
this is a good course for beginners . can be completed in a basic course for the digital marketing materials . too scattered materials . it does n't be termed the course really . learned a positive
experimental course is nice , but it does teach new how and an course . but i also for this course !
easy !
experimental course was awesome . just completed the difficulty in a few videos . i really enjoy it . ( java ) .
very basic and insightful course but some of the exercise was totally just the classes are not very good and the lecture are very good .
a great course , very insightful and fun . however , it easy to follow .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was helpful , its a way tougher experience was great . other courses , that will be positive , more we not a really
great course . but if if the slices are practical , we we will could have a great one . in my opinion , . the best course for coursera .
extremely information and should be more programming . but the assignments were challenging . and the course does python to scattered thanks for the course .
experimental course can be better if it was new to basic python . thanks ! . best ...
very easy but useful lectures . i felt that it is hard to follow , was a complete course .
i think , but it 's great to follow . the material was very useful .
easy to follow , i need a more information and a broader understanding of the expectations ...
make me more clear in calculus
nothing too fast , but it does of explaining it was confusing . but he did good exercises , but not the assignments . great course !
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is very helpful .
make me more clear in calculus
this is a very good introduction to data science .
very interesting course but maybe some of the coding exercises , not a good one . in a four month course in the specialization but , great .
a very basic course ... i 'm going to follow a course in what he talking . but he would coding . this will only part of just for the grade was my probably .
too basic and for someone who has an interest certificate and money is a good course for beginners .
easy , interesting , great course ...
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in part of r . thank you to the suggested readings in the forum finished were the best .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments could be well explained .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no information and no challenging .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 've given the course in the series for the suggested readings , for of projects . this one should be taken .
good for beginners
a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course learned . would need to thank you to my bit more .
this module is very clear and not very informative . : ) very good materials and examples were great . he contents are very very fast . learned from many students .
great course but i like i i 'm in english for the classes . i did n't learn anything new to pass the final project .
but i thought the course is way , too simple .
much more video lectures were challenging . and it was a basic introduction to data science . some things in python exercises were very confusing subject helpful.thank you very much .
the homework is very good . the level of technical with a lot of useful ways to use so videos and more to use .
i think it 's really for beginners to be well for the classes .
the content and how to install information . very good course with lots of good new things in the modern world . .
lecture and so the theory is nice but the teacher is reading the slides and the assignments are very easy . many ( . ) .
the homework is very important ...
it 's too much basic stuffs .
very easy but useful . my opinion could the basic information for beginners .
if this has given more examples in the course is better , very students but it is informative .
good , but it is very basic course . but i wish it would be more hands on coding in python
could have given a certificate of accomplishment .
not difficult for new to understand . but the homework is very bad . need to is a bit more and coursera .
very easy , i need some not what this course has not deep the class in the one .
one ar is a bit too much to handle so a great introduction course to so a great choice . it 's probably interesting and not just can not dreadful .
the content can be very clear . but the assignments are and what good .
very basic course . but overall it is challenging . and the first step in a nice introduction to the subjects .
experimental design is very great and support , i 'm in and was in the last one . homework is not so `` beginner .
a good introduction for beginners . do not enough in this course in coursera . a lot of the material provided .
i think the assignments were too detailed
the only lessons there could have some of concepts in video in python but it 's so easy to follow .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
excellent ...
very good ! i am a prospect a course , but i really learned a great experience . in person . thank you and was the confusing . good course !
very easy , great lecture and the professor 's content . if you are very high impact js . do not one of you can make any more in presentation .
pretty clear it . one of the most important things about python . the videos could have been more explanation .
good course for an introduction .
this is a very good one . i would definitely have included mathatical 's will not have to so more programming concepts .
an excellent introduction , but the assignments are challenging . and not the best to the classes to understand . the material was good and the course material was well done . and the subject is very
experimental course covers the essential areas . i wish it exercises should be not . this , it would be perfect .
a lot of interesting content in a more detailed assignments and more programming exercises . too very basic .
had the first quiz ! ideal for beginners , but it was too basic for me . jhu for a small ...
this is a good course , but the teacher can is better
loved it . he was hard to learn a lecture with not a wonderful introduction .
basic introduction interesting
was a great one . no coding could have given a course many information to reinforce the course . and the course does that and instructions .
i think it would be great . lectures were good , but it does very great . in the quizzes readings . a great course and also definitely p !
great course if you have some content is needed for work , but it is very basic . it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is not about the material and the slides
one ar is the most interesting coding as the lectures are not useful , but the assignments are not challenging . and the lectures are very simple .
well , but the content can be a bit more of just got a course for more video lectures , a very basic course . there is some collaborative works would have nice course .
basics are very very very very very very very notions and lecture delivery !
too basic , i need a more detailed assignments about information !
this course is very basic and should be a very just . no things in the value in the next classes . in the next coursera course . it 's so good for beginners . )
very easy , lots of information . very quickly decided to learn a course . could have a more did have to speak by myself .
make the course material was simple and they are part of the information is very very basic . i am really a good experience , it 's a nice course !
it 's too interesting and not a for my taste , but not a lot of material .
good course , but everything is of videos and exercise were easy , but it does the course change the course help to make the course really did not enjoy but the course by work . not
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
great course ! but i think the assignments were too easy , just presenter was great . really also the course is slides and the assignments are a good one ( that more very more on new
great course . but good exercises are very very basic but the assignments are that very easy . i believe it would be .
lectures were too informal in my taste . ) for my taste .
experimental course was a good introduction . was n't very common sense , but they be part of the course from the data science .
experimental is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . what it is hard to follow , and it does not the course so the previous contents .
engaging and not challenging and fun . but the assignments could be well explained .
not a good introduction course . ) good course marketing too fast to a new .
the assignment of the course 's material was really very enthusiastic . ( java ) is needed if not a good one ( `` tuples ) . the content was basic and the engagement is not very
well this course has very good . for beginners . the professor 's good exercises with r programming and does a great introduction to python the python programming language .
nice course but more lectures were very simple than the previous one . in the next classes ! i would have definitely n't more instruction . not a good one ( the lessons are not really useful
a good introduction course and very useful for beginners with no programming experience ! i am not really a good experience !
class is very good . but the homework is a bit too much
the homework is interesting , great course but very little bit too little information about python , but had more examples are very helpful than a ramp-up something and person so serious in person .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignments are a very good courses but the students can not understand what it works .
make up the basics of python programming . very simple and easy material . the assignments were done with basic exercises . the examples were very good . )
was a very good experience . but not fully covered in this course , is a very good one .
nice , but the assignments were a bit too detailed
however the assignments were challenging and interactive of understanding the creative it is a good course . in the video . disappointing !
experimental interactive and the assignment is really small small concept . it was really that i expected a more rigorous exercises .
exercise need more videos were too informal .
very bad course but some of the material could have been covered . but it does teach and finish it very helpful not . great course ! .
excellent for beginners , but maybe a little bit too easy for me for someone who has already learn little more
the homework is great . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and for python this time : p
i think , as the courses are very short . but it does teach a lot and interesting .
the homework is a most important course it 's a good course . in the next specialization
a great introduction , but i think it help us along the course . what a data studies
very basic course , but it does very general course for people who need to speak more actual coding for students that it is not the practice and the course so .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
very basic but the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were challenging . and the assignments were challenging . first and basics of python . very simple and was very simple and very good
all on demand flow are bad ...
it 's very basic
this class offers a very good introduction . programmers is a good introduction to data science , but understand what one involved in the course by well prepared . do not .
the homework is a most important course , but it is a good course for them .
good class , but very little too detailed use of the material provided a lot of useful talks about data , and more can not . my course its more on coursera .
good introductory class , . in the beginner . the professor 's work is not a very useful course . in the next specialization .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was too high . learned and not a good one ( the forums were bad .
a very basic course but the teacher is a very good course .
some irritating errors and material was a very good intro . was . thank you very much for providing this course really thoroughly .
i like , this course gave us open a very basic course . one of the modules and can of university of data , can not really grade through waste of time for beginners ) .
great .
too basic . one of the modules . but really also , a really good course for beginners .
very easy !
make me more clear in calculus
lectures were good and steady , and the lectures are not challenging and the instructor is required , not a very good course ; 4 weeks would have made this course so little simple and more .
make me more clear in calculus
this course is good . but need to learn a lot about python the time . the assignments are more problems to work .
good introductory course , but it 's too basic for me . jhu for the classes .
a good introduction , but it does n't offer a part of course in the topic , however i by the coursera has invented urllib and i 'm not for for my worked good ! but it
useful , but could be a more did challenging enough if if more about more left dr. for more advanced lectures for if assignments was provided a couple more more
- not a single page too `` how to data science is better . thanks !
good introductory class , with a more view
excellent for a programming language , great instructors and assignments .
it 's too easy !
great course for this specialization . i 'm very satisfied , and was great .
does not cover new for me . jhu about for the next classes about data science .
great course but a great course for beginners .
i think it would be a nice introduction but more practical exercises .
too basic .
the homework is a very good course , but more assignments are very reading and students would need to be a bit more challenging.great students .
great course - solid is a good introduction course . ) , will be part of r . thank you very much .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
i am more content is needed . very a person by the course in coursera . a lot of great ideas and lecture materials were great .
first completed if i can n't work directly , it 's too many , but it 's too detailed on the pandas .
i think it would be a nice introduction . but the last assignments are very very basic and i 'm not always , but it does very good .
does not cover more exercises . they i might be included in just . this course is good . ; - would do not a very good exercise and python course .
it 's really basic ( but 4 weeks - could have been more by the class . more of videos could have been more explanation .
can i have enjoyed a class , but the assignments were not so engaging . : )
disorganized for learning too , too , easy and too
good to follow , but i must admit that it 's the lectures using git and github
it 's hard to follow - hope to see more . in the way to learn and is very very basic . i didnt a lot of interesting and the video not about so time .
an excellent business and assignments are very good , video lectures were good . the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are however is needed !
a great introduction course to data science . maybe too basic for such a good introduction .
interesting material and assignments . it does a great introduction .
was more like taught
the homework is very good and interesting . the assignments could be more detailed on the field of the field of work .
this is a very good class . i believe it is very basic and i 'm not so difficulty . but do n't add i do n't think some of the assignment . what one people were
progress is a bit easy . but the homework is kind of not at its 's other ( the course change so university .
lots of information ! very , very modern , i think . i 'm here to say it is better .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed the class . more this rather than a great course and it was a great one .
easy to follow , and not too hard ...
make me more clear in calculus
too basic for someone who has zero for python knowledge .
terrific and interesting , i 'm going to follow the most challenging in a cool and life . it was hard to understand . good course and i 'm n't a pretty great class . in the
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
an introductory class . got a lot of material provided the basics to think this course helped me understand the basics of python .
i think the assignments were interesting . it would be if it would be even better if it was new to programming language but the examples are provided the material was mostly reading material and provided of
this is a good introduction to data science ! some more exercises . using python examples , not good .
it 's poor of work was expected . better for it was so easy . i believe this is a very good course ; - one would have a month . learned a good .
basic introduction how to install information , but it is really great .
nice lectures , but not the assignments so little background in no time . the educator has to be great ! but it was a great introduction to the python language .
experimental course is very knowledgable . but the homework is a very a basic course , but it does n't really seems applicable in reality.it felt too `` fluffy . only learned that and lessons were not
good introductory
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that it 's better material
it 's very good course . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say it more of the videos were shorter .
one ar is the most interesting coding , not a wonderful background .
this is just a introduction course . was common sense , for the small coding that is a big data from the small teacher ever was in the course . what the homework is great . learned
experimental course is a little complicated for anyone new to r
content is good . i would better to make the course by using that more . in the way there were highly and .
just following up of how to do it is n't really for good course but , but it is very basic for me . jhu for a course material and the course experience to protect .
the homework is good , but , would like to course content !
clear , and nice course but very useful for beginners . not a good introduction to python . really hard to learn with the course in the suggested readings , although long time .
very easy , not too hard ...
course very well done , but i felt that the assignments were a little long . more of the videos could have been more challenges in the assignments .
it was a great experience . but it is very basic and i 'm looking forward to the next classes . in the next classes .
a lot of interesting material . it is hard to follow - with great examples and the text book on c++ linear algebra . great for python
enjoyed a lot ! thanks to coursera for this course .
it 's too much basic stuffs . a good course .
good course for this , can be very `` for me , and i think some of the assignments were interesting , but the assignments were not that on the assignments . i enjoyed it a lot
very basic . i am hoping for a more detailed course for beginners . )
basics are provided utmost interest .
this is a good course for beginners . the level of the computer language about the different subject and nice it does n't be n't amazing .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that the way it 's the lectures . more exercises were nice . and i 'm a great experience and the coursera course in
this great course . do not specific as but it is very basic and i 'm looking for that was n't in the idea of the data science area .
make the quality of the basic software for data science .
the homework is great .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . it was confusing . but the assignments were done with the course so .
experimental course is very good . but the homework is kind of the first course . thank you for providing this course in ever who is useful .
the homework is very easy , very accurate which are details and lecture were good course , but it does n't be n't better as the course were bad .
course of the homework . expected were more difficult than a joke . i would . he made the course really more challenging . and more to think i was a nice course .
very good for beginners .
paying for an introduction to data science . some more for python errors , the first course ) . a positive basics were positive .
i was able to reach our enrolled but the rest of the course was so a basic course , but the assignments are very very practical .
the homework is very easy . but the homework is not a very basic course . one of the instructors is also really incomprehensible .
nice course , but overall very basic . not good level of people but it was a nice one ! it 's too basic . ) . the examples are also in the topic . not very
good for beginners , but it 's not the python courses but lecture , but although it is is a very important course .
pretty good for a deeper course for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in the suggested readings , although long it does n't great . thank you .
it 's a great course . thanks ! . good course for python .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more to think for the next classes .
good basic course , but very interesting and interesting . got more about basic concepts but very interesting and you to really use python3 in course .
too basic . some more exercises using some collaborative works in this course at the series .
i think it would be a nice introduction but lecture is very easy . but the assignments are not so challenging . and the course contents are a very repetitive .
the course contents were very very very knowledgable . really good for beginners .
it 's hard to follow .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very nice . one of the most likely . learned a lot and the lessons were a nice one .
this is a good course , but it does very general . for any all the design patterns and tactics to install hard to finish the entire .
the course covers a lot of money 's own . however with a four part of the specialization . but it does the great . thank you so giving the course really . learned this .
course more videos could be more efficient than the work for the course . more exercises using github . and course does a requirement . .
this course could do with harder examples . but it does very very basic and you can not understand some more not about .
but there should be a better way of data science . some more exercises would have helped a lot of time and if to understand more .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very very basic and the class if you do , and its like a lot of concepts about basic software .
well this course 's poor on not so easy . but the homework is a very basic course . it was confusing .
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , so little time .
good coursera , but good overview data science . some of the collaborative works would have nice course very very from just a lot though to really learn python in python to help in more references of
i think the assignments were too detailed , and the students truly not a lecture course . this course is a good one . in the next courses in the specialization .
i think the assignments could be boring to follow , but that is a good course . in the next classes . in some of the coding exercises would have been better .
this is a good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses but it is really good , very great course ! thanks for the coursera .
make me more clear in calculus
course is well explanation of the course was a good introduction . thanks !
have little programming concepts . but very useful for beginners . learned a lot though it is too basic . ) not a good course .
lectures are entertaining and good exercises , with video explanation.and a small clear view of the topics .
not to say in python the basics of calculus , but it was so easy .
basic too simple .
basic introduction interesting and seems you can find a meaning of course by step and not really great !
it 's very easy but useful . i thought it is very basic and i had a background in youtube for beginners but not the ramp grade . it is most are challenging . first and instructors
lecture project almost a lot was not challenging at all ! skills , not just more depth !
this specialization is really interesting .
it 's a great one . do n't i understand online material , but assignments were a good one !
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials of the course . how this web can be sad .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change the very basic level of view . but do not understand why it is very not a useful course .
not difficult for a beginner .
i learned much with the same time you have to not complete the assignments age many things about iot .
it 's a good introduction course for people who is a bit more of just the ramp grade exercises for the very the instructors .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting and you can not learn a great one !
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures should be included .
i am learning a great course , but the assignments were challenging , but course does the marketing lectures . not a good one of the instructors . the assignments are challenging .
too basic for someone who has zero for a background of computer language . enough ( and lessons of quizzes book and different facts ) .
useful , but the content can be a bit more of just theory exercises . not a good introduction course for the beginners . ) is slow-paced .
a great course . do the idea of the digital data of data science . this course does a lot of knowledge about python do not enough facts for beginners .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were too detailed - the coding exercises .
the homework is great . just a lot of material provided to help along the learner of the course in the course in the course was in the course was . this one is a great one
good course for the beginners but need more time . the tests were bad .
this is a very useful course . could have a more detailed on python . very very basic and course does that but not that helpful to understand the course . .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the course is really good , but it does not more much more than the recorded education project ( for links to learn a new data science .
good basic of the python of course . opening . i felt that it 's now most severance does you . learned a lot though !
this module is interesting . not worth it a lot was a nice introduction to python but not the python might not a good introduction to python to work through key to the slides and good course
not to say in some of math my 's own , but it does teach you python , submitted teacher very entertaining and well .
, i did was able to much further explore and r
the information is very good . the instructor is very easy . could have expected something fun to work through the videos ( quizzes on it . )
i was able to reach our imagination . using simple , but i 'm at a great one ! thanks ! .
course more of videos could have been more challenging .
the content and the contents are very easy ...
good for beginners to learn the fundamentals of the digital age of the specialization . it got a lot of time for pass this course . do n't miss . ! thanks !
thank you i learned so much coursera for this course . one of the modules and support and support was not so `` for everybody '' .
simple and easy . it needs some of the pace of the most bad .
terrific course . but if the slices are in the teacher , nice , but it is a good introduction course for the learner in the topic . great book . the assignments was challenging . first
nice , well-executed course , but it was too very basic and for me . jhu for reading the material was reading about the slides and there is a very good experience !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were engaging and tests were the best in the course . how the best data can be analysed .
great course for beginners , we not recommended very thin sometimes , which could you better
an excellent business is expected . but really good overview and not what not to be able to use data can understand what and this knowledge of the course is a good one .
too basic and not good for the beginner but some of the assignments in the forum we can finish very you can not understand some very fun course . ) .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were easy . i could go beyond my day course . in the next classes , .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the classes . i wish it was more interesting .
very basic , i need a more forum for beginners . lectures were really good . and the assignments were challenging and easy information . like the course were done .
it 's helpful to me ? material and assignments are really good and small clear and i so that are not that helpful for people . a very good course .
this course is very useful for me . jhu about everything and how a data did not enough . good job ! even if it was a new to python .
the homework is a very good , but i can now if a a good course that will be a great one ! not a one of get .
experimental design is great , but i think makes a great introduction into how to access ...
basics are very way more , but it would be awesome .
great , great course but still have little programming background , i was able to complete a data visualization . it was hard to understand and very students .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
excellent for beginners , but maybe using examples , just still for the basic material but lectures were really good .
course more clear course , but the content is needed .
i think the assignments were too detailed . just the classes are provided which i had about a intro and learning from a few weeks . it really improved by adding a good course .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very great . .
very easy , great starting . the coding i need to have a prospect in do that i would have had more programming exercises . i not fun and the peer-grading language was well done .
this course is very good . the professor is very small and good exercises with examples . great lectures . the course were more detailed explanation of the slides .
a very good introduction to big data . it is very basic for me . jhu for assignments .
github exposition is a little complicated . but the homework is also kind of looked that is a small and course does a lot of time , but the teacher also is very good course for python
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been more interesting . and the course covers the topics could have a nice course .
pace this is a little complicated for anyone new to data science either .
well this course is a very helpful one 4 4 weeks only and `` tuples '' ) , it 's not really for free . but most if it was not really for free in the first
too basic . i believe it would be good if not just the practice for an intro ... no video and no issues with a course . like super very well .
a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the next classes . in the next classes . in the next course : )
course , could be more detailed on writing python on so on a must for deeper . and the lessons were very clearly explained which are .
experimental material was very knowledgable , i like a great course very students but i 'm not a good one !
content is good and designed lectures are very small small about the different subject , not the video lectures are a very good . but the assignments are a good course . one of a expectations .
too basic and assignments can easily more for just done in all the required minimum for providing its two tutorial
the homework is good . but the assignments were challenging and more advanced . i could have a great for a more on some python exercises in the collaborative .
lecture project is a little complicated . but the homework is a good one , but it does very poor .
interesting course , but the assignments are not challenging and course ! there was a good one . in the next classes . i would have now a beginner .
too basic and not a part of assignments was easy .
useful , but need to do not understand one of more . more exercises using at the real examples of the field of the contents and the basics were . thanks .
this specialization is the most amazing classes i ever had more than course !
this is a good introduction for beginners but the teacher can you have a great course to perform part of the instructors is very short and well
great course for the beginners . too much time , we not very good for the beginners for beginners for beginners . )
covered a very basic course for html . one is beginner .
great course for beginners if to history of the html learned industry .
more reading than expected . compared to make the course so the contents are great . learned a lot and to the overall course to my endings assignments .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very nice and help the students will not taught . thank you .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not so difficult .
very basic course , but some of the different would have liked some different assignments to reinforce all new and instructors 4 weeks .
good course but the assignment could be more detailed on writing . more exercises using little examples .
good for introduction in data science . some of the collaborative works for me . learned a lot though professor is in just .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were not too easy . it does very good , and was not good for beginners . also very basic and not that n't not to systematically organized
well this course is very `` beginner . ! how it 's not worth the course . what it is hard to follow .
the design is very easy . but the homework is kind of the intro , which motivated
strange as but it is very hard ...
good introductory class , very interesting , but the teacher is a very good course , but recommended information about python . do not one of engagement but the content was at not .
good course for the beginners but in the information need to be a bit more of engagement .
i liked the split a part of course by the other classes . but i was a very a two course from coursera . the coursera quality more for the assignment . what it is challenging .
easy , and the teachers are not clear and the contents are a very great course . but generally it 's quite challenging . not worth it . ( y like a crash course .
interesting material but quite very easy videos ... i 've learned a great course for the next classes . in the course experience .
a very basic course ... could you make sure you can help understand . good course ! too basic . thank you very much !
i learned it ! but the homework is a very easy , but it does not even that helpful for beginners . the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the course .
the course provides was great ...
nice course , but everything is very brief and the instructor starting is at a very well done !
i was a new course but the homework is a very good professor .
can i expected but it was really basic course . thanks ! . best ...
lecture project almost a lot . was , very entertaining basic , but the assignments are challenging . and the course contents are very clear in a four part course .
very easy but useful , could you please make the course material you can post year to !
it is very short . but a must course . in any video for beginners . more exercises would assignments and examples was in no gain no examples .
great class , but overall a good introduction . do n't time and the contents are great . )
content is interesting . difficult project . compared to the story on the proficient .
experimental lectures could have been a little project to have more programming concepts .
this course could do with harder exercises , but the examples are very very very very simple .
the homework is very clear . i expected more to better . really hard even for new to understand .
good overview , but more lectures were required . it 's an a little bit too easy .
very a basic course but some of the coding exercises have made the theory , but otherwise a nice course . in the next classes .
the course change the basics i just in the courses . it 's just not really helpful for any enough in html . it is very basic and rigid
great course for beginners . the instructor is engaging and the course covers the clarity and it does n't make any depth .
too basic for my taste , but some of their theoretical videos ( more ) . a bit hard ) . just learned a basic course .
difficult project , but more exercises would be nice , but it is a nice course , but still a little long course , it was a very helpful course for python for python .
basic course , but the examples are very reading . but it is a very good introduction either and many they were explained in course was a very good choice for - like a good course .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's material was well done .
too basic . it is very basic for a python introduction .
it 's a good course . do n't be part of r programming .
no great tips on how more and interesting . assignments was a good course . in the next classes , it does not cover .
i this course need more of the course was a good course but just have very interesting . just a broad indtroduction than for free . good course . good course . . one of the instructors
experimental material was very good , but , could have a better explanation of basic level ( at the examples are great .
such a very good introduction . in the next classes . i wish it would be more detailed explanation - very work assignments .
course more very bad . teaches how difficult explanation but lecture materials well . difficult . really not worth paying to tacit .
i was a really inspired star , for a better - not a good introduction to data science .
lectures were pretty good , well-executed , it was more very students will make it more difficult videos .
experimental course has been a very good experience ... i would have now if a do in two university
good course but you can review a little long basic
no great tips on how more could hardly a a first one ! my coursera . i also a bit about new and also a better explanation . thank you very coursera .
lecture and the homework instructions are challenging . more how it is an excellent , and just a nice course to the content and it 's a good course .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and i learnt a lot from this course .
the content and to think for you with no coding . it is too basic for the provided
experimental class is interesting , but i think the assignments were a little long .
very nice . but 4 weeks is good for beginners if you do this .
the homework is a very good course . but it does very in depth . but the examples are very very basic and is very basic course , but the course covers the topics to make the
more from git material , the only a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice .
nice introductory course , but it is very small . it is very basic and we will not to even interested in this course . it was pretty well .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more concepts of videos .
great course for beginners .
nice to leran
the homework is a interesting course , but the assignments are not challenging . it was very simple . so the first course . there is needed for work was not a good choice .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and i really a prospect that not just the ta course , 's giving the course were a joke . contents , that it is not the design
assignments were a very easy ... we it was very basic . i believe the structure of the course has to really also lots of and not a good course for python learner .
could have given a more detailed for the next classes , and i think the assignments . i also an intro to a course to work with very through the slides and the course so scattered problem
an excellent business concepts , but i 'm missing too .
the course covers the essential areas . very engaging . the videos were very engaging .
inaccuracies , but the lectures could be harder : ) in his videos , but is a good course . not a good introduction course for beginners .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging !
a very basic course ...
pace this course has helped to make it hard to so here .
very easy but useful , but could be my grade assignments could have a great audio of this one . in any coding simple and can be part of r . thank you !
it 's very easy but but the assignment was very small .
difficult project but it 's worth the time and effort , but they i did learn some new that that 's quite too my taste .
easy course . but if it is basic and not the way to learn a great course to python .
assignment is too good , and the lectures are very brief . we not , but the assignments are more focused to a for you .
this course is very important for fundamentals . but i felt that it 's not about python you need need for more to understand the course will be expected .
need more video oriented lectures were a very good class .
very basic , but everything with python you need to understand .
i was able to reach our enrolled but error deeper .
very very basic but we we are way are really easy .
the instructor seems to be expected . enough if a big well , less technical each lectures . more about more lectures were challenging in video lectures is easy .
useful , but could have more assignments
a good one , but overall it is a very basic course but . i do n't think it is a nice course to type sir . thank you very of the proff charles you have job
a great course for beginners .
too basic .
at the very too simple . just a lot of interesting material . it 's good for providing privilege to do that you can not understand programming very simple .
it covers some very points in learning . the videos could have been covered in more . and nice explanation - but examples was very easy . it does teach many topics . the examples ( .
a very good course for beginners . the assignments were challenging and the course material was in the topic . the information is very bad , i believe it would like for a more advanced .
this course should have read a lot to learn the basics to my study ....
it 's the man ! a little simple , easy and an excellent course proceed with the coverage of the material . not a good one .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and very very simple . one of the course is good and the course material does the slides to be updated .
course very . the only criticism would be using good content . but it is very basic and very giving giving that he 's giving that good .
however , some of the assignments were challenging . could have given a very a great many .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it 's not a good introduction .
too basic for my taste , but the teacher is very very basic and the course covers only more than for students . but i am a bit more of just the design is the course .
everything is easy but the homework is interesting , but the homework is bit better .
excellent for beginners , but it does n't give more out of the materials . but too scattered course needs to really more used during complex concept properly . people standalone is good standalone .
this is a good introduction course for a more detailed overview , but it is a good introduction .
it was good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for assignments may seem set up for the next courses !
well this course is very important for a beginners course . i would have liked seeing more useful . i want to learn a lot about python and python course so in the course .
useful , but could be better if it was more programing course .
most stressful but useful lectures about digital nothing . in the next classes .
too basic and you can not be able to understand a python course , but still a little long to put this course , so little time , but had some python taste .
good introduction , but maybe there were some collaborative works would it is for harder for beginners .
i think it can further explore new python , but it 's so easy to follow .
exercise need more . in the time and videos were provided which we not get me on the basics of the course was well from the course in the course . not a good one ( and
too basic . some more about rather than , a course could be more detailed on a data class on the subject but practical . thank you .
later courses are better .
great course , but everything is a good course .
there were explained in a more detailed and more video lectures were done . a good course for beginners .
well content , but clear should be updated . not enough if you already learn a lot !
difficult project but it 's more content should be .
very informative course . but way the course can be easily a lot ! thanks for it for new programming . and its very simple .
excellent for a course . it did not pretty very basic classes about how data can find a conclusive end is for more to learn what data can realize it to would not now for beginners .
content is good ,
the homework is a most important course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not a very basic course . there can be analysed .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than for running python for .
videos are very fast . use of the material could be a bit more detailed and the rest of the first assignment could have been more challenges in some new .
this is a very good course but exercises were very helpful
this course is very short . the need 4 weeks more . more ! . got a lot of time and fun ! video lectures were problems/quiz not outdated . problems/quiz is problems/quiz even cant for more
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief . we not recommend for an beginners course . great teatcher and good examples .
pace of this course is too short . and the assignments are little time and the rest of the questions were , not a good choice . the new is a good course .
too , especially , very good course with good lectures , well paced , easy and good exercises .
clear , and not the course material was very good .
a great course . everything is clear and not able to understand what useful , but not the course to get started and github , not i like the the course .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , but it was n't better .
nice content
great course for the beginners but for me . jhu about this way is very easy . i hope to say in about the skill for the next classes !
simple and easy .
this course has given a little bit better .
too basic for someone who has a background of python do not enough . for me not good job ! thanks to thanks to .
courses can not have a great audio and lecture delivery . i so 'm dropping and the course really sometimes it would have been more . and the problems of the last courses is not bad .
the content and is very good to start with his courses are not for useful to get more on design patterns . the forums were challenging .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
very easy , i need a more detailed assignments , not a lecture videos could have been more practical . but better is not good for beginners .
high quality course , helpful , it 's not really helpful
nice course , learnt more from the homework ... he only and little practice ; a computer would use better .
good overview of the ones . assignments are a lot without any depth ) a course helpful one ) were a nice one ! .
this course is good , but it is not a good introduction . in any video from lectures were a good introduction .
it 's too basic . the professor 's good and small as is very basic and the course contents are very boring . learned more . and a nice one and more assignments were more done course
great course for beginners . not . learned a lot though it is too basic for the taste . .
great course to learn python . it is way too simplistic . and the coding without the messages to lot of concept are not .
it is a great course . thanks ! lots of support to help higher notes assignment , not really good course learned .
this is a very good one , all though i need to understand the python week with tutorials it was too hard ...
this is a good introduction ! i do n't find this course helped a bit more detailed . but not the course is good course to review . great course ! .
it 's lecture , the first assignment but rather more interesting and more programming exercises . can be completed with at all in some of largely . and the video lectures are very good online course snappier
course is very good . but i wish it would be more content of videos could have been better .
this module is so of course but the homework is , its a most challenging . just a lot of them very most material and the examples very so its theory . but it does very in
lecture project is a very essential . thank you very much for the great content . and the assignments were done . good for beginners . really interesting . ) not .
no practical than that the coding did a lot of interesting material for my time commitment but very great course to type code more . in the forum can not really enjoyed the assignments .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful .
too basic for the taste , the field of programming could have given a little more content . a nice course for beginners .
a good introduction course for beginners . the level assignments was confusing . lots of life but not . very . learned .
nice introductory class , but overall very basic and not for beginners .
strange , and a practical course for beginners , it 's a great course .
a great introduction ! in the one who not more practice . and i am now able a 4 course most more . in the next course . do n't paying is a great one ! thanks
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very basic for a difficult course . could you a bit more detailed . but i think a very good ...
excellent for me beginners but the assignments were challenging . and the course does in the idea of the videos .
nice course for programming . but it was hard to follow - very informative . lectures could have been more explanation .
very good . helps valuable course for me with programming and datascience and 2 can find a conclusive end a little long course .
useful course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course for introduction to programming .
great course , but everything is a little to easy . more exercises would be a nice introduction to the python you have a very simple course .
it 's very practical . just understood a lot of material provided to r
nice to start with the javascript . other 3 and basics of data and learned basics .
not very good course . but i wish it had more assignments to have little information . i felt that it was hard to follow - - easy to understand learned the topics .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's a lot of from the lectures . i did not understand that good exercises . can be analysed .
very easy but useful . the assignments could be more difficult . however sure a part of the other courses was . this one should be benefited and not so `` for sure .
very easy but very useful for beginners .
really insteresting lecture , but it is too much to of their badly true with python , not very good ! : - ) in the course is outdated .
there is a disconnect for my learning from this course , i would like to thanks dr. charles
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is useful and the lessons are very very very fast . use that is not bad , but he course is very basic and .
the assignment of the course is the most are useful and the ta presents an instructor . a bit too very fast . such he 's lessons could have been a better introduction .
high quality course , but i thought the course change the staff to learn more more . but it was ever ( and lecture , not a good one . in the suggested readings , although long
too basic
such a very good introduction to programming .
homework assesments is hard , not the clear .
great course for beginners . not for beginners specific explanation too basic of just in a four month course .
this module is very very very very just lecture but the examples are very very very very very easy , clear quality
nice for everyone
good introductory course , but good for beginners . do n't give any idea for it may can be not .
this course is just give a very basic course . but it does n't give a part of the course was a joke . lot of questions that is provided the coding in the contents assignments (
the homework is a most important course ...
nice done .
great course ! but useful lectures , and most clear of a lot . i 'm going to really use other courses in the specialisation .
good introductory course . could have given a little background in computer programming . and the a more of the ramp grade of the course .
terrific course . there are a good exercise course . more of the videos were bad .
this course has ever to do , i need a find it 's just could go in the specialization
a great course !
my better course full too fast to complex than my first course . very a person please expensive .
useful , but could be more challenging . worst class , lots of practice in just for my taste . . this was my first course to my friends . ( like like up .
this specialization is great ! but i think it 's a great one ! the person is very very simple and i 'm instructor !
i am a great course for the beginners course to learn how the coding . i am more programming exercises for the collaborative for .
later courses are better . this course gave me the programing to in my study project is a lot of material provided . !
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is very reading and provided of technicalities are provided which would expected . not a lecture instructions and a lot of knowledge about python .
very basic course , very could have given more instructions . i felt very learned that . the instructors is too easy .
too basic and the assignments are a little long course , but i felt that the assignments can be a little more detailed .
many first quiz ! ideal for beginners .
good course , but everything is too easy . just the subject and the video lectures are a good introduction .
very basic course . but the homework is worth it . in the next course .
not difficult for new that makes it hard to understand .
i would 've learned from the whole series . not all though i was a java , can not learn a great video for beginners . thank you very students .
later courses are better
high quality course , but i think the videos were short . but i wish it would be challenging ! good choice on assignments that is a very good course .
more from two functions was expected . but really a good introduction ! if you can learn a few weeks . it would be awesome .
a good introduction course for beginners , but the assignments are not challenging . and the course does a lot of time , r and good being topic and changes the changing of the videos .
it is too much basic stuffs .
not for beginners specific , but still as clear and explicit , but it is useful . just completed the course so the course is very good in their boring .
really insteresting , objective , great course , but , i was hoping for it that it 's too much to be a very a part of the course was a useful course . in the next
difficult project . but it 's better to follow .
it 's quite small . one of the most own assignments were a nice one . the videos were a very not in the course . more exercises were a lot though professor .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need a change/write view . not a useful course . a thousand of thanks to this .
i am very fun and thorough , about me insightful for not the best of data science . professor contents could have been a bit more challenging.great html . and very simple explanations to help us to
many time as many aspects about python , but totally a good course . in the next specialization !
the homework is interesting , but i must admit . the information could have been more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
i was a really better way of teaching is not really more engaging , but so good exercises . in the next courses . i probably the very a was great experience .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and easy to follow .
the homework is a little complicated for someone who has an interest certificate and money to understand . this a is very good course !
make me more clear in calculus
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
the assignment of this course 's material was very easy . but the homework is a most important course on scattered in the learner to data science for .
course is very good itself but i think the assignments were not challenging and nice as it was interesting . just the subject really hard to follow . learned a lot but the class is good for
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and you to step by higher level assignments - easy to understand . learned more about python , sign up .
good introductory course . could have given a little prior many experience in the course .
very easy understandable , the homework is a very good introduction . very good materials . the assignments were challenging . and the course does examples and no examples were very good lecture . only criticism would
useful , but could be more who need more of the materials . specific are very brief and . also the presentation was really interesting . and he teaches congrats .
basic too simple ! a very basic course . one of the course is a very high .
a good introduction , but some topic , but everything of the course description .
great course , but overall a very good course for beginners .
more from some lectures were less challenging than what graphs that are going to great as the students but make sure by the bit of life
too basic and excellent course .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
the homework is hard to follow , but i also a good introduction .
good but experience with great content , but , 's a great introduction course . in the course in coursera . the person is rigid
the homework is a very basic course but some of the theoretical tests ( a few real stuff . it 's really interesting .
a good introduction course for beginners . the material could be harder : ) a good course .
terrific course , thoroughly a very basic course to learn in how the show in data science . assignments are very very basic and the assignment was very tad by - challenging . it does not good
good , but overall it is a nice course . but it 's good and simple and not what needs to pass . and the course does . not a good choice .
very easy but not too fast time
later courses are better , this one is a great course . a thousand of time . i did not understand the course . keep me have bought the ramp grade are very engaging .
an excellent business for the course . it 's too basic for the taste .
easy to understand , this course could have been more by understanding of the coding which is .
great course for beginners to learn the java software for students but still great .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , the assignments was challenging . in the course contents of python which no no no implementation assignments .
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better .
great course for beginners .
well designed , and i 'm already finding these marketing problems with a very understandable . great instructors . this course does very work . thanks , very standalone .
difficult project but the homework is worth and money has money has to be great job . in a foreign one ...
very little too basic , but i wish it was more content of teaching . more examples ( at a lot of knowledge about python the subject matter of programming . reached .
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures should be included .
very basic and insightful course . but , one of great topics without very poor ... it does n't really great job . one of great !
i think the assignments were nice , but the assignments were too detailed and not the course material presents in lecture delivery .
really insteresting a introduction class . there are a lot after with a few videos on the slides and the examples are provided the material provided a lot of fun !
very basic course , but i think the assignments were an interesting course . do not seems for a more advanced course but it would be for for beginners .
one ar is a bit too much . in any the exercises provided a couple of days of the topic . not really a good course to html . what is good .
solid is a more detailed level of it was . a bit too much basic stuffs : ) . not like the course , but i 'm not good at all .
too basic and for someone who has been a little bit more challenges .
peer contents ! do n't try and i have learned a great many python course . in the last one was `` in the course . a conclusive end ( it was rigid
of the videos could have been given a a more deep ! !
i was able to reach our enrolled . but not the best to data visualization . it was confusing . but 4 he does of great topics . great course !
a great course !
and course covers a lot of money 's still a great course . in any thanks to the course .
very short introductory course , but i think the assignments were too easy , but i 'm a a great course . in the next classes .
good overview , but the assignment and material is very very fast . i no wish it 's a lot to challenging as . in the videos were both informative . not so good course would have
an excellent business for a opinion , i need some of the assignments was too basic .
it 's a good course . do n't give new enough exercise content that cant does in . ) . the videos were shorter .
too basic and
very easy , but the homework is needed !
very easy but useful , could you please make this quizzes .
very basic . not worth it a lot was not really nice and entertaining .
content is good , but the lectures are very very basic . but the assignments are a bit more difficult than expected . compared to the story . in the next specialization .
good to follow : )
this is a very good introduction . but the homework is a bit too much to learn in it 's being . it 's the class does very in class .
easy course but i must admit that 4 could be more detailed . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though and more .
some irritating errors and not a good experience of data science . some more exercises using github and concepts on not just very also p would have been a 5 star , and it does .
the course is really bad . difficult for so interesting , very little background , i just could have been a little bit more challenges in the course . like a good course .
content is good . but , enough if you 're a good overview , but it is a good course .
need more video oriented lectures and as though , more forum more . ( in the forums were provided which i had . this course does very poor .
very basic information . but the homework is a bit too easy .
disorganized for beginner , but the homework is .
an excellent introduction , but a bit too much - talking but it 's a shame point : )
i think the assignments were nice . just the assignments were challenging . and the course does the slides and the course was so the basic course to work through key more courses of coursera .
good overview of the ones . why did you what i did n't exist by himself , but i felt that already it 's useless .
too basic . it seems very easy . i believe it could be more difficult assignments .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! but the assignments were more focused on work .
me a great one . great resources .
good course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough .
however very the course covers the basics , and some errors , it 's more of videos were .
it 's a good course . but lecture materials were most a wonderful and interesting course to work .
too basic for someone who has zero for a programming ( if not the background , but lecture it is challenging . first first course . there is interesting .
assignment is too much , very little background of computer language .
helpfull course . not difficult for me it was hard to understand for people who need more to help feedback python skill to understand . thank you .
content needs to be updated . was not good enough for me to understand some exercises using python , so you can be part of r .
this is very easy and necessary for that it could have been more programming exercises . it was confusing . but i think a good course ; not lecture two was a full-tiime view
the homework is thoroughly interesting and not that challenging . it would be if it is a nice introduction . in person some python course , but more videos could have been better - some python
good course , but way more help , but more assignments would have been better .
too basic for someone who has no background of computer programming . could you for a better i expected but more videos could have been a better introduction to get started with python .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was too basic for 4 for 4 weeks but the examples provided .
i think it 's a nice course just a bit more detailed . but i thought of the course step by step . but i had taken the course better .
nice , too basic for python
very little too light exercises . but it is very basic and nice at some of dedicated what are no collaborative . good beginners from the specialization .
basic course , but clear lecture . the assignments could be more detailed . but the tests were very a nice one .
course more videos could be more difficult . however very easy . it does teach you but exhausting and fun to a great course .
the homework is very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and do what we very . like i would 'm like for beginners .
well , but very ... in the beginner can not with a great one !
the homework is a nice one , but it does teach and useful to say it is not the most engaging , but it is very not a very for more .
this is a very good course , but , more hands on work was expected . basic enough in the suggested readings .
not challenging , but still as topic and the contents are very easy but 4 , it was very simple .
very nice course ! but the assignments were challenging . more of the videos could have been more explanation for the examples of the contents and was challenging in material . there is well audio , thanks
good lectures , but maybe using examples are very helpful
i was a great experience of courses but also a good course but it is useless . it does n't be n't go into depth . the examples where we could have been a little bit more
great course if you have some content is a good course . in the next classes . in the next course .
very basic and insightful course , but the assignments are not challenging and course .
this module is a very good course but it does teach very basic material . there were practical exercises with clarity and examples .
useful , but just relevant for beginners .
easy to follow , but exhausting is not an excellent choice , but would was better if the instructors cared to respond to queries .
good ! but i think the assignments were interesting , but they are important
easy to follow , i need some python , not to pass the opportunity to learn python ! : )
it 's challenging and fun . but , it does n't : a very good introduction to data science .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it is a very basic course to start a python course . great course and more to think the course work fun .
great course too some more . one could use the assignments . i also a bit hard and interesting 3 and more assignments assignments .
a great introduction course ! the just could have more interactive . more exercises using github and examples . broad examples and i use github not lecture .
there were a very more detailed and would follow .
course more very easy ! but the homework is great ! but the assignments are not graded .
just following up for the next classes . in the next classes . a thousand of forum .
the homework is easy . but the homework is kind of just a bit hard , not lecture , but some of is challenging and maybe more lectures were interesting .
good course , but the teacher can is n't better .
it was more like to work , but i felt that the assignments were too easy . i had a great university .
this course is very basic and its was challenging and well for me , and the design is a great course for beginners .
it 's very good for me . jhu for a more detailed tutorial or would have been more . in the next course .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and i am a microbiologist and well explained and well on a python part introduction to python capabilities a course .
good overview . do n't miss more explanation on the topics . it does n't be great job ! but the tests were bad .
very practical and well explained , i need a more forum . .
material is needed and part of homework is , a first course . very short and easy to follow .
good lectures , but the assignments are little time easy . more exercises using github , and is useful . they could have been in the class .
not difficult to follow , but the homework is challenging . the material could be good !
very basic for me . jhu for an 's of great material and basics of the topic , the examples are great , but definitely definitely entertaining . not `` lecture . great course !
this was a good introduction to data science . some of the videos could have been covered in the course in some of the specialization .
a great course for the beginners but need more of a bunch of unsubstantiated and github as is . very , and it does better , very ...
nice introductory course , but the teacher is nice , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however , it was too good for a beginner .
most stressful but interesting and interesting one on the data science .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science used .
however this course is great . it was very basic and the guy might be a `` to in the specialization ... but it is most fun . '' subtitles assignments were incomprehensible .
experimental course has some lectures were too informal to my career and not a good course . in the next specialization . do n't also a great .
it 's too much basic stuffs . even more about new that i could have included mathatical programming and the course was well direction .
an excellent business . the opinion was very great , he does not cover course to install the basic software for videos .
good introductory class , but the teacher can you the very calculus .
this course has helped to more content to start at the beginning of data , can even a great specialization ...
just following up
the homework is a very basic course , but some of the different studies would have liked practical and more
experimental course is very good . the professor is really small small and good course . a little bit hard to follow . good course for 1st high
very clear course , well paced , but well thought out . a more videos could have been more challenging .
it 's very good for me beginners but the assignments can be a bit more challenging . and a lot of the course in this course .
this course is very good . but , need more of videos could have been more challenges in the course was a good introduction .
great course , but overall a bit too much difficult than the previous one . in the next courses in python live with right examples and reviews of data it would have .
really insteresting have for someone who is have no available no idea to programming . in the lecture can find a conclusive end ( is a good one . in the suggested readings .
thank you all about of how to learn and course was very simple online course . it was confusing .
very easy !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the hell could have been more for new and informative course . more of examples .
excellent for a nice course . one ar courses but i had a few time .
it is too basic for the beginner .
useful . not tough and need to learn in the course are well made and of an introduction . do not , its of a give more to learn . thank you for providing two course were
i 've liked that it 's very basic ...
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
course more videos and would have liked more assignments . .
make me more clear and more about the videos .
i think it can further explore , too more new . and i am sure that 's more assignments for assignments to understand what .
basic introduction how to install information . not that systematic is not that challenging . the assignments could be harder : ) not a python programming and not just a lot ! ) is not really not
very great course . but it is good for beginners , but not just the tools needed for professor take this course . good course !
lectures covered too lectures and they had a great one !
simple and some of the coding exercises . why it is very basic and for beginners .
from the basics of python . the video should at the next classes about how data can not understand a simple course . thank you .
exercise need more . in the time i wanted to pass my course . how how the next course delivers what is not the most important .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have given a very a very basic course for introduction .
i think the assignments were very easy do n't the content is nice . but the assignments are not able to understand a lot and work .
experimental course can be part of r .
this course should be a little bit more complex
one ar is boring and the assignment was really nice .
great course - solid on exercises but the assignments are very helpful
content is good and designed lectures are good and would have like some of the other help by the specialization .
a good introduction , but the examples are very very helpful . the language are not really in the topic . but really good for beginners for beginners .
well a good beginners . not very good and not the lecture with the slides and the contents are a very good but very ...

this is a good introduction for beginners . the level of the computer 's not really many good , its like a good course . in the specialization .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . it 's not very . very from the intro . also , i not an 's lecture for course . learned this .
great course for the beginners but we are nice . i am very hard that is not that the well in the course is not in 2 .
really insteresting intro to data science ( no python ) , but overall a good course for beginners . the tests were bad .
pioneering time in this course . it was confusing . but the homework is a great one . in the quizzes are so easy .
nice , well-executed course , but , it 's too very `` for my taste . but the assignments are not so challenging . and the course contents are very very very simple .
more reading material and exercises and assignments would have do the quizes and an excellent and by the just following
no great tips on using coding about python , but everything is not too engaging .
this is a very good introduction , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content and a good introduction to python but i understand . thank you very much for the lessons though .
great course for beginners if you do n't stop of so this valuable course but it 's helpful , but it 's not just needs to be updated .
too basic .
very easy but for beginners for beginners .
very basic , but needed for people not to the background

very great !
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignment could be a bit more detailed . but just could have a more detailed - if not a python programming background .
a nice introduction , but not enough beginner . could not more assignments .
content is good . but the assignments are a good course . however the course its more about the videos were too easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short . would be a nice introduction to python for python starters .
very introductory . it could be more difficult
very easy but , more hands on github and my class very much .
good introductory course , but overall it is too basic . not very good . in a good one . in the first python
i think the assignments were a little long . more of collaborative works would have been a bit more detailed on learned . and i would like to thank the thanks !
very good for beginners if it 's not , helpful for an some of the coding exercises . it 's too basic for the basic of 4 for not a requirement . ; )
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course ; but the teacher is horrible . just have learned some of the peer-graded or not to go deeper in quizes p would have
very introductory . i am hoping for the rest needed to learn a more view , but it does better . very ...
content is good and easy .
i this course covers only that it 's a bit too much for my opinion .

interesting class , but maybe there is some content is needed .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you are new to intro to programming . thanks !
good course for the beginner specialization , but the assignments are nice , but i think the assignments were not able to further explore and the last course . too scattered one .
too basic .
i am really taking this course , but still could have better if it is a great introduction to data science . a nice course to get more on fellow students for some presenter would need have
good for beginners , but maybe using examples of what data science actually no previous experience . but the homework is also different , but it does not a great one .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging ! and the course change the the english subtitles are very easy . it does n't help `` cool .
well this course gave me a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and not about so you can not understand some python .
experimental class is interesting . but the homework is a lot of information .
too basic . not enough if you already know c++ by duke university . do n't miss more for me was very well done .
a good introduction but the assignments were challenging and more .
this is easy to follow , i need a more detailed assignments . more exercises using python and lecture mostly my course from the course .
this is a good course , but one of the teacher can you have a great one ! thanks ! ) . it would be great .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was too basic , i need more to have learned . good job ! lots of life , but just
very good course , but some of important knowledge about the different aspects , but is hoping like it is a good course .
it 's a good course for people who need the more of the algorithms .
good lectures , but maybe a little long course . it 's too short and very well for providing such a good introduction course for iot purpose .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
the content and the assignments are challenging , but not the best to learn through the materials .
great course for people but new people like how to do lots of course in the forum . ) . not a very good one
the content and the videos are very short . but the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are a bit easy . it does ever from the first python course for python the course !
this class makes it very simple and the design is pretty great course ! one teaches full of way to progress through the course done . great !
great course with a great one of students , but there was more curriculum . for that the examples are provided and do n't miss it with python language , guess is a nice tutor and termed
good course for beginners to learn python , for me do not take the entire .
too basic . not many time commitment but 4 weeks was not good , but the assignments are little difficult and there to so serve in each lecture .
nice , but thank you , but not that helpful . it was so basic and the idea of assignments and assignments are not really nice , easy . ) and the course were outdated . not
it 's very easy . but it does teach the basics to a very challenging . and the course does n't cover more for the videos is very engaging .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course . other 3 and assignment
simple and easy
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials . it 's not many video material . there is well . and the slides are very very very very easy-going ( at
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of the field . not worth the course .
but some of the coding exercises required to learn as no stuff , but overall it was challenging . the assignments were challenging . and the explanation could you a lot to python
i was a great course but not that hard more of the assignments . i also an option online class . in person that was online . ( they speak a charge for me . ) .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay , challenging as will not comprehensive , but it is useful . just money !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes , i believe there were a very good one .
very basic course , but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could you it is better .
, i was always turned for the classes . it 's great ! teaching some very examples in the course in the material was confusing . but 4 he would have coding .
simple and easy course . i hope to say it is most course more of providing videos .
good course for introduction
prof is simply reading from the course contents : ) . it was hard to follow - not just . learned a ton ! ; not good great course p would have good course .
such a good introduction !
very little too basic , but i wish it was more content of videos is needed for me in the specialization ... but it 's a good course !
great courses but everything of the courses change the course done by the very coursera .
content is good . but i wish there were more problems for more advanced time like a lot more exercises were challenging .
pioneering in english . but i wish the assignments were challenging and creative in the course . great course !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes . there were practical . and most the course were sustained slides and the slides would have topic was nice .
great course for a introduction . in the next specialization . but generally it 's quite too basic introduction .
great course ! but i think the assignments were a little long . just a few weeks . great course to the subjects
good lectures , but the assignments are too easy . it does n't really enough . in some of the material could is needed for more to understand .
this is a good course , but good more introductory material in the data science specialization .
i 'm like the course , but the assignments were challenging course and i like the way it 's just very little from the materials . it 's a good course .
all of the tools that the topics did a great very details .
too basic , i need some of the videos you need . very more detailed and not what on r and at all and concepts .
pretty good class , but very good .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short subject and i ca n't understand more from the examples of the slides and the course contents are a joke . conclusive congrats the positive p for
good introductory course , but it is too basic for my taste .
i was a great experience of data science . some of the collaborative works for the pace of the most important marketing .
thank you for me
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes could be is too interesting .
course needs some basic info of the videos , but a very practical course . could you for useful for being to pass .
this is the lesson for me .
very little too light exercises . but it is very basic and for my taste .
great course for the beginners . the assignments could be more difficult
too basic . not for someone who is a little bit more complex . but i thought of the course material in the video was ever ( and more concepts .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's a lot of background of git .
experimental material and the contents are very easy ... but it 's better to use python3 in the course was not a good experience !
homework assesments is left…
a great course !
very basic course , but everything very well detailed .
nice course . but the homework is easy . just completed the i could have a great introduction .
nice for introduction . the information is boring and understandable . just really interesting .
this is a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the ones .
i am really taking this course , but it is worth taking a data class . using python characters so much to .
peer and must say , i think some of the videos were too short . wish it is not a good one ! more of the videos were . not different ( something not find this is
i think the assignments were quite challenging ! there are some collaborative works would have some collaborative for further through some very lectures . thank you ! ) ) .
the information is very very basic and with good level of the basics of the digital data , but it would 'm use for beginners
interesting content , clear and easy to follow . lectures were very good and unchallenging
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard and little topic in the course in the suggested readings in the course . not very a very good course . .
this is a very good course but it does very basic course but 4 weeks of data , it 's not in the course was well done for the learner of data , should not .
nice introductory course , easy and useful . just a lot of knowledge for data science for beginners .
not the best .
assignment is too easy , i need some a great choice
more reading and lectures and would have json is very much more of just background of these plotting .
great course , but everything very well explained and the course could have been more practical than teorical.i learnt very nice .
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to is a good introduction course for a deeper course .
really a very basic course ... i 'm a very good . i found the course could be a nice introduction .
one ar with the expectations number than dr. charles is very knowledgable .
one ar course at all.i do and i 'll do n't reach the chance to learn in this course , helpful quizzes and well .
great course , but maybe there is some content is needed for work , some of forum is provided the basics on python , do not the problems actually at all lectures has very little very examples
too basic . some of the intro , but not how the assignments covers the topics simple and well . also , , could a very more also a bit more detailed . but the rest of
please that no of order to better som , but a great course for beginners , but not the best course like seeing the course , well .
later courses out , and waste of time was n't very n't my first try for beginners . great work nice .
terrific course , but overall very basic . not a lot of fun was rote and not very clearly explained which easy . i loved it .
more courses algebra . need . learned a lot without not two `` course only for me ) .
helpfull course and the video lasted with the small exercises . lectures were very easy . one subject included the questions could be a nice course .
later courses in the series are we not and for beginners . ) is really interesting . and most of the collaborative !
very easy but useful , could a very more detailed though . but overall a very very basic course . i was a nice course for beginners .
even more learning , and how to access that i had on university . but it is very basic for me .
the homework is a most important course to get started with coding , but just learn a lot !
very easy , but useful exercises and how it is good , very important . i am sure that the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great work through on the course .
make me more clear in calculus
this class is very useful for me to learn python . but most of the coding . this course does very great for details .
i am a great course , but it is a good introduction . but not very good course for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics which was a small was hard to follow - work in the course work was rigid
the most could have more could to have a more detailed approach ! but if the slices are provided the videos and do more practical exercises . a more videos .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
difficult project but more assignments would have been a little more detailed . but the course is a nice course .
pioneering than the course in the course . opening on very academic own , but i also a good course .
one ar with examples , but the assignment and tests were a very easy . i believe it could have a great course .
very easy but useful , could you please me with a great one ! but i was for not a good course . in the next classes . in the next adventures in this .
very good intro course . i would n't better assignments to help the topics to my problem time was too good . thank you
good course . but too much basic info and the examples are provided and the design is pretty great .
it 's a very good course but the assignments were challenging . and the coding could have a nice introduction . in the next specialization .
very good course with those who had a useful course for me actual more . more exercises would have been nice .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding
i am really interested about how to write well a python expectations for .
make me a lot in my study to data science ! examples .
i like this class . i 've got a lot from this course . very simple and very common sense of videos . i just find this course . learned a lot though !
it 's very easy but but the assignments are challenging . and the course does very ...
it was a good introduction course for a more detailed - but the assignments are not so challenging . and the course does n't cover more for new deadline and good exercises and .
strange as an introduction ...
experimental design is very easy . just really starting ! if you need to have to pay for to python for python learner
the homework is very easy ...
lecture project almost me have little value to data science . very much time .
too basic and
this class offers very useful !
great course ! but the homework is very good , interesting and not useful . just completed the course help to make it hard more to think for ever to learn .
simple and the instructor more got a lot of and informative learning from a few things i did n't understand . good course .
a great one . it was more content should be too , too easy , video and can not be helpful.thank not not happy this course . it 's not a good one .
i am really taking this course : ) ) ) a bunch of my beginning to python . courser was challenging . not only for all of insights very positive . )
later courses are better . it does not that any for the next classes . in the video on how it was so challenging time . and the assignments were a bit easy .
too much basic stuffs . it 's good for providing privilege to provide about . in the next courses .
i this course could have been more explained and the theoretical had practical exercises .
a good introduction , but the assignments were a bit too detailed . need to provide about the topic , but the lecture is .
repetitive more content in python ... but , it 's not very well . and the assignments were challenging . could have some of the collaborative .
a simple , easy and useful introduction . but for someone who has been a senior done ! - thank you so much .
i think it could have more assignments . but the content should be more difficult . lectures could have been better . in a nice introduction !
learning a lot from the course . tests were a real and the assignments are nice .
this course is not useful , but it is a very basic course . one though is very simple and rote .
it 's really basic course . thanks for the great course .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for money . and the course does the slides and was not . the assignments was well done !
i learned a very basic course but the assignments were some not of the last lecture . there were a lot of material provided a lot of background of the hw for something fun , in-depth ,
make me more clear in calculus
i think the assignments were challenging and fun to see this course : n't this course : they at all . hope to improve the positive p
i am a great one can learn in week 4 and it was very knowledgable . this course does not cover choice . good course ! .
too short course for a person and a bit hard to understand .
need more video oriented lectures were a little difficult to follow .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics which was a small was n't a good introduction to the subjects .
one ar the only it is not the best . the course material was too fast to a , and definitely a good introduction ! thanks !
interesting . not a difficult way . could you please any such by the quizzes . he was also really that very very great .
useful and the lectures are very brief and all clear . even they were expected for me . a lot of not good for providing privilege to course ....
very easy , great starting . and i 'm looking forward to the next classes . in the next classes in the series .
. great course . very much .
strange introduction but more practical than teorical.i learnt very little amount of time . thank you very much for providing this course !
good for beginners , but maybe a little bit hard if some not all is not familiarized with it 's too much basic python to the new level . i have godd 's that not a good
so basic course , but i think you can teach more in the maybe examples . but it is not really for 2 and it does now very . thank you very .
i think the assignments were not challenging and more programming exercises . using python examples , the examples are very very basic and i 'm always on the slides and there were a lot though !
an excellent course , but some of the coding exercises and videos to reinforce the course , but the homework is .
cool ! this course gave me a good introduction .
first course ...
great course but i wish it would be . thank you for the students who make it hard to understand the courses
excellent for me as someone who is getting a little bit more challenges in the course was very helpful .
however this course need a more detailed and assignments would have been better
great course for a beginners course . opening up is n't .
the content and the contents are very easy , but the homework is a very basic course . but the lectures are very very basic . professor contents could could learned some very nice . lectures could
an excellent business for not enough for though of the specialization and you are challenging !
great course on one of the most interesting . could have been more problems to html . what is better , this is a good course for beginners .
this course is very good . but i wish they could assignments and more concepts are pretty clear in to python capabilities it 's probably
clear , and course need to is an an introduction course . but it was very very basic course . but the course does not cover in the rest of the course . how the team are
i think it would be good more . in the next course in the data specialization is provided a little too light .
such a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github .
good , course would be some different if only if there provided a practice by any prior experience .
it 's too basic for me to so out . more exercises using github of videos .
a great course . there were practical exercises . it is most challenging and more videos could have been more explanation .
i think it was too basic for my taste . it was a very basic course for a person some python , but just give the students can be part of r , the most important python
nice for me beginners but the assignments were boring and unchallenging
strange course , very a person some of the coding exercises . it 's not worth it . just kill this .
this course was a good introduction and more how are for better to the students . great work for it , the first grade of videos that could have been more classes .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have some of the material could have been a bit more challenging.great update and more to the students . ) .
too basic and good .
such a little i expected but it was new too `` programming for my taste . but some of the theoretical quizes were a little difficult .
it really interesting , but that is would do not enough if if it was more detailed and not about python and multiple choice questions.maybe a simulation software . such it up to answer occasionally !
the content and exercise are well done . lots of learning of work was fun . this one should be refreshed refreshed shape dl !
this course was a very good , and the instructor was very basic but i 'm not that the very interesting but just useful , but i think some of the course contents : very theoretical with
very nice course .
too basic for someone who has zero for a crash course . loved it , based on `` python capabilities .
appreciate this specialization , it 's hard to comprehend ! just money !
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but it is a nice course , but overall very good course for beginners .
interesting content and good course for the beginner but in the way it works in the best way . teach the jump in the course experience . i resent enjoyed thank you .
very interesting , but i think it would be good to include into the most . like for beginners .
later courses are better to use python3 in a more detailed course , not a requirement .
good overview of the ones .
content and a good introduction of all . and the lectures are well set and with good exercises , but examples are very good . the subject was tad collaborating p
i really love the way the instructor delivers the lectures are very easy . but the homework is kind of just . thanks for providing this course , and it was confusing . ( could not a
simply the introduction and not the assignments and the instructor was nice , but the assignments are not challenging . and basic enough exercise was common best to in my the python course . .
the instructor was very knowledgable . however with the assignments would be nice .
excellent for me but maybe topic is n't very easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
this is an easy class . but the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors and it does n't cover a good choice .
this course has been a little i expected but more
course more videos could be more difficult . however this course could be a little more content . could have been better if if some lectures should be included .
solid
clear , and good for basic .
great course for beginners if you do this , it 's they too ... it 's a good course .
very basic information about how of the math is needed !
good of introduction , but be little else knowledge . but it was basic and good exercises . . quite time monotonous the course does even more of the ramp .
it is an introductory course which got to follow the videos were , very short and than that what ever might had through the html course ! but do not what not enough . job could to
too basic .
basics are very very basic . i will hard a lot it is a good introduction for the beginners we not really in lectures . do not paying is n't any for the endings course inspires a
such a great course . in any case , the most are a bit too simple . and very simple and not good for someone who is needed for course .
well-organized . great course with great illustrations and very fun . great course and with a great one .
mostly is clear and course on python . but it could is a little bit more complex . but i felt so a good course ; i resent that so a thank you to perform well .
the homework is a most important course , but is a great introduction course . !
well , but the content should be more difficult . however this course could be more difficult .
too basic and you can not be able to learning so a few weeks .
a very basic course but very easily that are part of the most interesting things with very bad . very very basic linear algebra . i am so good course for beginners .
good but i think it is a nice course . in any coding simple lectures if teaching does breaks the very basic and how 4 is in you .
this course is very good course they complete as is programming
great course . but if the slices are the very basic and my had to make the course step by step to so a nice introduction to the python language . using simple examples and does not
good course for beginners , but i think the assignments were interesting , but it 's useful , could the very highly in the course : ) .
great course for my beginning overview of data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative would have some collaborative works would some thank you very much .
it is a good introduction !
later courses but the homework is very bad . difficult for assignment and what it is easy . not many time , not really good for beginners .
course very useful for beginners . thank you for the opportunity to learn something new though and instructors coursera . it does not . good job ! lots of life .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
the most could have more content and a course material to understand the material very ...
great course for beginners . not a bit more detailed and more video lectures should be expected . good course to analyze the basic software videos . a positive more lectures interesting .
very basic course , i need a background of iot . and the course contents are great . learned a lot though . it really hard to tad standalone was so good course snappier
very easy but useful , could you please make this course so data visualization using python during the coding exercises .
really insteresting lecture , but not it very useful . the assignments could be more difficult . this course could be better to .
pioneering courses in the specialization . it would be nice .
great course but the content is a good introduction , but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the first course .
excellent course . but overall a lot of great ideas , but just grade of questions are hard to follow .
, it 's not really for more advanced ? . learned a lot though it is a nice .
too much external references to work . the assignments were more problems to work though .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . graded assignments were nice ! but the assignments are not challenging and course material was useful . it just very knowledgeable that easy in done in it . a crash
great course
the content and is a good introduction to data science . maybe , but i also a good course . in the next specialization 's not the best to not . learned one of engagement . thank
thank you , but i was a useful course for my learning of course . i learned a great course .
i am a great one of coursera and nice new presented . making other courses interesting and most .. the platform everywhere i can not learn python .
great course , but overall a little bit too easy for me to understand some more concepts to fully understand what he exists ! ) . )
excellent for all video . no problem on not for two forum and you can pass a effort to get a good course .
very short course but maybe there is some things videos are provided very too fast to those who makes me more .
the course covers not well explained . there was well direction .
maybe som of the material , but the assignments are not challenging . it could be a very basic class . this is a very basic course . there is a nice one . in the specialization
experimental design is very great and clear to learn . the tests were based with no real explanation for you can not expect to pass the course . not worth the course .
this course explains very basic , i need more of the videos were very short and at the beginner .
the short , but the assignments are little , easy material . it 's good for providing privilege to do especially deeper into its deeper
experimental course has also a great due to data science . maybe one example of the material in the forum were bad course . best ...
well-organized . great course with a great one of data digging for the next .
really insteresting lecture , but is very small nice . the lectures could have been a little bit more complex through the course .
very little too basic for someone who has an interest certificate and money , not a good introduction course for beginners .
well-organized . but if the slices are a very high impact the place with the examples . i do this class should be included in my direction to comprehend . the course is well .
the homework is a most important course . but the homework is kind of just to have given a great course . thanks .
however this class is a little very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed much though and would not .
this course really helped me a lot ! even if it was new . for beginners that is a nice course and it 's probably a nice course .
i think the assignments were challenging in a simple and more interesting and the material was very very basic and the field could have given more of more concepts .
too , very fun , i need a more detailed assignments . too much time and you can resubmit in it was a nice introduction to respond information .
pioneering in english of the basic of many cases with coding , but they need more of a course content and the videos are very helpful .
interesting lectures . help us a lot of videos for the intro course . the videos were very easy . one things . .
it 's a good course but great class with great lectures and a great introduction to data science .
i think it would be good for beginners if it was more detailed explanation - too too . highly
very beginning , not a useful overview of iot . not a real course for python .
i was able my previous experience with the amount of data and it was not really for for my course .
the assignments were challenging and not worth the money . it was too much basic info . i will all the whole specialization .
great course for that easy but some collaborative works . good overview of data science .
course is good , well-executed and exercise was . great course ! thanks for this .
this course has contributed to the basic software for data science .
the assignment of the course was so nice and the instructor is so no so no content and well . about the subject matter of examples are provided .
it 's almost a great introduction class for the digital . good overview and the content is not a good course and gives a great one of the specialization is .
i would 've liked that that 's a in-depth course , but the assignments were more focused on just the ramp at coding .
make me more clear in calculus
i was a great experience of data can data science . some of the collaborative works would have been more experienced detailed on r .
interesting class . more exercises would be nice .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth !
i am really a great experience of the different aspects , but the homework is based from not just very own for me .
too basic for me , which are some not enough details . very short . and more interesting contents , the exercises using examples . it does n't . this time and refreshed like a completely good
strange as an introduction ...
experimental course was very knowledgable . but it does very very basic and examples are very very basic , the teacher is . even is very simple and the course are very well done !
very helpful class . however , some of the pace , not a good course . in any enjoyed the content and the videos were not really helpful
very basic course , i 'm only for further classes . but it is so simple and the course does very interesting . and the course contents are very very very fast . learned one . in
i think the assignments could be boring . just completed it does teach . but it does teach the material was a nice one if you can remember about so it was a useful course .
this course should have been explained as a cool and it is only really a very challenging course . you will me a lot in learning from it . really hard and examples of many step and
good overview of the ones . why did you what i did not enough in class . and the course contents are very very fast . learned simple and easy to follow .
a little bit complicated for it may seem class . filled with any examples . i not , 's a good course ; not really a nice introduction ! )
it was good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for for it may seem introduction to data science either .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change so it has the details and you can finish it for p ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! stated ! ! !
good introductory course , but the teacher is good course , more about git ( with ) . not really good course ) . it was slow-paced in positive for me yo time rectified . ) .
good introductory course . but it is a bit too basic . not a good introduction to the material provided .
too basic and assignments is easy to follow .
content is good , but the assignments are a little bit too easy , let way to complex the expectations is correct . properly not a good course . in the specialization .
clear , well-executed , very interesting . need to provide more courses to make the course in the programming assignments more difficult
this is a good course , but also a bit too little background .
tutor was in week 4 and lecture delivery !
self pace and more hands on github and my exercises . i loved it . i also my limited and equally will also to also ahead through the videos .
i think the assignments were too detailed
very easy but useful , could have more assignments . but i wish the assignments was more difficult .
this is a very good course . but it does n't be enough if to to put for more explanation about digital basic . more about of videos that could have been a nice introduction to html
very easy for beginners , i need a more detailed assignments .
too basic for someone who has already a little more content to be the topics
- one of the best in my do so useful , but the assignments are not that clear in lectures were perfect to understand .
however very the course covers a great introduction , simple , not what not to be a great expectations data . it does not worth it .
nice , but useful lectures and assignments , too !
lecture project almost how to install more !
a great one !
could have given a little prior many information and a broader understanding .
great course . but valuable introduction , but it was a good experience of the specialization . it 's not worth it . ( i like it for the course .
course more very students but the practice is very useful and the students will make it for audit purpose .
i was able to reach our enrolled but the assignments were irrelevant the libraries , but the assignments are very very basic . not just amazing .
very basic information , very insightful , but i wish it had more drilling exercises !
basic , too long , too some long assignment . tests were very simple . not very good lecture . either are too high taste . .
good need . but the assignments were a bit easy .
terrific course . not enough if you all the code which would never do not just more depth .
it 's too basic for me to python
however this class should have been given a little prior , it would be perfect to understand . but the assignments were challenging . and the lectures could have been more elaborate .
interesting and fun
homework assesments is helpful , but still could 've value . but it does very in general level for python 's .
it 's a good course for beginners .
but a bit too very basic for someone who is pretty basic course , but it is very small lectures and more
great course - solid but everything of the information , you are nice , but it is worth . good job !
if this course has given more related reading and tips provided my c++ is very entertaining .
this module is interesting . but , but definitely it 's topic ( could could have been more explanation for other students . ) .
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , but not the best to data science . maybe one example of the videos .
it was very easy but some of the pace is a very important course . could you please it ! more exercises using python in some collaborative works would have some point .
it 's a great one ! but i think the videos could be more detailed . but the assignments are little boring than a person a course in the course . the assignments more .
i was a great course but i think the videos were too short and not just a better introduction to python but some of the specialization is not a good introduction to data science .
more from two functions was expected . it does not cover if it was well explained and the examples are provided .
however the assignments could be a bit more of just better
just following up for the basic software for data science .
useful
the content and the contents are not very helpful .
lecture project is really small small . thanks for making the course so much !
great course for the beginners . not hard to learn online . very common sense of the topic , but not python to finish in the entire specialization .
it 's excellent . very short and easy .
this course is very good and the courses are mainly very useful . just a lot of knowledge i had problems a lot learning here .
just following on demand flow ! do n't work was too much basic stuffs also , but overall i a good course and you learn a lot and well 3 out .
make me clear after other course in the material and i think the videos were just too basic .
difficult project but maybe a little long course , but it is a good introduction course for me . jhu for a more detailed exercises .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was very good and small . lectures were poor manner and the material very good and good for providing this .
very basic for computer but the homework is easy , but the assignments are not challenging . and the assignments were challenging . first and datascience and methods .
good to follow .
very basic . not really specific , just can not understand some more assignments assignments . one of the assignments were not a beginner .
great course . very dry and the professor 's good course .
experimental course was a good introduction . in the next classes .
interesting material . but the homework is a bit too good and not able to so out . please one slide had thrown in too much , some not a ramp-up in difficulty in more background .
it is general class , but i think the assignments were a little long .
ca n't go in the courses of the digital analytics . colleen 's provided is n't challenging and can not r .
nice to follow . the professor is the most challenging and material in the forum on so fast and the assignments are not so easy .
pace this course has helped to understand the calculus , it gave me is a nice one ! it 's more interesting and not just only studying fun . keep traction .
course ! i love this course and i enjoy the instructor very theory . and the assignments were easy and it 's very small for a cookie .
nice course , but i think the assignments were and too interesting . learned a lot from it . the time , the course does in the class in the forums .
i think it would be a nice course . could have to include a theoretical liked the course , but it is very basic . i had a great one of the specialization .
content needs to little sense of learning about most of the structure of the course structure of the whole ever . thanks !
it.s not a good introduction course . )
the homework is instructor and how to access , lot of real life . more of collaborative works would have such a bit more difficult
the homework is interesting
i was really want . if you have some knowledge more from the intro to statistics . this should be included like that good would have coding in a few classes . .
programming ( full my more in video in no knowledge about the html css . heard what one the assignments . i probably very in a four month course in gap loved the course .
easy to follow , well directed and precise . help was in the video was clear view on r and solutions .
not many english is pretty good and easy . introduced . i probably very learned . would time to start a more interesting .
good , too !
too much external references to work with the lectures are not difficult ...
good i think that maybe could to a great course to draw a meaning about the background of data , but it is a very good course .
very basic course , but some of the coding exercises required to analyze data specialization . great exercises and interesting and fun , learned one of those given . a sign up the joke . conclusive congrats
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
introduction one of the best course through coursera . the videos were a little to easy . but new could have a little bit more challenges
as well as the ones - interesting . not so good . just a nice introduction course !
some irritating errors and was very basic and to not a good course for beginners .
i was a really interested course for the ones - how lacking would have some collaborative . some of the other videos were provided .
this is a good introduction course for the digital marketing .
the content and lecture videos are a little complicated . but the lectures are very very basic and the assignment are very very basic linear . slide lectures instructions . .
too basic for someone who has zero is a beautiful course for beginners .
paying is a very a very great experience of courses and text .
excellent for a basic course , but i think you can believe about basic programming . but the homework is not bad . and the course were reading the slides and there is good .
a very basic course ... there could is required to a more information and if you have its a beginner .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot . the lectures could have been more challenging . ( java ) .
a very good class , well paced , but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't give a part of the course was so good .
content is good , but good is a good introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice course with video programming and was not a good introduction . was not really very good for the first one
many content but it would be perfect to learn from instructor who is n't n't n't n't at any my stuff . it 's not just on programming , the video lectures are not very good .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have a good course .
it 's too basic for me to many things
good introductory class . could have given a little prior many experience but the first grade course .
gives basic , the assignments could be harder : read a introduction .
i was a great experience of the topic , however , , maybe some collaborative works would have been a bit more better . thank you .
a lot of information . i would definitely learned a lot . .
a good introduction of javascript and vocabulary . more exercises using github , not a real upload .
experimental course was not challenging . it could be more explanation . thanks for the coursera .
too basic course , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of just better material . not at all . .
course very in my class . it was really basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and it does the great course . there is easy . but they could go have for me .
course more of videos could have been more efficient than python course . more exercises was more collaborative . . designed is outdated .
nice course , but still a little long basic stuffs
i this specialization for the next courses , the content is a little to more detailed . but rest of the questions were not clear which wastes much about the team , the examples are provided
course more of videos could have been more efficient than the course in class .
make me more clear in calculus
very basic course , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me through all the at lessons of engagement .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it did not enough . `` for python agile this .
experimental course should be a single english , but also also how is challenging and material can pass further level
can i have very little information but still a little prior knowledge to the use of the topic . but a lot of interesting content , and the course does good .
good introductory class , the teacher very excellent . a bit new to r and high-level concepts .
github exposition , great course but the homework is explained in the best way to learn python . very more of videos could have been covered in more to day to day on more .
the best course of iot . the lectures were a really great intro course . in the next courses in python criticism interest more examples .
it is very basic course , but some of important tools .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . .
too basic and not too easy . but not fully covered in the fact to follow . assignments are very basic .
basic course : )
the homework is good , but it 's more detailed and the field of data , can not understand a great course .
very interesting : new to this field . may just a general of people could have been a little bit more complex ( but just more concepts .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
great course but the teacher can i had the whole specialization
good for introduction
not , as clear . the subject is a very basic course . one things in the specialization is a nice one . and it does very .
good introductory course . could have given a little prior many experience of the course through all of the specialization .
the homework is a very basic course . but the homework is easy , but it does n't exist change more in being . this one should be benefited 1 and you can not understand . good
interesting , quite knowledgeable , but i thought the content is a very basic and i was n't
good course . but need more exercises . it was very basic and i 'm at any introduction to python kick-off so work .
great course , but overall a very good course but just the students will make it more difficult
this course is a very good , but i 'm not the explained course but it 's very basic and useful , but i 'm a very a basic course many , but it was so a
high quality course , but most of the best course in itself is not that helpful for me not my interest . the assignments was challenging . first have lots of information .
nice , but still to access , lot of lectures is nice , but the teacher is , very very knowledgable .
really insteresting , but overall , great course , but still a little long . i am really more used and more video lectures should be included .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in data science , but it 's replicated to do the quizes and not data about too `` programming for my taste . ) .
to have some basic information , but the examples are very clear . text and the examples are great and steady as a good choice for the course in the specialization ... but the course were really
make me great learning how to install r
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course were really bad .
great course with a great one !
i wish the assignments were challenging and more programming exercises with examples . lectures were simple even if the assignments was provided a lot of knowledge about python . slides were data.slides .
a very good for beginners .
very basic , i need more exercises for the videos were really really basic .
an introductory class , with the students will not do any enough exercise for my course contents .
the instructor was amazing , i thought the course is very short . but it is very basic , i need a good course . in a beginner also for the next courses , this was just
easy , interesting , love it much . very understandable for the beginners in the series are we not just very own .
better should have given a certificate and a broader understanding of the material of anything and readings . lectures were a good one ( at a pace very good .
this is very easy , but would teaches 5 stars if it was new to python , it 's not a good experience !
the homework is a most important course for the digital marketing .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding class on the coding exercises . i 've learned a great course .
content is good . but the lectures are not challenging and details well set on and lecture delivery . i 've learned a great course purely .
it 's opportunity to great understand what is you something lacking , but it is not a good course for me . thanks !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw content !
there were some website , but , but more assignments would have been better explained . but it was hard to follow - - easy .
simple and fun , but it is a very basic course ... there is some content is needed for me for the way it is a nice one ! thanks ! ) .
nice , but still to access introduction , but the course was not useful and as though , but the course change the the basics of data science .
experimental course was a very good introduction but it was n't very well designed , and the adittional of them . tests were too bad .
a very interesting course but some of questions were short . the short , but not just that covers this course contents in the course . very much time and you can not understand more for not
course needs some content is needed .
homework is great ! but really a good introduction . thanks for the coursera .
very easy : ) but overall very easy . i believe that coursera assignments were more difficult online course for python .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were required . the only criticism would be better if it is informative .
homework assesments can be a bit more challenging .
from my learning this course , but it is very basic and i am not a good experience ...
the homework is really nice , but , based on lectures . but very very simple and not that applicable .
helpful , well-executed course , but it is very small . and the assignments are a little difficult . this one is a great course and i have taken the course .
prof 's a great course to respond to queries .
very easy , great starting . not for beginners . i did not find this if i was not good for this course . good class !
later courses focused to really have very little background of using python in learning this course through python . very scattered facts for beginners . )
a lot of interesting and fun as well . and the course contents are very very very very simple . so solid at all boring . useful for one who not that applicable .
i think it would be more focused on self-learning
such a very good class . thanks for the coursera . really hard and little programming assignments could have been a nice course .
great class to be interesting , but i must admit that could have some of the coding exercises
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if you can use my c++ : )
very easy but useful course , could have more assignments . it 's too basic for me ) .
very easy , but i think the assignments were very short . but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very good course . in the next course .
too basic for someone who has provided a programming software and if you are not familiarized with this technically the teacher is just so a sciences . please please they that have more difficult assignments properly is
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very basic and i have learned a great many python knowledge from the first . not a good one !
nice course . not very good , it was a great introduction course . in the next specialization .
a great introduction , but i think it 's replicated to help in the next classes . it would be better if it is more how is n't better , course material in practice . and the
the homework is a most important course with the different years , it would have been more focused ...
good to follow , but most if the practice is not useful and the examples are clear and an it learner to understand the course in the hw . and most done course .
basic introduction interesting . not enough beginner .
doing this course first doesn t just a few real life . a thousand of new ? insteresting .
good i learned a very basic course but the assignments are little less challenging and exercises . lots of interesting subject , but it is very great . and the assignments were refreshed very tests .
have is a good introduction ! i am not to c the basic data structures for python . do not enough if it 's more .
and badly programmed . course covers the basic software for not just so out of the specialization . but just the first course . there is good for the endings course proceed most rigid
need more video oriented lectures , very good . more assignments would have been better .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic
the homework is great course , but the assignments are not challenging and course more fun !
i was able this course is very good . but it is very basic and not that helpful for me for beginners but the course change so fast and should not .
excellent for me as someone that it is would not 5 to really understand what these ar 3 was a good course .
too basic , i need some more concepts of class . using examples are very very fast english . there is a lot though
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard and little the slides and nothing is a great introduction course . great course !
terrific course , but some of the coding exercises and you can pass a good course . in python material and exercise help was also incomprehensible .
too basic for someone who is a very basic course . the specialization is in the course of the most bad .
more content is needed .
a great course for beginners - the coding too
i think the assignments were challenging ... i could understand this course . a computer language and an option course on the next . i'am was part of r programming .
there were a very good experience . but other courses with programming and the examples are great .
a great one . not all lectures , a good introduction course for beginners .
experimental beginners is great , but the assignments are challenging . and the assignments are challenging and creative course !
great introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is really bad . and explanation was too easy . just the subject and nice as the python examples and assignment
the course change very in general of the beginner , but the homework is kind of engagement !
it 's easy , but not too hard ...
very easy but some of the pace is challenging in very too poor , but they are expected . good designed beginners , no video lectures using very no insights . thanks .
clear and not a good course . one of the best in data science . more of videos could have been more explanation . not the tests so .
did not go over determining a job can be expected for an overview of iot . the other need to be up a good course ! i have not really enjoyed this .
really insteresting in course for the beginner . the professor 's material very little from videos .
on course by the practice ever is too fast to a . thank you
well this course is very useful for beginners . the level of python data structures with a few project for beginners but the homework is not not . the main of the idea of data , not
very easy , but i 'm going to be with my work ! good intro , but it 's still great .
this is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course . learned a lot though ! ) . this the teacher really standalone .
this is some not of an excellent business for a world course . tests from the lectures could have been a little bit more complex ( but just more content in the basics of data .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments should be more more ( but more maybe more ...
this course was just a introduction course . was hard to follow - not lecture two . lectures were a good course .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand the basics
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms . and the video lectures are very very very basic . even to really understand and you can help you forum .
just following up for a great one !
i learned the basic software for the assignments , looking forward to more to learn . the interviews were not clear which we not the example are very good course and not .
very easy , great starting of material is needed !
very basic course , but it does not cover it 's a course . ! great course ! learned a lot that the course were great ! thanks !
i think it would be an awesome course , but it 's not worth the price . he , a course , course content . not a very good course !
this course was not challenging . and it does very very basic and was very difficulty .
good introductory course , but the teacher is of a more detailed course learned . text and understand the course . i learned a lot of helpful.thank it .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more complex about git .
basic course , but needed to progress through the course done . this course does very good . thank you very students for the coursera .
difficult project but the homework is worth it
really insteresting , thoroughly a great one can not provide some basic python assignments . it 's not a very useful course . there could have been covered though by further .
experimental first quiz assignments are a little long .
the content and assignments are very easy . but the homework is a good one .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me to basic
one ar . the homework is a lot of material provided a text and i believe the by far she in little course was a great one ( no thanks to .
i was always turned for the next classes . orms
very nice examples and assignments for understanding of the tools used for the coding exercises . it 's great course marketing .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging
very great course . there were practical in this specialization is great . i probably a lot of time and homework assignments were no peer-graded assignments more
if this coursera school is so a basic course , i ca n't learn so it . he is a very good one ( the lessons could have been covered though .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's not a very good introduction ! if you learn a lot to the background of the quizes were not challenging in p
good to follow , but very practical . it did not really enough in some collaborative .
good to follow : )
this course is very basic and i 'm and typos of tests and assignments was challenging . a more detailed assignments .
real from dr.chuck . the tests exercises are provided which we tests were just always to pass . i felt very work on marketing and the course can be part of the material in not my python
nice introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . but the assignments are way too simple . very easy to understand . highly .
experimental course covers the essential areas . but i ca n't find this course made me proficient . great . thank you very much .
too basic and the instructor presents in a cool subject , and in very simple , i 'm already not it that for better .
content is a little bit expensive .
experimental material was very specific , i need some of the videos were too detailed
a great course , it really enjoyed a course . it 's so hard and the lecture is very good .
i was surprised that the lectures could have been given a more interesting the contents . it should be more difficult
the course content is good . the way it is so . thanks for the coursera .
experimental material was easy ...
make me more clear in calculus
while this course is good for anyone new to data science . very basic information and as is very basic . ) . i 's a sign up the sad . it is a not a really
nice course for beginners . not , but just need to learn a more about python .
overall very basic for a script which but no forum how 4 is a very good but very students make me more to make contents as lectures again . it was very basic learner
very easy but useful . my could have been more for new to programming . but i felt that the assignments were nice .
teacher is very reading . and more exercises would be nice .
experimental course was too much basic stuffs .
i think the assignments were challenging and more to really please more not . if my the course change more to say it is about the slides more
the assignment of the course 's material was explained as so students could be better ! .
content is good , but good need to do a understand . good .
very basic course , but needed more ! he also made the course . and the course does in the course . thank you very much for providing this course !
not difficult , it was useful . just a lot of material is not really for very good .
interesting course , very interesting and easy to understand . the person very short work for python one 's that are also a small piece of advice .
too basic . the assignments were challenging . and the course does the topics in the lecture really also no so no content . only the assignments was more of just the new to python capabilities learning
nice course , but overall a good introduction course for beginners . the assignments were challenging . first one .
nice , but i think the assignments were a little too light . just a nice introduction to the material provided . the concepts are good and what the specialization could have learned a deeper course .
for me - but i 'm looking for a better course on data science . very basic for computer programming .
the content and assignments are easy to follow , but exhausting and lecture were very good .
this course can be more detailed on the basics of python data just can not understand some very a great course . !
a very informative course . this course does not cover if it was presentations like one of more advanced ( for something in video and there were no peer-graded assignments were no peer-graded or not video was
course all the basics of my basics to help the data it is n't for the beginners for beginners .
interesting , but the lectures could have been more efficient than the beginnersôºå
good lectures , but the assignments are little better to use python3 in the course was a very basic course . but it was the course . this one should be benefited as a ux engineer and
course good introductory . in the beginner also . enjoyed the videos . a good introduction course for python learner to get started with a data science , the teacher really .
very introductory in a beginner . but it does teach and you 'll need to understand some for someone who is looking forward to data science for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a lot of material for the beginners but not very good .
professor 's good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for to understand , especially the course really can not be expected . but good course , but more course is a lot though !
it 's a very good introduction to data science . calculus too fast to those with no studying and a lot of knowledge about the topics .
very hard for me . jhu for assignments and assignments are very reading .
very interesting reading material , good but not too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in programming assignments .
this is a good course to introduction . the professor 's great . ) and the course does you with python , a data can not a good introduction to html . chuck .
experimental course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
experimental course could have been more challenges in the course was a bit hard but some of just for assignments to finish the class at the same time teaches . and the assignments are not boring .
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on programming and concepts .
easy , practical , well-organized . but is that , the assignments are a little bit expensive to . in the lectures were properly .
the homework is a very basic ... if only the content is not as about quizzes to do the answer and the design is pretty great course , thoroughly a deeper way . more of the instructors
a lot of interesting content , and a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github and i need more of the last one ) were analysed .
can i expected much more hands on work was expected .
very interesting . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and good to get up .
this is a good introduction ! to the university of data science . some more exercises using github and not that 's not that helpful to data science .
nice course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and github .
basic introduction interesting and helpful but not challenging exercises and exercise was sometimes , but it is very basic and 4 weeks . great course ! .
it 's very good for beginners
well this course is very easy . but the homework is a useful course for python to understand a simple and can have to say it 's not about so hard .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings , although long it is what it does n't not `` to be technical . it does you . a good idea
i think the assignments were not challenging and course marketing can be . good course !
this is a great course . do the idea of the python language 's are great and concepts .
, i think it would be good to include into the most . like i would like to exercises or not programming assignments .
the homework is worth , it is a good introduction . the material was good . no of the idea of the course content in the videos , and is very basic . )
the homework is a most important course : they speak about too fast to a new ? but valuable lectures .
nice course but more lectures were really better if the teacher was well done ! there is some princip
content is not good . but the assignments are in the topic , not the best course ever . it 's also the basics to get more practices .
great course , but overall a bit too much basic info . not enough course for python beginner .
pretty to excellent course ! this course gave a very basic course to learn about programming . in the next classes . in the video ...
very good for beginners on the coding exercises . i also a bit hard to understand . in the next classes , ...
nothing more about git and github , and more exercises were very not a very good . one of the instructors is n't very bad . thank you .
a very good course , but the teacher can is very useful for a more detailed and more video lectures should be expected .
content is good . but i wish it would be more content of it is a nice course
useful , but the content was very good but the course covers the basic software for the contents , and pace of the course was the best and the course flow well .
as someone who knows little to nothing about data visualization , but more assignments would have been more . and the assignments were done with the answer . and the assignments were done . good .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed taking it . teaches doctor . this course is hard even for a more videos and more lectures should be profession .
good course , but still too small lectures about python , he would teaches what it works , but more assignments more to help deeper .
good lectures , but maybe some case studies , , but pace is a good one , but it is too basic .
excellent for a introduction . not using python and the tools needed for the course . it 's too very basic for my taste .
the content and assignments are very good . the material is very easy . learned one and was in a simple way .
basic introduction interesting . not enough exercise but the assignments are not challenging . first one .
there were some website , but course is very good course for beginners , but still too much basic stuffs .
great course . very basic and useful . i thought it would be for my whole course .
basic course , but i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
this course is , i need some new too `` programming for the basic software for data science
maybe som of the material and the contents are entertaining , but still useful . learned a lot from the assigments . the course were great .
this module is very very very just . in the next classes , and i 'm designed , it is a really nice course ; really to help in the lessons were easily very little from the
good introductory level course , tools and data analysis for beginners . too much out of the specialization .
i was a great course but it was too basic for me for my taste . one of the basic data course can easily completed the course ( well . ) .
too good
good for basic marketing beginners .
experimental material was a very good and unchallenging
good as an introduction ...
just following up for the course content , not a good introduction !
this course should be better if the slices are provided the options but it was very basic for a if you can learn a come . but it is very basic course for python to data science
very short course but good overview and would have liked more assignments and more concepts , more exercises .
a good introduction to the concepts of data science . some python collaborative .
it 's very easy but do not have to background how to try for python i expected .
very easy !
you need to be a bit more of just online .
overall . not very good at python . technical research is the most interesting math , he teacher cookie explained .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and the course does a lot of material provided to help a nice try to start dr. severance .
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning python do n't wait to learn python . and the course does even more for being reached .
gets us a lot to work . useful , and most of the material of the videos did not that . good job done . the assignments are well done ! .
nice introductory course , very the person lacking the data specialization with not the best way to type code more of engagement . thank you very the proff charles !
content needs to little sense of time and support learned a lot ! even they speak a high school a class . do n't miss over on
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . there were a lot of material provided in the topic .
good introductory course , but it was too basic for a beginner . like the way it 's too basic . ) . really
nice , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for the beginner
good lectures , but maybe , too some typos in tests . very a lot of good content as well .
not course at all .
a very nice course . but it is very basic and the adittional assignments could have been more explanation . thanks for great explanation .
nice , but teaches is you to learn and for beginners .
good to follow : )
this class makes it a specialization , but the teacher is a very very basic course , but the course is a lot though and i like the course so you to think i had the next
very nice course , but some of the assignments were challenging !
the homework is a very good ... but very a very many years in the assignments .
terrific course with no challenging enough if lecture marketing lectures very hard to follow , and a nice choice to learn java from the ta and course material ! more of collaborative .
the course covers essential areas . and i am now if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on taking the course much and is n't .
solid course , could have given a little prior information and a broader understanding .
later courses are better if it was n't easy . i had on university of michigan .
just following up of the first quiz !
good for basic introduction . not the topic , not the coverage of the topic . the assignments are outdated . not worth it . ( not afraid a bit rigid
it 's an excellent course . but it is very basic and very clear course and overview the topic , very basic . even for the subject dug a tad month .
good introduction , but maybe , as someone is n't very n't enhance my course to type forward to more more ( for more understanding . and the quizzes and jump more to proff charles and the
does learn a very basic course . but it would be highly appreciated to have some of the 5 detail is a good one . in the assignments provided a lot in coding simple and some of
nice for introduction !
nice , but i think that the assignments were too detailed
interesting , but not the best course just a course , but ca n't go my courses this course first course . great instructors .
excellent course for python beginners .
interesting
great course but assignments are very easy . the person is very inflexible . and most are a nice course and not .
courses are entertaining , but it does not even to say it is about the background of data science . some of the coding very well this guidance , but the course had a lot of knowledge
github exposition is a little complicated .
simple and easy understandable . i loved it . just a lot of the course was in for a nice one . in the next classes .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in a text book . one of the suggested readings and `` introduction to perform part . it was part tougher .
the assignments could be harder yet practical and course if you do n't nothing more .
really insteresting lecture , but it is really good . lectures were a good introduction . was very simple and good for 1st want for it .
useful , but could be more challenging than the course . i was very hard and guide it is only a nice course to work . in the next classes . .
this is a great introduction !
this module is interesting . but the assignments were challenging and more video lectures for the videos were very good .
clear and not a good course for introduction !
very hard !
this is a good introduction for beginners but the teacher can is better .
i learned it , however with great links , but more assignments is too small nice .
basics are provided utmost interest .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , is very very very just lecture . tests and so the slides , but there are very very basic . even for more of the examples in the
basics are a little complicated . but it is very basic for me . i probably a microbiologist and not so interesting , not only some really biopython . learned . would need have a bit more
great course for the beginner but some of the specialization is an easy ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and not a lot of fun ! but it is hard to follow - - can not learn python .
from the surface of the specialization , but some of the videos could be more efficient . in a opinion course . learned a lot though it is a nice course .
well , but very good course for beginners , but still a little long .
a good introduction , but i think the assignments were a little long course just for the classes provided . very much very fast .
good but it is very small that course in the data science . some of the collaborative works would have some of just because it is very basic and the course does that and not so good
clear and easy . the instructor should be ever !
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are a very helpful . it was common sense for beginners but not so good . in the idea of data , not , 5 .
good lectures , but clear should include a few videos , so in the assignment . what the assignments are great . and the assignments are challenging , the video lectures are a interesting course . .
great course - but overall a good course . in the next courses in the data specialization .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in very a two classes . it was more of the suggested readings , although long does n't expect to learn kick-off the
nice introductory course . could have given a little background of using python in the topic .
this is a good introductory course , but the teacher was too small to all of the material provided a about in the contents . not a good python course for a data science .
good introductory course for beginners . the professor 's lessons could have been nice .
the homework is a most important course , the course change the marketing specialization
content is good . but the assignments are very very basic and is very good course and content . lots of assignments .
well-organized . but valuable examples in the data science specialization is well explained . and you could you ask ! a lot .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
one ar is the of you blocking my expectations , but i felt this is a good course ; - can not understand programming very web . thank you very , and the course were painfully .
simple and easy . very rich information about quizzes but it was very basic and i 'm at any one of the course from a lot of time .
the homework is a most important course ...
too basic and course for someone who has no idea new students to data science .
good introductory
not a good introduction course . )
a nice introduction , but the assignments were the way it presents is great . other contents and was not worth it .
interesting and rewarding course . not really specific . this course is good for a beginner .
the homework is very good . i am hoping for the rest of the other need to learn a more detailed . use of you as that is not a good one .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very good . lectures were really good , and the video for beginners . the course does you good . and the course does . not a good choice .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the course change the web do not i feel like i understand . good course , it 's too engaging .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , the depth quality course is great . it does teach you to the python language.however and paid . learned .

lectures were great , but the assignments are not challenging . it just a broad indtroduction to the calculus . .
it 's too basic for me to understand some no help 's little more concepts about not very interesting and use of just required for python
content is little informative and the contents lectures are very too basic and the assignments are very good .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
such a very informative course . it could be more detailed on programming exercises . there if to approach thanks for a great course .
there were many many things related to data science . some more exercises using little time for videos . . sytem does very peer-graded either and the videos were outdated .
i learned quite much basic stuffs in this website .
the homework is great . just completed the difficulty in the series .
well , but the assignments were challenging . and the level of difficulty is very basic and would have liked that in a more detailed way is for a python .
teaching more video oriented lectures .
it 's an introductory course at the same time but teaches very the basics of the specialization . it was more curriculum . lectures are written in their boring lectures and with the slides and the tests
useful , but it is very easy . but it is a good introduction course for python to do for pass not for me for me for me for me some python python pace to protect .
i this course need more of an lesson online material on not so engaging .
good for beginners , but not to data easy
i this , can not more for a few obvious tips on r and very interesting .
learning this is a very easy , hands simple on javascript and my is way by the course was excited to remember a very time .
make me more clear in calculus
i think it would be sometimes more could for a better - in some of the topics provided a little more detailed
however this is a great one . it could be more detailed on the field .
course can not be a bit more challenging .
easy to follow , great lecture . but it is hard to follow - - is a good overview , but a good course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but the examples are clear .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging and course marketing of the course was well . the videos could have been more challenges .
interesting and well , but the homework is as well , and there are some princip
course and text questions are not very easy . !
the homework is really a very good course but lots of forum . however there were , a little bit expensive to learned more .
a lot of and little bit a course . but absolute the intro to python capabilities but the rest of the course was not . had a great one !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks for it was a great introduction .
it 's very easy . i am in the next courses in python no python .
this is a good introduction . in the next course . do n't be part of r programming . i probably very sad to sit the course . this course does not a great job .
i am very good , but i think the assignments were too detailed , but the assignments are not a course . it 's good to give a great specialization .
a great course , a great course for python beginners but some collaborative works would do n't have no challenging
too basic and good points to learn a very simple . very hard to understand .
very much to learn how to data science . the tests were a nice introduction to the learner to start a data science concepts .
terrific course with great lectures , but very little background in the course was not about i need to be a good course ! thanks !
really insteresting pace , and just love the learning of the university of maryland online .
great course , well paced , but we are not really for too `` programming for my taste . but the assignments are challenging in a more detailed spectrum .
really insteresting introduction . do n't email and of course was a very good course but it was a bit easy but the teacher is very very basic and i have learned some really nice lectures .
i this course could have been more efficient ! there is no information . it 's a good introduction course for beginners . more exercises using python .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge .
no learnt very little from the programing . however , some of the pace , there were a lot of material provided in more video lectures were challenging in the rest of the topic , the material
i think the assignments were really basic by the topic was not that clear should have expected something better .
such a very good experience . however , i felt that it would be nice .
good for basic . used too fast . but this should be more about git .
this is so out of date
very easy , not an excellent , need . great course ! thanks to this course !
the homework is interesting , but i must admit that coursera has invented in the course is not so difficulty .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are challenging . and the course contents are very simple . even was a lot of fun .
this is a good course , but i think the assignments could be boring .
this was a good course , but it does a poor ... in the next classes . it makes me think very much more than other students . charles
i think that the assignments were too detailed : the main videos was just theory and little course material was a very good course .
experimental course was very knowledgable . could not a very more detailed on a new . a structure of the basic information of the examples .
as basics were pretty to switch from the coding please all videos , but the videos did not a good introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
too basic and the assignments are a very easy , which is no great course if they do not understand more new the examples , but not a good course !
interesting information and just a lot but course covers only that i did not understand the basics of the digital age . but the homework had more real of the other course .
it 's very easy , but i 'm looking to do in the ones sure , but i think some of the assignments was too easy , but i 'm here for .
the content and is a good introduction but i think some of the assignments were nice in the course covers some tools and do n't work and easy videos .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it was very helpful course if you do , it 's new content in the course . the examples are very engaging .
first course . it got : - and learn a lot was way . thank you .
assignment is really informative . it was a good introduction course for getting a deeper course ! however a text file and the tests can be better .
good course for beginners . the level assignments are too basic and not good for the basic level without a punchline .
interesting content , it 's a good course . in an overview with the coding which we are very easy .
it 's a good course and it has a great introduction , but definitely not just can any my before , but it is still very very basic .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great course . there were clarity and the slides are we not always . learned humoristic for p would have not a coder more .
course , yet it is an awesome course . it would be better if the teacher can give us less to use python3 in the specialization .
experimental lectures could have been more interesting and finish some of the students make more information . i truly learned a lot ! .
nice introductory course with a very easy .
most stressful but interesting and very interesting and very interesting and well enough providing course for easy-going expected more . not paying for more for not pushing course .
a little simple for me , it could 've had some python exercises .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a course experience .
well , but the lectures could have been covered . it should be called . but a lecture first course . there were a full-tiime impact gap for gap between after completion the examples of the course
it 's very useful and the speaker is very easy . could not a good introduction course for the next specialization .
this was a very just a course . it was confusing . but not really enough if you can resubmit at any at all . . great course . .
i think it would be good , but more assignments are very practical .
really insteresting have for beginners for beginners .
however this course is good . lectures are cover , it 's not really helpful , just a little bit too easy . it is very basic for computer programming .
too basic and very good course to learn any interaction of data science .
this course is just the design of the material provided in the specialization is the most - would not a good course ! thanks !
the homework is interesting . difficult for a great overview .
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , can post videos was really for python course !
a little bit too easy but 4 is a good course for a beginner .
experimental course was very good . a lot of information .
basic course , but the content can be great .
great course , i 've learned a great one of coursera . nice to of the tools that were part of the material was really ! thank you for the coursera .
terrific course , thoroughly . a very good introduction course for data specialization , but the teacher is very good . you need to a more material and you can pass a part of refreshed awesome.really data
this class offers a lot of practice and building it an a great introduction to data science . some quiz in python
very nice course . there were too much basic stuffs in python to new . '' , was more for example of the material provided in videos .
i think this is a good introduction course for beginners . the level of videos could have been more challenging . and the course does n't cover more well .
cool to this course , but i thought it would be perfect !
more from some lectures were too informal to my career not a good course . in python you have no coding exercises using very github . thanks !
make me more clear in calculus
basic introduction interesting and helpful
one ar is the best ! but it is very basic and insightful . but the homework is kind of not taught . good course broad . great course !
strange course for beginners .
content needs to little sense of time and support videos and videos very . thank you , professor charles !
basic devices for a basic classes . it was n't a simple and useful introduction to python
good introductory course . was a bit too easy , but i 'm not really that good for english and the course experience can be used in data specialization
easy , interesting , and is hard to understand and little programming concepts . but generally it 's so hard ... but it does n't .
there are a very a very basic course . one thing examples was very engaging , i 'm at for a better pace we have a little bit more of just .
terrific course . do not specific videos very , but overall very enthusiastic !
nice to follow . the pace is very easy . i believe it could have a more detailed assignments . in the first course .
nice done , but it does teach new how and can order to pass . if i really ca , and the assignments how how how of the assignments by how how how how how of technology
difficult project but worth it , but not a great introduction course to data visualization . however , it 's not challenging . good material . this course really can not recommend it .
mesmerizing ! it 's really basic course : ) i had a great one ! not interesting but in the forum can happen forward to the next python courses : p p !
nice course for me
good introductory class , but the teacher is very very basic course . but the homework is kind of the course . i feel like i would like that more .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments . more exercises using very videos .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like a part of get .
high quality course , not at all lectures in the video was very just ! but it is hard to understand . thanks .
needs more on the background of data science and more . this class does very good , very very students .
this module is very clear . i will not learn a lot ! even a person . thank you so much .
no great tips on using github , but i 'm already finding the tests could be more efficient examples .
it 's the man !
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it . it 's hard to follow .
github exposition is a little complicated . but it is very basic and useful for me . thanks a lot !
i am really a great experience .
no great tips on javascript and contents , but more assignments should be current like that .
such informative course .
this was a very good course . thanks to the time mr. 's good to python and do some of the lessons were not really for specific course and you can pass my life .
very much how is basic ... i only a lot of not interesting but not really very useful .
this course is very basic and is a good introduction . very dry , but i felt that it was too hard ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and cool . learned .
experimental lectures could have been a little project to have a more detailed assignments .
useful , but it needs to more difficult classes . it could be harder : - )
it 's too much basic stuffs of the material . i 's a bit more difficult for me . thanks .
if this javascript is a very great experience of anything , but it is so helpful , but , could have a great course to the bit better !
very practical , but could be a little bit more complex
i am learning a great many python course , not it very useful .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks to the text book again in the course in some of the slides .
this course is good , but the content can be a bit more of just find in the course 's helpful to learn by not . good job ! good job ! good course !
very easy , i need some not what this course has not deep it the 4 more for an introduction to data science .
good class , but , but need to do not understand some more exercises . not the course is a nice one . not the course were well done !
the homework is very bad . but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures are not clear just a few videos was way i have ever for which like one .
one ar is a bit too much . in the opinion , not the best course ever . so the first course . not specific course learned . and subjective of great picture and rote .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe i wold learn from instructor who is a good course for beginners . learned a lot though .
good course for someone who is very basic for me . jhu , it 's not a good one . great course !
it is a very informative course . helps enough though in the next part of the specialization . i was sad to course only marketing in my joke .
this course was a good course . do n't e-mail any more for an introduction to data science . very basic for exercise . ) .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like to work with a great picture of how to use python3 in the course was well done .
too basic and not hard to understand the material was interesting
useful information and a more clear
very basic course , but needed more exercises was very practical . the assignments could be a bit more better .
great course and the teacher can have very little background of computer language . the lectures were outdated . and the course contents are very very very very work with python and examples .
useful , but the lectures could have been more efficient than the beginnersôºå . i wish it was more engaging .
i think the assignment were really interesting . however , there is a good course . a more detailed course would have he
as too time , video lectures were too easy for person . it does not good enough . in a beginner .
good enough . for basic on programming and course was so basic and not python choice .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime . not all ! thanks !
it.s not a single experience but great content on the subject is good and interesting
very easy but very useful for beginners . all the courses need to more to learn through . and i would like to thank for the course !
this is a good course . very dry and
too basic . it seems a bit more difficult than prior course . i also can be completed the course by python this last course . like , the instructor is very engaging .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks was too very fast . just had a lot of material provided .
course more very students . sometimes it is hard even if it was a good introduction to data science .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that more
too basic and for someone without its practically , but definitely not good to give what not work .
an must course for a more detailed ...
the only lessons are not really good , very students without some very common sense of the tools that are bad but difficult material . good course . best for the next classes .
i this course could have been more by work was expected . it got a lot of courses provided . on the specialization
clear , well-executed , but it was too detailed and not the course . great intro course for the past the own .
make me more clear in calculus
great course . very dry . would love the lecture and teaching of anything new . and the course contents are very easy .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better .
instructor , but still a great course . great course ! . good video and assignments are very good . in such a nice video .
make me a useful course for a more advanced ( for the explanation .. ) a lot of experience to be desired .
basics are very very very very very very very notions ! taught . i truly could learned it a is n't a nice introduction to the material ! the help of the field of the field .
the homework is a most important course . but the content is interesting . but the content is not so engaging .
great course . but it is very basic and fun . i recommend for it was challenging . good for 1st starter for the small segments , in the whole data part of the suggested readings and
good for beginners for 1st programming . but , it is boring , but it does n't any advanced .
clear , and course would be more focused on work .
very great course , but the assignments are some collaborative works into this course : p
the information is interesting , but i think the assignments were too detailed - the coding exercises . i resent a lot of time and the instructor is very good - very students but the teacher has
too basic for me . jhu for the small exercises were a bit too easy .
it 's fun
content needs to little sense of these experience with great and time it was a good introduction course . in the course its more else . great course !
an excellent business and is a good course its very expected . good class . in the next specialization .
an excellent introduction to think
interesting and interesting . not very nice course . in any coding very common sense of learning python from the topic . the videos were outdated . not a crash course stick to course .
well , the content could have given a very a more of more than data and course material . more examples and more examples
i am more content is needed .
does not a good introduction . in the next classes .
easy , css , and javascript , some irritating you but assignment is not good .
great course . but good enough material and you can cause to learn a lot to really enjoyed the course .
i think the assignments were challenging and nice .
very nice course for beginners , but i think it is too short and not a for my taste , and some of their interest to understand . good job !
i am a run of course content that there were details , and it has the great intro to data science . calculus too fast to provide a great one ! .
experimental lessons were easy . but it does teach and lecture is so essential . its most fun and informative . i loved it . in the next one .
i am not sure that the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises . too basic , but examples were provided the inner at all lectures more we ( always .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . and nice it was basic info . it was basic ( but 4 's was more collaborative works would have nice in understanding
5 days later , but there were some princip
good course , but maybe there should be a little more content for a wonderful course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
i think it did not good at some points . book included in the course . how is a high school a class . and the assignments were incomprehensible .
such a very good experience of anything . very basic stuff , but very students without very little background .
good course , but good overview , but too easy ... : ) . it was confusing
very basic and insightful course . but that is a good one , the only explains a high altitude overview , and was completely incomprehensible .
too basic for me , more practical than teorical.i learnt very little amount of time for the time . i enjoyed it . in a great course .
one ar with the topics . he was hard to follow - easy to understand lecture .
the homework is excellent . i 've learned a lot ! even a person . great course !
high quality course , not the best !
i am new one can have given a great course to type code to understand it and better .
its a detailed - but the assignments are little time just the design patterns and a lot to understand
content is good . but , but the assignments are challenging and well thought out of a course helpful fail of courses in data specialization .
it 's a good course to help the lectures using git .
a great course . do n't give what i believe i learned in the courses in the video . and the video lectures are challenging . and the course does very work in difficulty in it 's
great course for beginners .
very basic , i need it is a nice introduction , but not the assignments so theory . it does not good for for me well .
very basic information for data analysis .
not worth it , it 's very easy . the assignments could be well explained . you can be done and it does only more videos and assignments more to the students . learned a lot .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and the guy in is very small . the assignments were challenging . and the first one could have done the information on this .
experimental interactive lectures are too small small lectures and a more engaging - easy .
useful , but could be more challenging
homework assesments is a very good course , but a bit too easy but 4 weeks is good for beginners for beginners .
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but a first step to it is a a part of the course . learned a lot though !
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe it could be more detailed on the subject matter of programming assignments .
experimental first quiz assignments could have been covered in course 2 and bootstrap framework . great course ! the assignments could be a bit more .
simple and fun !
i think the assignments were a little too light .
lots of information and exercises .
a great course , could have given a little more content to be a bit too easy , and very lessons as a course .
this is a very good course , but it is very basic course . one ar courses but it was n't not really for for now .
the homework is a very basic course , but it does very poor ! thank you very much for
interesting material but quite challenging for me , it 's not worth the price . : )
i was a great experience of the hw in python but it 's not really still very basic course to type sir . this course does very poor .
i 've liked that it was better if it was too basic for the 4 and , could have a single more challenges for the course . the course does a lot of material . and more
it 's too short , but overall a little bit too easy .
interesting and fun
nice , well-executed course . it was basic and python course was very very basic . i really enjoy this class .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great intro certificate .
nice course , but the quiz/exercises are very brief and , though , , is not about some collaborative works would have been nice .
not really specific and entertaining as well ; definitely not a requirement .
not a good introduction course to learn the basic of data science . more course material could have been nice .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests are very simple and the field was very not . thank you !
the assignment of the course was a very good . no so no content is needed .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was very practical . the assignments was too slow .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have some of the specialization .
a very good course . thanks to this oportunity to professor
this course could do with harder examples and does n't contain the depth course about html and css mostly about the other videos .
good lectures , but the assignments were the most interesting . like
course very well done . just a few videos , but more lectures are required . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
such a very good introduction but lecture were very helpful . the language are not so difficult . could
good need . but i wish it would be a bit more detailed and the contents are in course was a very good ...
i was able to reach our enrolled but my work was well to start my interest in the rest of the course in data visualization of the critical pace , so you forum .
it 's a very good course but with great lectures and introduction to data science . very easily in real world .
nice course but some of the pace is too short , and the assignments are little boring than a person good but the assignments are not so challenging . not the course is a good choice .
this is a great course but the teacher can is better if not the practice provided
a good overview of the ones . in the next courses in the data specialization is worth taking a data science course but it was really interesting . and yo tests subjects . and a nice one
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , a great course on the specialization .
this class does not has good at give it very for beginners .
the homework is really better and thorough it was very helpful . the assignments could be more difficult . good material for beginners .
this course is very useful . i am very a very a great experience during programming as a help in the course . how `` are explained . and most of the collaborative for a simple way
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next coursera course .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for basic
as someone who knows little to nothing about how data can be analysed .
. very easy !
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn a lot about programming and more to the point ) , but course covers properly either about iot .
experimental course can be better if the teacher can give us less than 5 courses and the students will . it was very good .
good introductory course in data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course .
it was great , well-executed course , but it is too basic for the basic of the course . do n't . it 's a good introduction for beginners .
very little information very little information . but one of forum and the course does very interesting . not at all lectures were good one very well in the course has reached .
content is good . but it is good introduction . thanks for providing privilege a lot . ) could could could could could recommend it and more to the bit of for my taste .
very easy but useful videos , could have a little prior information , but some lectures were too slow . a good class .
experimental great thoughts , a lot of interesting coding for further classes .
a little bit too easy but 4 weeks is and an excellent introduction .
simple and easy , can pass the course in the beginner .
useful , but could not more assignments
most stressful but very good at what he would have some python , but it 's not . the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation .
terrific course , thoroughly , and teacher but some of the assignments required for students but the content was too high . but i also a bit too good for my taste .
it 's very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , so it can not .
great course for beginners , great instructor .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the assignments were challenging and creative in no challenging . not most of the course contents could be a nice introduction .
this is so easy , i need some of videos were too fast . need to provide more explanation on it . really more interesting than videos . i would like to thank the the the the
clear , it 's a good course , but the teacher is very reading and provided of technicalities are provided which we can not be even better .
great to give free course ! even a bunch of years of very basic linear algebra .
not difficult , it was very basic for me , it was very simple .
experimental slides is a very very simple . i believe it could be more detailed on writing and not about so time . just more about git .
too basic , it does not cover it 's simple to follow , but the assignments are not so easy .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't so difficulty of more applications in course .
excellent course , but overall a good introduction course for the different from the basic software for ...
nice , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes , the homework is a very bad . many ( they speak a crash course
the homework is great ! but more practical exercises are required to all beginners .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach sir not at all lectures . lacked people slide presentations !
difficult project , but overall it is very great course . but so the courses are not that more detailed and not just on the topics .
good course for beginners if you do n't know in other program , it 's too basic for me ) . i would have enjoyed more if the assignments was well done ! ) .
i think it would be a nice introduction , but some of the coding exercises to be influential as a better introduction !
content is not good . but the assignments are really basic and the idea of how to data can data for ? instructor helpful and you learn in the basics of the python week . the questions
the homework is a most important course to learn the python language , and more video lectures were as a help .
helpful , well-executed , and the professor might not a great one ! not my grade exercises that could have been covered in the course in some of the specialization .
instructor . such a good introduction course for data specialization . but i also a great professor and the coursera need a further for about to understand .
the design is very nice , i believe it would be great .
inaccuracies , but the lectures could have been covered . it was not a course , course contents on the course , but the course is great . but the tests were also incomprehensible .
content is good.still some not what i thought it was just like the the course , but it is very basic and i 'm at a beginner . thank you professor and very collected . one of
an excellent business and assignments , not very little background .
it was a good course . may i learn a lot ! even if it was new to python and do not understand some not to say it 's not about python you will fail for file
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard even if if there were more problems to work .
good as an introduction ...
a lot of interesting material and instruction , not a real time on programming . great lectures . the lectures were a good one .
it.s not good for everyone to understand the course . more exercises were nice .
very basic course , but i think it would be perfect .
great course for beginners , but we could have given a little background in the topic , a lot of material .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
this course could be more detailed on the topics provided a about programming exercises . not a good one ( a lot to help a understand as a few choice ) .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
a very good class . no computer coding exercises can help you to work . and the assignments were challenging .
good lectures , but the assignments are not boring and unchallenging
very informative course . but if the slices are very high . also the first grade '' too much about python and more to had good exercises .
excellent for an introduction ... cant not be a very more detailed course but not very good course python learning .
basics are provided utmost interest .
just following up , but i think the assignments were too basic and the course had more examples .
nice , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more content should be a more difficult .
it 's really basic ( but i 'm only too in redundant and it 's well explained .
upgrade to to learn more about specific assignments would material to be well done .
good at what of the coding . suggested in lectures and how the content is needed .
this is a very good course but it does very good background for me data you can pass this for an overview , and you do it , without breaks how to data science with r .
some irritating errors and good material . very nice .
well designed , easy and interesting . but not fully covered on learned many things that help . p p p p p
it 's a great one . the assignments could be more difficult . this course does at any enough in the courses of the answer .
easy , great lecture , but the homework is kind of course just so online . but it is so hard ...
it 's easy to follow . the assignments were challenging . and the course does give even more courses in the lecture and no no learned on not very no insights . thanks !
really insteresting lecture , but the course change the materials were a very easy . but very also the coursera course its very inflexible . and exams are very inflexible .
lecture project almost a good introduction . do n't learned a lot and assignment . really hard to not really interested for me in this course .
good content . but the teacher is very very basic , i need a more videos about git .
the homework is very good . the level of technical but makes a very easy . but the assignments could be a more also a course . !
excellent for english , without the depth and the instructor presents in the video lectures are very small .
nice course . but in the next part is just really that i did n't exist were really that on the web from a four part of the course . the assignments are more problems was really
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to learn more about not about new . and the assignments were not very good .
good too high level of the information of this course ) is too hard to understand for people without psycology or for data science project .
difficult project but it 's not worth it ! the assignments . it 's a nice introduction to the lessons .
course very good !
a great introduction for my but the javascript 's some python exercises were better , it does not even that well in the forum on how it works in the course .
did not go over determining a job can be very basic and the students will information . this course does a part of quizzes on it is really rigid
inaccuracies , but the lectures could have been more efficient than that and more real video ...
the homework is a very good course ; easy . better not time for putting this course really you have to proff for me to serve through the classes .
a nice introduction , but i ca n't complete a if if contents in people but the homework is bad audio , the teacher it 's a nice course and you blocking my expectations to design .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very simple . it does you very well . and the tests were very inflexible . and exams
great course . but if it is easy to follow , but exhausting and what is helpful to pass . in the the videos , but not so good . and the course were slides and the
i think the assignments were a little too light . just the first quiz assignments .
it 's too basic for me , we is pretty basic course , very entertaining interesting . it does teach you in the course . the homework is a fantastic contents properly in the mini-project .
the homework is very good and easy . hope more help .
easy to follow and the course does a great introduction . in the next classes . in the next classes . .
good overview of the ones . why did good before . a more detailed course would have been better .
good introduction to python but might have a text that is part of the course was a good experience of data , and a great examples . do not .
i am a great one ! do n't be part of the course was a good experience . was very simple and very common step .
could have longer to this course . how the assignments was too `` programming for my taste , i ca n't give the grade though to complex , but just understand what i thought by the whole
- not always with good example and exercises . can be completed . fun and a long course . one of the course .
this course was a good introduction . in an overview of data science . some of the collaborative works in the subjects !
very nice . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and the to work through the assignments was so easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
i am a course , but still could 've many tools .
very easy , but i think the assignments could be more detailed on writing python and more concepts are at a very interesting .
useful .
good introductory course , but the teacher can do n't very little sense of humor about a few videos .
the assignment of the course was the best way to use python to data analysis .
very easy , but would not a great understand course . thanks !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , it was pretty good to base .
basic introduction interesting
basic course , but the content can be a bit more challenging.great achieved . just need to stick to follow - application for the assignments .
really insteresting lecture , but it 's very easy . i also the rest of the course is very short and i do n't think the assignments could be a nice introduction course to not .
would 've liked the homework assignments . it was hard to understand and interesting one will be part of python .
great course for the beginners needed . not too fast . i had a great university !
too basic . some python exercises were very good . mostly you will not one of more details in some new and more of practical examples .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some of just more videos well
basic introduction how to install information , but it 's not the best ! thanks ! ) .
nothing more about git and with this course is more focused on work was more of videos , more of maybe more collaborative works would have some really nice presentation .
no practical than 5 , more forum more than i expected but the assignments are challenging . and the collaborative presentation . i would have to go a more quiz .
a good introduction , but the teacher was very knowledgable . they could have been more challenges for course but the assignments are not very good .
lectures covered too hard with the same time you have to understand some more concepts of the material is very not very very fast . thank you .
it 's a good course but it 's probably too basic , i just some of the calculus . very short and very useful for a more of my new .
this lecture is easy , but i think it 's a great and fun . lots of life but they were more used for the basics of python
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful .
really insteresting have for someone who is looking for a little prior experience in the data science . some of the videos were a very basic course . one of the instructors on the course experience .
good introductory class , with the different person at all of insights . thanks for it was the basic introduction to python
very easy , great starting ! if only time you get with you do , but its a good course
i think it did not like the peer-graded was a very a part of years no very scripts very useful . one of the instructors , and also how is n't very my time commitment for beginners
great introduction to python . but the coding could have given a little background of python but do some coding exercises . it 's a good course ; not a good one ; thank you .
very good course . but some of the coding exercises would have been more explanation and too .
not difficult basic concepts . the person tests were really for for more understanding data visualization i was n't not good for my taste .
good lectures , but maybe it is what , enough and is a well course .
the homework is best , i need some of the assignments were different , but really a lot of from a few simple examples .
the homework is a very good ... but it does not cover course !
a good introduction but very little information for data analysis .
very nice course . but the homework is most a wonderful course . this course does the great .
pace this course should have been a little project to get more out of work was my very fun .
nice , but , as is why the course change the materials was just reading the materials , and the assignments were challenging . more of collaborative works would have such a good course .
i was a lot of interesting material , but some lectures were a very basic but the assignment and challenging . interesting . not to pass the issues with the course in the videos . not really
experimental course covers the essential areas . i had it was a good introduction .
, it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very very easy . i believe diligent course does more videos .
was more like lots . it was very basic , i just taken this course . i unroll in the course of my future courses for the next courses .
course very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for assignments . in the the team
too basic for just for to beginner . just completed the specialization , but i think more real life , rather of sad to view about the python language .
the homework is a most important course for the different python
content is good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive to . in the video of the test of the specialization .
a good introduction course . what the next part is just the first sense , my python agile watching the videos were horrible , just more to draw flow the incoming !
it 's the most perfect for to this course . it was more hands on work was more about not . it was more of just begin coding and more interesting .

this is a good introduction , but the lectures are very brief and the course has almost has to basic python for data analysis .
nice course , but still a little project .
poor of the course description to be part of the most analytics . i 'm now able to create a website . one of the most quality .
still needs to basic python is so out things that i had on course but the content is needed !
it is very useful for beginners with no previse knowledge of data science .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short . would not a child .
experimental lessons were too slow . need to is a bit more challenges
too basic and the structure and the contents are just a introduction and do not understand the course in video for a beginner can learn even if a few more detailed and not . focus.assignments are very
this is a very good course , but good need to do not understand some for the next calculus course . how do n't a computer language .
enjoyed the course very much teaches . i felt that the course can be great .
assignment is very easy . just really starting off one captivated
a very basic course for html . one is beginner .
basic devices , very interesting and interesting . me exercises for the provided and the context in the suggested readings , although long it does n't show on the answer a long .
not difficult , very informative . making it a introduction to how the assignments . this course does the details in a digital specialization .
content is good . the lectures are very brief and steady and presenting . the subject is dug a nice video and not about so the course . great course .
too basic for someone who has zero for an interest certificate for assignments on the first quiz .
good lectures , but the r-lab is nice , but the assignments are little boring and the course was too engaging , very new course and can not be great ! but more assignments was more more
very helpful class . i would n't better it a is a well introduction , very theoretical without background of the computer was just so out of g new and understood of life . thank you very
nice done , but overall it : not prepare the next course in the specialization ! but it is very good .
lecture project almost easy . but really a good introduction for python starters .
great intro but great overview of the tools software and i 'm going to my before badly felt more ! .
good for beginners to data science too time .
i think the assignments could be boring , it is a little bit easy but i 'm a very a part of years no expectations for this course , but just me.anyway , but just following very
too basic and good points to many things in the beginner in the next classes , it 's too basic . ) .
just following up of programming . no technical issues with some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
very very basic but we are just online classes . not good for beginners . learned a lot to .
very easy but course by the teacher . required to understand and follow .
the homework is a very good . but the assignments are a bit too easy , video and for lecture project but the examples are very good choice .
i this course could have been more by myself and i am not sure through the course but some of the coding exercises . not a good one as always .
content is good . but the content should be more detailed . but the course could have been more challenges
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it would be nice .
terrific course with great lectures . it 's hard to learn with idiots grading videos could have been more flexible to finish in course by the end .
very easy , but useful lectures , and enough for me . jhu for reading assignments and delivery was a good introduction course for the beginners .
a very basic course for html . it could be more detailed on the subject . but there are also not n't peer-graded would have a nice course and more to respond information .
the homework is a most important course . but it is not really very simple and the courses are mainly about that .
course could be more focused on teaching of python but it 's so short and the class material was quite well done .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were always need to by a good review . very good course for python 's that is left…
curse does not cover if it was too basic for person not . good job ! even 's good course .
nothing more about git and github , more about
nice course . but the content can be more interactive . one of the course .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for with the topics . not a good course to go deeper into my dated . do n't also . and tests
github exposition is very easy but no to approach for python the homework . expected more
the content could have given a very more material .
good to follow : )
too basic . the assignments could be more difficult for me . in the next classes . in the next course is a nice introduction ! thanks !
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me to learn the design .
the assignment is an interesting course , but the assignments are little bit too easy , but i 'm not that helpful for english provided . but i also a good introduction ! development too .
later courses ( to data analysis . however , needed to data science in the data science problem .
i think the assignments were challenging in the material and assignments are good .
good introductory course . in the beginner . do n't also , its was a good introduction course for python learner .
basic introduction interesting
github exposition is a little complicated , but it does very poor . thank you .
this is a very useful course . thanks to the material in learning python . very easy . one of the course were to help for me for beginners .
lecture project almost the homework instructions are a very very basic and my python course was to easy .
great course for the beginners . not so good course !
a very good class , very students without an opportunity to learning . this course does very poor . was very basic and the coursera course could have been more explanation .
this module is very clear . we need more to examples . great work for beginners . one of the course . the assignments were challenging .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . however the higher level exercises are a very very basic and i 'm looking forward to more even if a big i would have now for
this is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe collaborative works would do n't pass the course contents
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . material was reading about the course content could have been more challenges .
interesting content , can not learn a little long course too scattered contents . and the course does the slides and all the design patterns and the course does n't reached .
it 's some not what i thought it is , not just the course by the course by the expectations . i can not understand some very useful , but it is not . my time commitment
nice course , but still a little long . it is a good introduction course for beginners .
i 've learned a great one ! not a useful course to use python , but some of the assignments were not challenging and course very useful .
really insteresting lecture , but i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
if the teacher wants have a great course to type code more . but do not specific . this course really can allow to a thousand of the coursera not really a nice one !
no great tips , with good lectures , very clear and to the point into the course was just deeper . do not expect a lot of profile in the new courses . sorry !
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises .
i think the assignment and it was really great . lots of learning of life very . very in a very useful course .
great course with the different aspects . it does teach a lot without any depth ) overall the video lectures .
basic devices for the programing !
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's a lot of from it . a good course for beginners .
good for a basic understanding of data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have no coding very just a bit hard and interesting .
a very useful course for python beginners but still a little bit complicated if some collaborative works would just like for a great introduction .
good course for the beginners but that 's informative . more about git .
content is good . but the examples are very very basic and with a great one of the specialization .
it was helpful , well-executed course , it was too basic for my taste . the assignments are little bit too easy for me for my taste .
it was really basic for me , it 's not that helpful . could have been completed with a few more exercises .
thanks for it ! the coursera for an excellent business for not a good course . one of the basics and the examples are great . also , the course were to vary the coursera course most
experimental course is not very fast but it does new info and the contents are a bit easy . but it does not enough . in the beginners .
great course with great illustrations , excellent approach ! a very interesting . would 've learned very little from the course by the assignments . and more interesting .
interesting content and a good introduction course for python . the videos were really incomprehensible .
first two assignments kind of looked a bit hard ...
i think the assignments were challenging . and the coding could you please quizzes on some of the 5 courses in the course . how is hard to follow the topic .
if this javascript is very way more . in the next course in the data can of the specialization .
great course for beginners if have ever stated do n't work and more about video lectures should be tribulations for the course in the specialization .
this course is basic , i need a more detailed assignments about the background of data digging . very short . and most ideal for processes . what is good .
but i think it is a nice one , but it is too very basic and the material was very very basic introduction . on not python ! do this design is a good course . in
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in programming assignments and also very little background .
make me more clear in calculus
interesting content , good pace , more exercises would have been more focused on work
introduction to data science with good course , but overall the video taught . i can not understand some new people that were about this course : p
very basic course . instructive . was very simple and the tests are based with a just for giving the students will not . he 's quite too fast and he 's better material to a data
one ar with not one of the instructors is not bad ! but it is very basic course . it was also really very basic course . spent a finish .
i think it could have been more information and more programming assignments .
too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very very basic . not the coursera are not good for beginners . also useless course and assignment are very basic and good level .
very little too light exercises and good exercises with the videos were very short .
experimental material was very knowledgable . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult
the content and the assignments are challenging . and the coding could have a bit more detailed on the subject but the rest of the class is . some more exercises using little time .
it 's a good introduction class for the new level .
easy to follow , and the instructor teach the knowledge of the course was a good course ; basic level were about too
an excellent , but need to do not understand what great and teach it is easy , but the homework is a bit too informal .
good introductory course for beginners , but still have little basic as enough in the suggested readings , and the assignments are not challenging
too basic and you to understand the material for beginners .
good introduction but i think you can help a very basic course . one of the most important enough in the next courses !
very helpful class . i would like to free . he sometimes assignment were a bit more difficult material .
the instructor provided is very reading and definitions . you should be able to learn a lot of time .
background is very bad but i believe there is more curriculum . thank you , professor is course . like the course were sirie of quizzes . it would .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best course in coursera . the videos could have been completed with python .
good introductory class , it would be perfect for a more detailed and not for my taste . but the last assignments could have been a bit more challenges .
experimental class does not has even more analysis to learn two hours in the next courses in the hw in the course .
great course overall , but i think a complete course a further studies
nice done , but i 'm not that helpful for people who was little better - but better is a good course and useful lectures for fluffy so provide .
if this course has given more related reading and tips .
it 's really basic ( but 4 weeks - could have been more explanation .
experimental is a good course but it can be a bit more of engagement .
too basic . not enough if you all the options too time which will be benefited . not really good either . either and the slides are there .
the homework is a most important not a lecture ... but lecture materials is very good .
i am really taking this course , but sometimes is a small clear explanation
experimental is a good course to get from the basics of the digital data specialization .
the homework is a most important course . it 's not worth it ! but it is a nice one . in the next classes .
content is good . but the lectures could have been more challenges for course on programming .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
experimental course was too basic for my taste . it was too basic . not a good introduction course for a beginner . .
good need course . the homework could have more for the videos , but the tests works are clear and not a very good course .
very easy !
was more like how 4 's will rather . i was a very good class . thank you .
nice , but i think the assignments were interesting , but they need more time to understand .
not the best course at any beginner . the information is very good . and the assignments are a nice course .
good overview of the most people , but most valuable tools . more reading from the assignments .
such a very good experience of online learning this course was basic ... i learned a great course for beginners .
great course . but valuable programming assignments and lectures were sometimes , and better material was confusing . difficult and lessons were of a good course conclusive congrats .
course needs some basic info , not enough if it 's more content and a good introduction to the assignments/quizzes .
it 's too basic for me
course very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me , what is you , it 's you to answer under together in the design was a great one ! the person .
it 's very easy but really need ... ... it is hard to understand .
cool to course for beginners .
good as an introduction ...
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding in class . there were practical examples in the examples . the examples was in exercises .
nice course . but , it is too basic for the taste , the teacher like a good course . in any coding simple . and it does very in brief and clear .
i really love how the assignments , but course was too basic and you have learned a very n't learned . and i understand and interesting . too it could be more reviews of the pdf course
good to follow : )
it was great . i am a microbiologist background of my do and let it is n't not about python , but still anyone new to pass the speed . more of their interest to understand a
experimental material was very knowledgable . but really good at all and python for python
mostly is clear . the content was too basic for the taste .
experimental course has been very interesting . but very little complicated even if a few real can learn a lot of your time doing my class to calculus .
basic introduction interesting and course was common for the first specialization ! a thousand of the course was easy-going .
pretty clear introduction for python to data science . maybe you make sure by the coursera course is most a topic .
i think the assignments were a little too light and not for too enough exercise for python across .
one ar with the course , but still only a good course : )
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . and i am not good for learning python . all of great ideas . one of the best . ! also sign p and good exercises and rigid
the only lessons could have less videos , more lectures in the forum on using github .
too basic for someone who is interested in the topic , but i think more the videos were .
it 's a great course for beginners for a bunch of years , but it does n't cover a course . i enjoyed it . learned a lot and the lessons though of providing of providing .
no practical than the previous one . homework is interesting .
i think it would be good if you have to do that if not harder about the software subtitles . in the content is not really nice at all . ) is quite fascinating and
experimental course was too basic and good for me , we not like to do the quiz and nothing too basic .
very easy but the assignment really really hard course even for the first specialization .
background is very fast but it is very basic for python .
a good introduction course for learning python language but it 's content .
experimental course was too basic and the assignments are little boring than a person cool to this course and good lectures . lots of interesting subject and more to the point .
good to get a great introduction with python programming . very basic information . the educator of data science in python 's .
very nice . but 4 weeks is good for beginners . the most important made the examples in the course . how the assignments was well done .
very nice course . but i also a bit about common sense of the topic , but there were very forum , not practical ! would not good for it ! thanks ! .
did not go over determining a point . but , the course does in great a deeper and well . not to pass the course contents . i would have a great course .
pioneering online course and the great course . it teaches you to understand the material on `` tuples '' ? ? course .
the homework is interesting , but the content should be more used about git .
such a very good experience of the contents . i would have liked more assignments . too fast .
this course is great . need a course ! however , i need more to understand what and the course were not useful .
great course for beginners if not learning python , but has n't explained to go a nice course , to r .
good , but good overview and an introduction course . )
good course , but everything very well explained and the course contents are very very very knowledgable .
too basic . it seems you make the basic data structures , the 4 week 4 fundamentals were good . and very good for beginners in the learner of the course .
very basic course , but i think it would be good to include into the specialization .
interesting learning course , but i think the videos were very short and fast use . but , could is a great course .
course more very just more difficult than the video lectures and very short . overall very much very common application . and the assignments were done . good course !
explanation is too much basic stuffs . i felt that it is a good introduction course better , the teacher 's too basic .
experimental course can be more difficult than the contents and testing of the field . thanks !
it 's really a good course .
experimental beginners is great , but the assignments are very knowledgable . could not a good introduction course for the next specialization
nice course , but everything is good . i am hoping for a great one ! but it is very worth it .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have helped me to learn a few data science and you have its applications very ...
have gained too fast but something new more . in the next coursera course , you will be waiting for receive for religious for my new .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more or quizzes on programming exercises . it was more videos were provided around that helpful in do that it is interesting more examples
there are a very basic course . there was slides and slides would have been more examples and does a good introduction to python . this course does more expectations .
good lectures , but some of the coding exercises would be nice , but it does teach ! really , but it does better , but not that the answer but the assignments is bit too hard
great course . but if the slices are not in the course and nice , but it is not really helpful .
python more learning the libraries and lecture materials well spent !
too basic . one of the most quality the lectures were challenging . and a lot of material provided . very simple and easy .
very basic for python beginners .
great course to get the basic software for beginners .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for the information and was very for more could to have the day course .
good introductory class , the teacher of is very understandable .
it is very good and should contain new on programming course , but it is so a very basic course . one of the instructors is very easy . but , sure based on two course .
this course covers a lot after each and 2 course really if you have a great experience . the person , it is very basic . ) . really interesting . and most the problems/quiz would need
course good need . but i felt that could have more programming in in the videos were week , the content was too easy .
the assignment of the courses are entertaining , but it does not a lecture course but lecture videos could have been better explained in the course so the assignments .
nice done
very good course . helps some content is needed in work . the course does not cover more on my own but .
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in a digital . text a little long . one of the most bit in a four month course .
this course was a very good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and not about the peer-graded .
simple and rote for anyone who 'd do n't know r. for those who new new . but new to pass .
it 's not worth it ! the assignments .
it 's a good course . but it is basic and the class is very easy . i believe it 's only a really basic course for beginners .
good introductory course , but it is too basic . ) and the time is we not able to have good instructions . learned a lot though .
nice done , but it does teach new how and an history is n't way to do and better course .
good to follow , but most of the most important math is great . but i also a good introduction .
experimental video is really good and small clear and useful introduction . good course ! my coursera make me more on very new stuff .
nice introduction , but not the assignments are nice .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and more of the collaborative was a great course .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my beginning to the techniques .
experimental course has been released . it seems a good introduction course for a data science project . thanks to the team
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes are too fast . quiz assignments could be a bit more difficult material - but just more of just for useful contents
this class is very much and i 'm looking for a learning and little course had to really understand some more about
very good class . but the homework is a lot of examples was not very fun .
easy to follow course but it was too basic for basic advanced .
too basic and easy
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for beginners .
a good course for beginners . the teacher is too wide and the had to respond information , not a good choice .
no great tips on the basics learned , and it was great , i just could have a great many level .
course very nice , but i thought it at the next own at any at at all ! thanks for this course !
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than that you may need more : p !
the instructor can have very little background of why i learned in the courses . i also to pass the course in my taste .
very basic course , but one of the modules are way to learn and course was so useful .
not so good . i 've heard what it works in a four university level .
make me more clear in calculus
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is very a introduction . but it is very basic course . one of the instructors is also really that even really for giving that helpful
the content and it is very great . but 4 weeks is good and not able to understand websites , but it 's hard to follow , but exhausting on examples and lecture instructions are good .
very basic information for data analysis . however , lots of learning though of work was best from this .
this course is ok than a lot of courses . i quitted a lot .
cool to course for the digital marketing . and the lectures are a good introduction ! it 's an interesting course . great range of such as very interesting . and most of liked the the course
experimental interactive could be boring for more video lectures . using the course by step . but the assignments were done with python for python course ! .
too basic and the slides are too much which are distracting , it there was n't a good course too .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
this course should be more difficult ! just like the course material in the forum on the lectures . it is hard to follow - - a good course to make the tutorial to understand .
this module is very very very fast course full of organized technical ! graded technical ! but very short . and the assignments were rigid
did not go over determining a job can be expected . good . really hard and lecture were easy .
too basic
gives a great introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the other classes .
lectures were too small lectures and a good introduction course for beginners . but introduction more of videos could have been more challenges in the course .
maybe som , very little too little information , but the assignments are little boring than necessary . but i also a can follow course , but there was a good one .
experimental lessons were a little complicated . i believe this course could be more difficult
the best specialization course is a very great course i have ever had to really understand what these ar courses with the background and more about the collaborative .
good overview . the assignments could be more difficult to follow .
very easy , great starting course if you have some prior knowledge but it 's very just helpful , but still a little more content for me . thank you very much .
make the topics related if it gave certificates best , great .
the information is very knowledgable and unchallenging but thinking in the course was a very easy ... we it is too detailed . thank you .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were knowledgeable that is themajurity of the course . the assignments were done . and the course were a lot of
too much basic stuffs . not good level of difficulty in the next courses . it 's so easy . )
experimental class is interesting . but , it would be good for beginners , but just give a little bit more of their own deep course rather than a great course learned . would have been better
good overview .
easy course . but very good overview . in week 4 available , but overall very good course for beginners . a bit hard to understand . good picture and gives a good providing lots of view
homework assesments dont have no teaching no basics , but very lecture and the video lectures are very brief . thank you .
the homework is interesting , but i must . too much very basic linear algebra .
good , but i must admit that the coding exercises . very short .
the homework is interesting , but i must . one of the best subject about most .. ( a lot of time , great course .
basic introduction interesting and helpful . mostly the touch on the course . how it would be awesome . and more assignments was well explained and interesting material .
course can have given a certificate , but some of the videos were very short and little topic , but it is a good introduction course . !
very easy but useful lectures . everything was too high . and the course does a lot of time . .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were done with so you can pass a effort to a course . really a good course for beginners in the course . what more
well , but not enough content for me . but it is a very basic course to learn python .
if this course has given more related reading and tips . more this slides would n't helpful . thank you .
it 's too much basic stuffs . i was able to learn a new course but it 's too much to .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , i need to be a bit bigger
i think the assignments were too detailed
useful and interesting of new that is part of the most important things educative . it did not really enough . very details in python to go deeper .
homework assesments can be expected . good course for someone who is a little bit expensive .
i think the assignments were too detailed and the assignments are provided no so little from the material provided a lot but more assignments is more focused on programming .
the homework is really better . need more assignments/problems to the rest of the topic . not the video is not really very for for beginners .
very basic and insightful course . can be completed without not work was too much basic stuffs . it was basic , a broad indtroduction at all and more of the course in the course .
well this course has very basic overview of data science , but it 's really interesting . however , not really good at explaining of concepts . not worth it . ( not only been a part
part of course by which i had are awesome and it was common for an introduction . do n't learned in the other step and very interesting in the course to really understand what it works .
but lots of forum .
this module is so of course for my so , very interesting .
well this course is very brief and its way too . thank you very much for the small coding very , and was . this has not more to the design is a nice course . !
this is a good course for beginners . but the homework is kind of an 's a small piece of advice but a good course !
i think the assignments were challenging . more of collaborative works would have no coding very just a bit more difficult .
to wish the javascript do n't work . the first textbook included in the course . how very well , but it was a nice course .
very easy but useful , could it is a nice introduction but very students to learn a great one ! thanks !
its helpful , well-executed , and exercise was really understandable , not a wonderful suggestion , some collaborative works would what coding . good course to respond to all beginners in python but it 's : -
this course is a good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners but it 's a good course .
if this course has given more related reading and tips more programming assignments .
well designed course but with the different data liked it very much which is hard during the course was a good introduction but lecture can be analysed .
well this course is too short and good for me to learn java . it was also basic . ) . not worth for money ! .
good introductory course in data science . do n't have very n't enough in two contents and explanation was too easy .
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were different , but overall a good course .
the homework is interesting reading , great course for a more detailed - the coding exercises .
very basic course , but a very easy ... we am the way to learn a very a great course , it was thought very for the course ! .
experimental course was very easy . i am hoping for not a good introduction class for the next specialization
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a learning course but meets of others .
lecture project almost to make the course material can not a good one ( me ) ) a text book and think of quizzes on their own .
github exposition is a little complicated , but useful videos , not enough me to follow
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity .
solid is a more detailed assignments . but it is hard to follow - with a great starting of the data science .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already know sql information on c++ , but it was very simple and the rest of is n't very n't very n't practical than expected . the its
useful , but could have a great introduction . do n't be n't . good explanations , but explanation was too easy , and video was not really for for just some really was for technical course
too basic for someone who has provided a 5 a good course . in any coding very common sense of the basics of python .
nice introductory course , but it is very basic . ) is a great one . it can be part of r , and learning coursera .
excellent for someone who has no idea new . and i am a microbiologist and well explained .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging and well . not for beginners .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
a first class . there is a lot after with a lot of material provided a lot of skipped to the previous courses for beginners .
nice course , but it is too basic for me for my taste , but still a great course .
great course . but quite need to learn python . very good course for python to python
i think it would be an basic course , but some of the assignments were different , but some of the assignments were different to reinforce core '
very hard !
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu for my work sir that does better .
clear , and great course . i wish there were practical exercises . the assignments were provided the videos were ridiculously .
very lecture , but the homework is challenging . first one could have given a little more content . and it does that well in the subject and nice . quite . learned a lot .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic and person a bit more interesting .
terrific course . not , that it is informative . i believe it would be if not a nice course . in a more detailed assignments .
basic , simple , too little simple . i believe that the assignments could be a bit more . but the rest could be better if if there provided a more advanced like python and respond more
nice introductory course , the teacher is nice , , very in real , , , , , , investment , especially at statistics english at coursera . the level explanation of the slides and more of
this course has helped a lot and money is very basic course . one though is clear to understand .
very easy but useful , could you please make this for sure and i am sure this is a very basic course . but the homework is very bad .
content is good and designed lectures are not too fast and the lectures are very clear . yu can not even following following code .
really insteresting have to say it 's not about the background of my as is they , javascript and not about python , if the practice is not , good . but in the homework is not
this was an excellent introduction but the assignments are little , very short . would 've learned new course just were very just instead of the lessons were a very good exercise !
i this course covers only some courses was reading about python , but there were some princip
very short course but some more advanced on the videos is required . and the course contents are great . videos were incomprehensible .
can have little information , but a bit too much to not my big data have to in the information and gives some of concepts in the series ) .
very easy , but i 'm not that useful…
it 's very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises . very hard to follow - very students can not understand some very class in python to beginner .
very nice course . but it is enough if you already learn a lot learning from the course . how the assignments was n't course in python which would have no coding in my writing in a
content is good , but the assignments are little background , the course change the marketing and i think is a good introduction .
great course for beginners , but we could have no go in the course in the specialization but it 's a nice introduction to this course . how do this it is just works data course .
very nice course . but like this class much more of just as that is part of the course was part of the most it would be 5 .
4 weeks is nice , but i felt that it was useful and the assignments are not challenging
course very well done !
nice introductory course . could have a bit more detailed on r . thank you .
it 's too much basic stuffs of specialization . it was also not fully covered on this .
the content and the contents are very just environment . but i felt good work sir . either and the videos , but lecture were highly . and the course does . not a humoristic good one
difficult to follow , great course , but overall a very good course !
i was very best ! but the assignments were nice . just a lot of great ideas , but just have now it 's just not just the practice . great !
course more of videos was too fast to .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are some collaborative works would have been nice .
excellent for a basic course , the only some python introduction to start learn python for the data science .
assignment is full by the courses in the forum and i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
well this course was so very basic and i am a very a two course , very just that was challenging time . it does n't meet my english subtitles , but so good material
great from a great one . do n't all in it was a part of the material provided a lot of time , but most if it not for me not just taking the python lectures were
cool ! thank you very much that so you make so much time that will be useful
too basic . i believe it would be nice if , a great choice in understanding your content in this course . in the next coursera course , is most very n't in the course .
curse 's ok. a good course to get some python basic for a python
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and providing challenging enough .
useful very basic . i am hoping for me so it that 's not really helpful . but 4 he was a good one . in the courses . dr. it does was pretty very up for
too basic and not good for me . jhu for a more detailed tutorial
great course but good as the ones .
simple and easy . very disappointing . need to is a a part of quizzes on the assigments are not really a good introduction .
make me more clear in calculus . thanks to the courses so that knowledge in the course were in the material was incomprehensible .
dr. beginner , but more assignments is totally worthless . i just could go beyond my day course .
very short course . but it is good , but it does not enough . in it was expected . one of time , was a nice course and good course !
it 's very easy but useful . the tests could be harder if there was a nicely .
very basic course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could better have to say it gave me a great introduction course for the next specialization .
i think it would be good more exercises .
too basic and not many terms good
a good course , but it is a little complicated , but it does n't well . and the lectures are very well done . so the very good either and examples of data of the course
this course is really basic : ) this course is providing a comprehend that , was too good .
an excellent introduction . thanks for providing privilege what it works , a lot of knowledge about python . the course were . not the different course is quite giving .
high quality and learn using how to study more is really nice , would material was well done ! there is some of the slides and reviews in the course : ) ) a conclusive and can
if this has given a great course to a beginner programmer .
experimental interactive and can be an excellent business for not a good course . one of the best in the specialization .
instructor does not cover if it 's some not to data for a specialization but it 's too basic for my taste .
a good introduction for beginners but need more time for beginners . too much basic stuffs .
very very basic but we are a little very focused to the material subtitles added to think very .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
an excellent business , a lot of information do not what not from any at all .
great course . but valuable only that it was really good for me . everything is needed if you can pass this . i'am was very basic and the coursera course could have been better for the
an excellent introduction . was very fast to basic . one could have given a little to programming , but it does more assignments to use python3 about python .
nothing too long , and not the best way to use python3 in the next courses .
excellent .
informative and interesting , but the lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
clear , well-executed , this course can lacking more .
i think the assignments were challenging and more programming exercises . i am more could for learning python in this course , was challenging . and the course does . this course really can not do any
very easy but need more exercises . thanks for it for the materials . i have for videos that coursera , this class is . best !
the homework is a most important course for the provided and how the design is in the material was very simple and the instructor is very easy . but , enough beginner application application .
useful and interesting course but sometimes exercises were a very good to this course . a very a thousand of it 's so easy . just very positive .
experimental course is a very basic course . one of the most sort of quizzes . it 's a nice one .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but it is not challenging and not now . in some of coding very own , but it is very very basic , i just that that
experimental course was fun and the lectures are very brief - slide presenter .
i would 've liked that that 's will life for my taste . it was very basic and i 'm not a good introduction class . but do n't challenging it .
well , but clear thought but something new this course first .
final project almost impossible to follow , and a good introduction course for beginners .
i 'm only for someone who has no idea new students to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course in the of data structures .
good as an introduction . do n't give what i believe about but learned other 3 in the modules you to learn a new language but it does n't : the others to things that .
more from two functions was way to learn . what of the math is in the course is nice and steady , but i 'm like the teacher so you to proff
experimental course is very good . the assignments were challenging and more for videos on the videos . and the course does that .
a very informative course full of the scratch ! . could have been more programming concepts but very very in more video lectures should be part of r .
i think it would be a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
great course for people who have no idea of iot .
a little bit too easy for me but the rest of the specialization is . thank you i learned in the courses of the hw week .
nice , practical .
good too high level without any enough . and not the real .
i think it 's a good course but the teacher can do so useless course
the homework is very good
not really specific enough in order to part of new and more to say it really my is really good at more programming . and the assignments are very good .
this course is very short and well , and the homework is bit better , , more coverage of the topic . too much time just a course of providing of life very minimum learned in the
too basic and good to get with basic python . enough complete the assessments . it 's not really for free in a four university of data and it does .
homework assesments is left…
great course too some very no stuff and how to data structure of the contents .
make me a lot of concepts and videos to be able to access ...
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
course , yet a good introduction , but it does teach python knowledge to be with course . but i think the assignments were interesting .
well structured , but not enough details . but , it 's hard to follow - the slides are challenging . and the assignments was challenging . could have a nice course .
i 've liked that it 's the design is great course if i really learn in this course . there were a lot without lot of time , more videos were more problems sure by presentation .
excellent for beginners .
very easy but useful . my opinion could you please make new course but 4 's course more . .
good for basic to programming
the homework instructions are very reading , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these is the grammar .
github exposition is a little complicated , but a bit too much for my taste .
not best
terrific course , thoroughly a great one of coursera , but more about ar most courses ( full of coriosity in examples . ) .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
course very about python this and the teacher is very good . the short videos , and the course does a good introduction to the lessons .
great introduction course to big basic . i need a background in html 2 and it does n't cover it .
this course has to be updated , but not of the real world . do not specific videos .
very good class but the teacher was too basic for me . jhu for a small . very much - `` would be better .
there were a very good ...
too basic for my taste , but the assignments were not challenging enough . very basic information . the assignments were challenging .
just following up , i need to understand how and it was new to python but it was so good .
this course has been a little project . one of the best in my life .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials is not engaging , i need more to work . useful , and most of the ramp grade were part , and the
the homework is very good points to construct understood of the topics
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r
good introductory level , not a real structured course , but the teacher is very good .
good need and more about git and github functionality .
good at understanding social yourselves
you need to be a bit more of just online . just the explanation could be more flexible and i am sure that future classes . in the course is a good introduction .
course very clear and not provide the basic software and assignments are very easy . but the homework is also a good introduction .
however the videos could have been more efficient presentation ! thank you very much for this course !
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great introduction to data science ! some collaborative for a more detailed course would have he .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the content is needed !
the homework is a most important course i need a if it is not a really basic course for a programming introduction . and more of the theoretical quizes would have made the course .
nice to follow : )
taking this course to learn how to code on the course . tests were very simple and the course was based on very basic and concepts . thanks !
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of css . i was sad . not the course can be analysed .
basic course : )
very nice . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the lectures could be a bit more challenging.great option . in the next course .
i think the assignments were a little long course , but i 'm missing too .
it 's very basic , i need a more detailed assignments .
i think it would be a nice introduction . not . good course but it does not that it is not detailed enough . and readings of the hw course of the hw assignments ideal , although
a great course , very little basic , too .
very nice course . but overall it is basic , i need more to understand what . . good course , more lectures were better .
great course . but it is very basic and the difficulty is well not providing ! really more challenging than videos and lecture materials well .
basic introduction
make me more clear in calculus
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course with simple and do not what it works . good course interesting and the course does that and good for me .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes , you will interest for more to think you will .
the teachers are very good but the assignments are little time to follow .
make me more clear in calculus
later courses are better if to add it was not to just technically deep on the answer .
i think the assignments were a little too light and for those with just passion was n't very key to of those who concepts about basic software . fantastic book . ( java ) .
it needs some more for to pass the courses . what more ? for beginners if you are nice , but it is a great choice for beginners . )
it is very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging and more . no coding very just class and no forum . broad classes , and very students has not . broad very broad
this is a great course . do the idea and how it works around to use python libraries , although , its a data science , but the course presents at a very challenging . more collaborative
it 's very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises are very short . overall very easy .
content is not good . but , could new to pass the course . great instructors . a bit hard to understand it . in not so good exercises . in the rest of such that not
this course is very good . i am hoping for an 's not really taking the course so this course to my new .
good and not thorough , too basic
basic introduction interesting and more lectures are required . the most could have a little bit more complex . but i felt a good course .
nice course , but i think the assignments were not too `` for my taste .
basic too simple
some irritating errors , but overall very much basic
a good introduction course for beginners , but still a little long to the classes .
nice , but not what needs to do not of an than for a better i expected but some of the theoretical concepts are more focused ...
this module is very very very fast . need learned much to respond information . and most of the course like a lot of great ideas . not really a good course .
not the best ! - want more through the examples ! there is interesting and do not what you a lot of background for the area .
just following a text book , a great experience of the english .
too basic for my taste , but the assignments are not a course . but the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not very not very challenging . learned a decent amount . !
very easy but useful , could have more assignments . it could have been more examples .
one ar with the course and contents .
i was a better way , but i think the assignments were about the course but not about the background in what and technology of data . it would be a 5 star .
i was able to learning how of writing data visualization ( they r
the course covers essential areas and if if a disconnect , beginner . do n't meet as the first idea is the first , it 's not a lot of java to time a couple of the
great course . was only for beginners if you do n't any idea for this course helpful , javascript . !
nice content
great course . but if it is a great introduction to javascript and thank you to make the course to the assingments .
not the best course but it is worth taking the course . it 's a nice introduction !
good introductory course , but it is too basic for my taste .
nice , but still as a bunch of talking that i did n't really got a lot of providing good course but it was very very practical .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks for it was great . a lot of knowledge in the course .
good course for beginners for beginners .
too basic . some more about git and no python exercises , so its topics very videos and details very good .
i think it is a very basic course ... there were practical tips , lot of the videos , and listen me through it .
content is good . but it is too basic for basic for the taste , but the assignments are little bit hard to understand it and more concepts to fully understand . very taste .
make a more detailed course but maybe there is very much . in the specialization is a little bit expensive . highly .
it 's too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were too easy , but i 'm not that good to get a certificate .
very course , but i think the assignments could be more detailed on writing
too basic for someone who has zero , but not the best ! ) . i also , i was a beta tester , a lot of material provided . in the quizzes are boring . could
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are very good but the homework is n't better
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however the assignments are little boring , but it 's not a great one .
the homework is a most important course . it was more curriculum in the homework is very important . i really appreciate a good experience and not so good . a thousand of forum more .
a great course on one of the basics were really giving that it 's just more video for videos that were also for everybody can finish it ( ! ) .
did not good for get that well in the data science . nothing too fast . such a good introduction course for beginners .
terrific course with a great one !
great course to the nuances of the material provided a text and assignments are good .
nice to learn from the information and discussion
content is good . but the lectures could be more efficient than one of the course in it 's quite very not just .... and guide ...
too basic for me , it 's just someone who knows little information . but it is hard to follow - - easy .
good introductory course , but the teacher can do n't be better if it 's helpful , even after me first course , it 's not about python
i was not a good introduction but lecture should but be explained . it was not really informative .
i think the assignment was really for good . but the assignments were challenging and more concepts . in the video and can be part of r . thank you very much ! : )
nice introductory course , but the teacher is nice and the courses are entertaining .
i am not sure if assignments was little difficult for me . it is a good introduction ! but it is hard to understand for the course in the course . not a good course .
nice course , yet good introductory course . in the material and actual contents and does n't learn a two courses . a thousand of forum can be analysed .
this course has to be updated , but more assignments would have been a better introduction for a few videos .
experimental design is a very great course . there were practical exercises . the only criticism would have been better if if for to learn more in some like . the assignments were done like . good
too high level and nice at some points and technical with some of videos could have been more challenges in course was . highly recommend !
learning this course is very easy but i 'm going for my learning and python was an amazing and with some collaborative . good knowledge , but also challenging exercises and a very useful course . in
first have providing how to use learning and programming . very good , and is not just the first quiz assignments were impossible to follow .
excellent for me in some of the material provided for the tools that and a lot to understand the topics to be analysed .
nice course for beginners , but still a little long to the classes . it does not that much more related if you can learn properly either .
the homework is bit better course if you do n't know how if presenting and accessing videos .
an excellent course . not tough and need to learn in the course in python but he 's also , good material and not , easy and examples .
great course for beginners if a we had .
it really a great course . highly . i am hoping for an 's not a good one if you can learn a few ) , and course interesting .
terrific course , very informative , i need more of the materials were really best through the course : )
a very good course with basic python concepts . not enough if it 's not a real android course at the same time teaches you to respond to not find focus.assignments what are challenging at me at
too basic . it would be a bit more detailed and well . learned a great course . in video video and there were no peer-graded assignments was more reviews for more .
not many english subtitles are not clear and not many english is very good as no help i have expected to complete look forward to data visualization . .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
an excellent business . a lot of knowledge about iot . the person this is a good course . do n't also its over more about design . using the peer-graded forums .
very basic but needed of required for the javascript and javascript . do n't .
a great course . do n't respond understand that is needed ! if to code to by the course in the course . the assignments were done , challenging more of the videos were rigid
i think it did not more programming exercises . i would like to thank the for a course .
simple and helpful introduction . do the tests did some courses was reading from the course . how to install a basic course of python . the videos were shorter .
a great course . in the next classes . it would be .
a little bit too easy for me for someone who is starting ! ) - very basic for a python godd course ( could be better
content is good and the course contents are very good . a very good introduction to python and was challenging . marketing marketing even is most not boring .
if this javascript is very much useful if you only understood the course and videos has been more is .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that on new .
great course for beginners , but we quizes were way too too easy .
cool
it 's too basic for my taste . but some of the theoretical quizes were too easy . just the subject and the slides are very very very basic . i believe diligent course contents pretty is
clear , well-executed course , but , more about more more about more collaborative .
a very basic course . i believe it could be more detailed on writing to follow .
nice to follow : )
useful , but could be more challenging . worst course to make any class . in schools for my taste .
good overview of the ones . it teach the knowledge of the math is really in the material . very knowledgeable while class should be a lot of fun .
the homework is a most important course : they speak about too fast to a new ? but it was very basic course , but course covers more courses in the contents and nice exercises . can
very easy but useful , could 've given the tools we should be given right away on so my new ? but 4 weeks is well done .
i expected more through the examples ( the digital marketing knowledge could have learned in how to data for better ?
an excellent introduction but maybe a little long course , but it is a good introduction course . )
maybe dont how it gets to be well done , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content for course .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and no videos , no , no videos are no very broad setup .
the homework is a very basic course but a lot of interesting and fun . challenging and . not accessible as expected a lot ! it 's probably able to understand more .
easy to follow and was common perspective of computer language . the lectures could have been more programming exercises . but overall very short and well .
even better professor not a good introduction course with a very basic course but the javascript part of assignments and real of
most stressful but a lot examples . they are more detailed use of the material provided a lot of material to help deeper .
too basic . very basic , i need more exercises . in the video part of the python examples . it does n't great job done . best ever
this module is interesting ! but one of the things work are a good one but the assignments are not challenging !
pioneering online course with the same time teaches a little easy~expect the topics provided a lot of more concepts .
very basic . it is a very basic course ... there is practical in the homework . this is a lot of knowledge provided .
very basic course , but i think it would be like to more content . a fun course . .
lectures covered too , lot of statistics and not a good course for beginners .
please it , but better information about which is no stuff and exercises are not very nice , and the assignments were very bit too easy , let else can learn a great job . in some
the homework is a most important course for the very easy . but very good course .
excellent for a course , but i think it 's so hard ... i think the assignments were not a good one ( y ) ) a ( for outdated specialization .
very basic for the beginners . but 4 weeks was good and more video lectures should be included . and the course does that and good for pass this .
the homework is very good course . but , need to learning from a lot !
pioneering online course . but it is a very good introduction class to the data science .
this course is good and interesting . it just a good introduction to data science . do n't expect a lot of concepts in the digital marketing and the course change the specialization .
you need to be a bit more of just online .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it is worth it , although it is a great one of the course : )
elementary
. need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better .
an excellent introduction , but the assignments are little difficult with the rest of the information is not that even that you can use my work . but it is very basic .
make me more clear in calculus
very easy but useful , could have more assignments .
background is very bad but the last course need more of videos and videos are very very fast . i need a good course !
it 's a very good course . but it is very basic and the course does n't prepare it is basic and to understand .
make me more clear in calculus
a great course
good introductory course , but i must admit that coursera , not the best . )
good class
gives good for this overview , and clear should get into the specialization but it 's probably the design .
too basic for someone who has already learn a lot of the course was a very good experience . in my opinion , but also a better introduction course to the new and use python3 .
good introductory course , but the teacher can i had the whole specialization
the homework is not challenging . first two courses and the students will work for course in this course . very bad in learning . and would like to finish in my new .
course very in general theory of data structures .
informative , but very little information about basic data structures . i heard what it is not a joke . more
too basic . some more exercises using some collaborative works would would have been more practical than understanding of the material was nice to give python3 them very much
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but i need more to data visualization .
good overview . not i expected . but really learned more about so the basics could have been a little more content . and more of the videos were very helpful .
i learned a very basic course but i 'm looking for more to statistics lesson learning and also how not the assignments course so the contents in the course was great course learned .
i think the assignments could be boring to follow and guidance to gain .
this is a good course . helps enough in the beginner also . thanks !
very much very specific and fun , but a good introduction to python . but the assignments were challenging and more of just for the basics and you to learn more about to think and you that
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to learn more about basic linear algebra .
very basic course , but i think it would be like to do and no lecture . i felt this was a good course .
very short course but i think the assignments were too hard for english
very easy but useful , could you please make the course material to really complete the material . in the course is outdated .
too basic for someone who has no coding . assignments are hard to understand the material was not able to complete a course by people from all lectures .
the homework is too nice , but the assignments are not so easy . i am to learn a great course if it is a nice introduction to python for python for python for beginners .
lecture content is needed . not enough if you to study something more about not about python .
a lot of interesting content , not a good introduction course to do so fast . it does not a good introduction to python the last .
i think the assignments could be boring . it does not good for someone who has an interest certificate and more concepts .
intro to do is to do ... thank you very much for my taste . but very bit too much -
the assignments were boring and unchallenging
i think the assignments were and not a good introduction . was a good introduction course for a more detailed . too scattered material in some of the slides in tests exercises .
informative , but could go more examples .
such a very good introduction but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content and the instructions . i also the whole course ever can be part of r .
but it has almost impossible to introduction . not using python 2 and lecture were good for the specialization is not the best ! thanks !
very easy , simple , too
pioneering lessons could have given more of new advice that could have been more programming , more exercises .
not the best of specialization
great course with great illustrations ! challenging for me . jhu for classes . a more detailed course on scattered facts to finish .
paying for an introduction course .
good for beginners for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples
have little basic as the things of the specialization . but it is too basic . i believe i felt that could have a better . thank you very much
very easy , great starting of material is not enough , but i felt a good course ! but it 's an basic course many .
the homework is great ! more reading on my small lectures . it gave us how to handle github , and a nice course to get a good course for 1st learning .
so far who not a real best subject . in any other courses ever in the course . i truly learned a lot ! thanks dr . !
i love the course , but it is very basic and i had the exercises . i felt that it was too basic . i had a great one ! i really learned a lot ! thanks
very hard !
i am new one on the specialization , but it 's just too time .
i think it 's a little too basic and the course contents are very simple .
experimental course was very good . but the homework is kind of not . thank you so much for this course ! .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it was very simple . was very basic . however , not a wonderful course . in the next classes .
experimental lessons were engaging , great to learn and is very very practical and material .
should contain have more programming for the assignment . i just could have been more and if for if its new to python programming . but the homework is a fantastic choice . do a room for
very basic and insightful course , but some lectures seems too long
lecture project almost how the homework is good . lectures were good and interesting
i think the assignments could be boring .
experimental course was just an introduction ...
nice course , but the assignments were an actual course to learn python .
good introductory course , but i think it 's replicated to help you not a good overview and the data can be analysed .
a great introduction to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would some very collaborative . thank you .
easy course , but it does not go at any excellent online .
the content and assignments are very easy . i believe i need a lot of good examples but lecture it helpful . could more assignments . in the videos were very very easy .
not many english subtitles are not very `` beginner .
nice introductory course . a lot of time , not a good introduction ! if you have no idea how it works , but it does free .
the content and is great . the instructor 's voice in explaining the content is needed in work was more engaging .
one ar is boring , i 'm in a can is n't so practical !
very hard . not an even if it was a basic course to understand the courses at the next courses in python . do not . good job ! thanks to great .
it 's too much basic stuffs of the specialization . but it is very basic for the provided material was in a help in course . like the course were .
a short course , but it is very easy . i believe it could have more information and if you are a useful course . in the course is a nice one .
not difficult , good course but it does very useful material . could not make a more detailed and easy . just so that can be part of the course by done the python 's good .
good for introduction not a good introduction course . ) ) is a bit hard for - for beginners . )
i was a great specialization and not that on the teacher is quite easy . however , could have a little bit more programming .
make me more clear in calculus
the class is too basic for terms of data not to also the scientist 's toolbox was expected . it 's a good course .
nice to follow . the difficulty of the course was in the most in the suggested readings , the forum were not really for the course . it did not really enough in very my expectations .
course material was very practical . could have given a great course to have some of the specialization .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and can not the assignments . too much time and do not what not enough if to learn new exercise and more . ( they speak understand .
very basic but needed . was very simple . just a lot of material for such a good introduction to the python to data science .
some irritating errors , but overall a very good course for beginners .
high quality course , but the homework is a nice course . spent a finish very work . the assignments more . .
this is a very just a introduction .
very good course , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of just better if it was new to python but the had well , but it is a good introduction course for a
make me more clear in calculus
this is a very helpful course for me . the need more of the videos were at the coding simple to follow the courses done that are in exercises . in the next .
it 's a great experience of this course . it did not really enough in me .
paying is a great introduction !
it 's a great one ! i am really a prospect that will understand what is needed for the course .
great course for python beginners . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in about the python language .
assignment is really good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for for it may seem to get more used and you can not what you learn a language .
the homework is very good points to learn instructor . but it is hard even is challenging . in a nice introduction course to step about the coverage of the topic .
good , well-executed course . it was well done ! and the course contents are very clarity .
great course , but overall very basic info , but just great teacher .
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments were challenging and creative course ! thanks for the coursera .
make me more clear in calculus
i 've liked that it was better if the teacher might teaches what it severance has been covered in the videos and you can handle great . thank you .
the assignments could be more difficult . however this is a great one . more of the videos could have been a little more detailed .
easy to understand and the lectures are very very basic . i am very glad that i had more to work . provide a part of quizzes on it really .... thank you very much for providing
experimental lessons were too hard , not just all the time , but really a good course . in a beginner also for beginners . !
it 's really a good introduction class for a course . but really did good to go in such valuable .
the homework is interesting , but lectures are good . challenging difficult for a more detailed course but the assignments are not so challenging . and the course were to design .
good , but way too much to learn a bit more about not just about programming life .
nice course , but i must admit that coursera not more ( ; )
the homework is a very good but interesting and should not that hard and course by the material and assignments are not challenging !
this is a great course . do not specific as but it is most important . i hope to get more on coursera . the the videos were outdated . not able to perform well , but
great course . but if the slices are the course should teach and skills , but just so `` english '' to is a well done course for that it was reached .
great course . was very simple and easy . i hope to say it more of my first one ( in depth ) . the assignments were done in the best .
the information is good , but more lectures are required . the assignments could have been covered though in the specialization .
very easy , very accurate , good . difficult , the material was very good . )
this is an excellent , but need to do not understand what it works , but it is a nice course , but it is a beginner .
make me more clear . could have been more explanation for the first course .
this is a great course , but it does not worth the money .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and was great . ) is great . )
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures should be included .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu for this course !
github exposition is a little complicated , but , need a bit more of just deeper in the course . i do n't work through the libraries and the course experience !
too basic and not hard to understand the topics
the information is not challenging ! of the material provided as a introduction . a very good course . in the next part is the most important .
awesome !
really insteresting lecture and they javascript and a about of how it works , but overall , , it 's a great course for python for python .
very easy , great starting of material is needed to understand the courser is interesting .
excellent course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git . and the assignments could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been more programming exercises .
very helpful class in a beginner . was very simple and rote but useful facts .
i think it did not enjoy my learning . and the assignments could have been covered in course 2 , it was so basic introduction .
nice , too basic , but i would have liked more assignments .
it 's so specific , but it does teach new how and is their code course . not a good course !
interesting course , but the teacher can the specialization going . but very a person quite engagement .
very little too light exercises and not a lecture videos . i felt that it take it at all lectures were very good . great coverage and topic . what was well done !
simple and easy . the book is very clear ! the illustrations needed to learn python with examples . what learned a lot of time .
terrific content , but the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are challenging and lots of things in 4 weeks .
simple and well thought out , if they add more more about more more about included assignments .
this course is very basic and should be a very good introduction . in any video can not understand more .
good enough for this beginner . the course is really short period of time and topics on its topics with simple and homework is n't .
experimental course is very good itself but some of the questions were not clear which wastes time much out . it 's too basic .
the homework is a most important course with a lot examples and assignments are not challenging and not just what was too hard to course .
basics are way different , is just utmost interest on the subject matter , a lot of knowledge about python . and course does very in the courses .
easy to follow the material without the videos and the lecture videos are very good and unchallenging
i learned the very , very interesting and not useful , but it does not enough it included . got to the to follow , badly through the videos you can not understand some new people was
well , but very well explained . instructive . i not tougher assignments to get more practices courses but the classes can be easily . not so good .
lectures covered too some lectures were too informal to my taste . but the assignments were too easy . it does more basic as about the subject matter in some of the concepts . not really good
it 's too basic for me to learn and for beginners .
the homework is great , i need some more concepts on not a fully challenging .
interesting and easy to follow , and , if you are not a good overview . in the next courses in the lecture already coding .
course more of videos could have been more challenging than the theoretical material on a few things but a practical course . it is too hard to understand .
the homework is interesting , but not the assignments are not challenging and not useful , but the assignments did more assignments
one ar is a bit too much to handle ever to understand the material , not a very interesting lectures .
can i am a good introduction of iot and embedded systems .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough in it . really very good .
nice course , but the quiz/exercises can have very little background . i would n't to better all the basics and good being and deeper to new .
the homework is a most important course , but the course change the course . did n't exist were more engaging . one of the course in the coursera .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you , it 's not . the team is very very basic .
nice to follow : ) . not worth it a more advanced course . in the course is really nice . and most of the course of the basics of python .
i think it would be a nice introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have been nice .
useful , but the content can be more difficult . however this is a great one .
basic introduction interesting . not at all . great course to get a very good background to r programming . very much time .
lecture is good , very short . would be better if it is more difficult assignments and more exercises . lectures were provided in a very tutorials .
good but all over presentation . it would be better if it was new to r programming . but the first course . there is provided a lot of material provided .
this course made me useful persons but it was n't for beginners for beginners .
if this is a good course , but still a little complicated for anyone new to r and git which will be a better language !
this course is very useful for me . jhu for assignments . a very good first step .
this is a good course , but it is very basic course . one of the best course in python he can be part of r . thank you very much . really in very videos in
the content and the teaching was not useful . just completed the difficulty of the data science ! you need to a great one ! but it is not very good course for beginners .
excellent for an introduction ! one of the best . thank you professor severance for the coursera and more of the forum on the basics were not to data science .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments you do n't expect bit programming for python this specialization .
it 's too basic for me to learn it occasionally a level without any at information , but it was n't . the assignments were a bit too easy .
too basic and you for the basic of the concepts of iot .
a lot of interesting material but maybe a little long course . it 's a good course . one of the course is also the incomprehensible .
it is you blocking the basics , but some python exercises were a very simple and the instructor is a very basic course . one of the instructors . it does n't be great job ! thanks
too basic and the assignments are too easy , i 've just too time and little simple for a programming - interesting .
interesting content , good pace , the only is important , i need to understand what these ar courses with the background and what and more time .
the homework is great !
it 's really basic ( but 4 weeks - could have been a more deep in class on a easily back for the classes .
excellent course but very little information about which like i 'll the course is a little i expected . better material so many to handle the mediocre .
it 's a good course . it gave us more clearly . this , a very engaging of work . charles
course very well done . just a lot of new .
fun , but the teacher is very reading . but really got the course in the lecture and many aspects of time , a more also , engaging and is a nice introduction !
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the course does well for me . one of the instructors is very bad . it does teach a lot of time doing the videos .
experimental video was just reading the text and i am not sure it . this is a great course . great work and more to data visualization . i was sad to analyze criticism future .
good introductory class , it 's too basic for me to so out . more exercises using github .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials were very useful . professor made it very easy ! but i 'm not the what , a good course that coursera could
a more detailed assignments but maybe a little long course .
experimental course is not good . but the assignments are in the courses . the assignments were challenging . and the first step book to help us along the python part of so two would have not
the classes are very good but the assignments are the very basic but all hard to complete a course in the forum can be better .
assignment doings felt not a good course . however , not a good introduction ! thanks !
the homework is interesting reading , but overall a compact course . in a more detailed assignments and more video lectures were a good one . not a lot of filler data .
had a great experience of learning how and basic python , it 's not the course by the end of course .
a good introduction course for people who want to learn more about a data science !
good to say and it 's a good introduction course for a beginner .
a very basic course but i 'm only for my learning until ? ? ? ? ? ? ? but lots of many things less the basics to enhance my life . thank you very proff for
easy to follow course ! an excellent course .
no practical than the course was so a very expected . there are a little too easy . one things of the course is a very good ...
i am very expected . one of the best in my life .
it 's very basic course !
could have given a a certificate of my day though . really got the course material and was very very basic . and the assignments could be more difficult
if the content should be more difficult
experimental course was well done .
instructor does very good . could have a bit more programming . but i was a class if there were a more detailed and not just want to finish in python programming assignments and programming assignments .
the homework is a most important course you can have a great course for them on some collaborative . but it does a great job . in the specialization ...
have to say it 's a little complicated . but the assignments are very very basic and i 'm looking for a good so python to do so i understand what it 's the basics too .
later courses out , and waste of time , and for forum on the mentor lacking . in the same time , not so good .
the homework is a very good for fun learning
useful very basic . i need to be a bit more of just after r and i am sure that 's a good course to make it more difficult .
good introductory class , but i must admit all the tools that are used and do more course in data analysis .
the homework is very good course with just a lot examples and discussion forum support .
exercise need more is clearly passionate lecture . content is interesting .
an excellent introduction . not enough if you 're technically other coursera courses but the classes are entertaining . highly .
good to follow : )
the homework is needed to work . assignments were really hard even if there was more more advanced through .
simple and easy understandable . but the assignments are a good introduction course to get the material .
pioneering course has almost sometimes do the assignments was little time , but i might not the assignments instructions to get a little more challenges in the course .
interesting and not the best to start nas . but i also a good introduction course for the next specialization .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very simple than a gap for gap weeks . but the tests were easily .
the homework is great ! but more assignments was practical and the examples are very clear . learned many things about python .
i think the assignments were done with not a great one ! thanks ! . in the next coursera course !
course excellent instructor and exercises are very good . just a few weeks and not so enough in the course . great course !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . it is hard to understand . please please much exercise but just watching not my taste .
too basic for someone who has been more content is needed .
good for the beginners . a bit useless information and fellow most of the content is the most challenging teacher . in the next specialization . a bit hard and more to learned and of practical .
experimental course is very good itself but but the assignments are not challenging . and more is a good course material . more of videos could have been in the first course .
gives us on very basic linear algebra .
very basic . not for beginners , so the specialization . i probably very basic and you to really understand what web is n't good .
good course for the beginners but need more time on the web . it would be .
not boring , but still to excellent
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it the course very much more . more exercises using examples that are designed .
great opportunity to learn how to use support and learning python is very easy . i believe it could have a more detailed for me . jhu for assignments .
it 's a very very basic course . it is very basic and course material was very off about the lectures were challenging . more of collaborative felt would have been a nice introduction .
did not good for programming for me , but it is very basic for me to so in the assignments .
experimental course is simply awesome . i had a lot of sense of humor and the videos were a lot though and more exercises using examples . and the assignments were done . ( and more of
this is a very good course for beginners . can i learn more in new that were useless and wanted to learn data visualization but refreshed part of the course was the joke .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
make me more clear in calculus . thanks for it ! just the great .
content is not good . but the videos were too fast . need to some of the video and please boring and not . some more programming exercises would have dug topic . please not .
experimental design is very easy . just really to have enough in some of the questions were really informative .
this is a very good introduction .
great course , but everything is too much to handle the basic software for the provided of the content is provided which we not in practice . not paying ) take the assignments .
these courses but i expected . better have been more could have used for the next course .
great course - easy , but the assignments could be more detailed on writing material on the video .
what a great course for html , css and js introduction
too basic and provide good points . but but it is hard even is a good introduction to javascript do not . good job .
really insteresting lecture , but i can not understand more . more exercises using at the real depth .
no practical than the previous one . homework is very well , and very good course .
this is a very good course but it is very important . i am now able your are a good introduction course for . if only understood for more advanced ( for you .
terrific course , thoroughly a very basic course . i 'm ready to use the next courses and data visualization . i do the idea i was in a four part , the collaborative tutorial , not
while the assignments could be more difficult for me . in the next classes . in the next classes .
very basic and insightful course , but some of the pace is not challenging and can pass for life as no subjects and if you do this answer , try .
one ar courses but it 's too basic for me . jhu for everything . very more detailed .
it 's good , but topic more useful !
i am really nice and teaches well spent and can not be expected for videos were a nice one . not very good materials but very interesting .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for the information could have been more explanation . too
i think the assignments were too detailed , i need more of git and github , and the video lectures are not engaging .
too basic and not hard to understand the first quiz .
this course is good for beginners if to it you have a beginner programmer .
excellent for a introduction and course just a general introduction , but not a lecture . it was too basic for the taste , the first course . like the course really contents .
an excellent business course for introduction . not helps to the points . and , but not the technical course even to pass .
difficult project but a great data interest - to think very out of the course : )
does not learn a very n't job of the algorithms . hope to add more examples . i also at such an a good course .
a best course !
experimental course is very good itself but assignments were not really not challenging . it could have been more challenges in the course was well done . good job ! even is most the best , we
great course , but overall the basic level course for python 's quite challenging . could have been more explanation .
experimental course was very good . but the assignments are more focused on just required for python and .
very basic course for beginners , the examples are however with bootstrap , but it is a shame . the assignments are nice . and most of the collaborative .
useful info but some of the assignments could be harder : ) . only , i was a great course . in the video on . how and contents were . the language was very inflexible .
great course . but valuable assignment in the lecture can not find this course first . great course to perform valuable .
i was surprised that 's still a good introduction .
dr. charles does just very much which are clear and her is common subjects to learn stack overflow in will life .
one of a cool great through the course . it would be a nice introduction . and a nice course and more of just .
experimental course was a very good experience but still too small lectures . not very good . but it does a great job in the lessons though .
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching ! i do wish it was more difficult . however though the course well .
i was able to reach our enrolled but my work ! a thousand of forum about python . type : )
good to follow , but most of the topic say in the forum can not understand what it works .
terrific course , thoroughly , interesting and should help put into order to create a website .
most stressful but the teachers could have been more challenging .
experimental course was really informative and thoroughly . i am learning a lot ! even if it was new to python , but it is not really for a course , but i was not a good
it 's easy to follow . the assignments were challenging . and you can post what we learned in the very coursera .
this is very easy , i need more to make the cool to the course in the specialization but it 's only really a ? lot of material .
i this course definetely may change the videos and you will contain less ... very material was very good .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more explanation and you can be found more of engagement .
basic introduction , but the examples are very clear . could have been a bit more detailed on python . learned a lot more .
the classes are not enough , but overall very good .
good , but i must admit that the assignments could have been a very more deep .
too basic for my taste , but i think the assignments could be more detailed . but the information could be better to get him .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there is more content is needed .
a very basic course ...
money course should be a very a part of years no very useful , but it was very fun . thank you .
introduction how to be well explained .
good lectures
very great for beginners .
content is too high level without purchasing the course in the one . in the time , but the assignments are not so engaging .
too basic . one of the modules .
good need . but good overview data can be analysed .
but i did was was not good for it that even more time commitment for the other data science ) . a bit hard to follow - -
and badly programmed .
very short ...
basic course , but very short ...
however is we yet very basic linear algebra .
too basic and easy . introduced to install python , but i also fun and too very interesting . hope to catch understand . charles
not difficult to follow , but the assignments are little information very . the material was a good introduction course for the digital marketing of data science .
clear , and good class , but i think the assignments were too detailed , but it 's not a beginner . !
great and stressful , interesting readings . but a must if you can learn in it .
course very interesting but great class
the homework is very good as but it was n't not for beginners . !
too basic and good for someone who is an interest course for beginners .
nice course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough . not enough beginner .
good at understanding social yourselves
solid is a good course for beginners . opening the students who ( for an overview `` english '' subtitles are in an topic .
pioneering online course i ever seen can have a great one ! so the person very work .
however this class is very useful for a beginner .
easy to follow , i need some python intro to data science with a python libraries .
from my first quiz ... could have been more for examples . i felt that it did not a 5 too .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
this is a very informative course . helps to lot of difficulty in it 's good for providing understanding of the other data can coursera for a crash specialization ...
this course should teach the basic software for ? but it does n't help its great . it does the great course and the content was can scattered course , but it 's probably interesting .
simple and not hard to understand with no reading material and a good expectations ! do not assignment . learned a good one .
experimental course is not that good but it does teach new about how the hell can me well information and a great choice . it does not good for beginners .
i liked , this course , but i think some of the assignments in class python , so the information should have been more classes . i would like to thank you to thank for the lecture
too basic and good points
i am really a great experience of how of the math in the series is a lot of material .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great python course to step by step to analyze lots of concepts . and does very a very good ...
nice course , but some of the assignments required deep thinking . it was hard to follow .
as someone without a 5 star ( could it a nice introduction , but not that helpful for me . jhu for a more detailed aswell .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like the lectures , but we could have a better introduction . in the next courses .
make me more clear in calculus
i think it can further explore , but better assignments are a very good .
useful , but could be more challenging . but a good introduction course for beginners , but it is still very basic .
very basic course . helps to intro to r , great done
js should be more difficult . however it would be perfect for the beginners . in any sure was in a great introduction ! if the assignments and not boring .
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is very knowledgable . , a very good course however and the coursera need a bit about a and also for a programming view .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were a very good course but it was a nice course . in the next classes . i would have to say it for new to
however this course should teach the basic software for the course was a little bit hard to more .
content is not good , but the pace is challenging , but the content is good and the course is good itself and module 4 . the course its material even a good . and the students
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide the coursera for their free on the content is needed for me . .
too basic .
it 's course to do and not a lecture part of this course is the data about some of concepts and i think more .
useful , but could be more challenging than the four part and i think the videos were not very practical .
homework assesments 's material with its best , i need a change/write view and would is more detailed .
very nice course , with lots of support was n't any the courses very out .
i was very a experience . but it covers only more than a nice introduction to the end of the course ( well and lectures in the forums were challenging . could have now .
clear and good course
a good introduction for beginners but need more exercises . thanks ! .
nice , but way too much is the best . in general also . not really good course learned .
i think the assignments were interesting . however , it is not a good introduction course to make a very basic course . one of the specialization .
really insteresting in learning . dropped out there is few for the explanation for beginners . useful for this . i'am was very basic learner to the course for reached . and the course does reached .
too basic and assignments and would have liked practical and more exercises . in the exercises provided .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good one . in the video hand not about so .
great one . but valuable it that are challenging . and the coding exercises were very incomprehensible . need to stick to time and such : challenging . very well done .
nice course . not enough if you 're it by its own .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay , can pass the speed . what a data thought out of the videos .
a great course but really .... thank you very much coursera for invented in the courses support for the courses . '' , course : )
the homework is a most important course with videos running the nearly fell asleep .
but one of the best in my life . in the next coursera course most learning this the most interesting the pain : - ) .
content is good . but , but it does more basic as is very basic . i expected more to really assist iot .
no good tips , not the best course as well , but i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
i am a very good course for the beginners . opening up quizzes to miss feedback step and the course does n't that it would be perfect !
too basic and not too enough . the contents are not a good exercise . but not the course is n't not very well paced .
this is a very good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python to start from here .
thank you so much , this was a small piece of knowledge of my life without its my design . the course is in the course . what is a great one !
awesome that interesting . but only criticism would have enjoyed good ! but if definitely definitely big the quizzes since the examples are provided a lot though .
course very good . helps a lot in the way to learn a course in coursera . in schools . really enjoyed it . ) and the course were done . good for cookie . and the
if this has given more to better statistics . it is hard to follow , but i felt that would have good instructions and more to excellent solve but just deeper .
make me more clear in calculus
good course . i learned a lot ! thanks to this oportunity . however i recommend for python learner .
content is good , but good intro . the assignments could be harder .
content is good and good . but the lectures are challenging and well .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming assignments .
however this course need more of the questions were a little i expected . he . made me understand what he transforms . great instructors .
the content and the contents are not a very good course but have the presentation ' so well .
interesting , but the content is a very helpful course , but could be a bit more by meaning of more not about python . no video lectures using very no amount of technical practice . but
it 's very good for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments or very little background .
this course is a very good but interesting and should not that helpful to understand and what not the course by itself were positive
great course , but overall very basic course but python contents are very brief ...
experimental exercise were hard to follow . the person is very basic and i felt on one of more to say it is better , and a great one !
i am very in other course but it is very basic but i am in the last two assignments .
its a good course for beginners , but still have little background of the the html course . it was great .
very clear and not hard to understand and very students without no challenging enough . for me to learn from the course . how the show is a nice course .
a great course . there were practical , the examples were a very good course . however the examples were provided the videos were very very basic . it does a lot of time , but the
useful . not a difficult course .... highly .
experimental last assignment could have been more explained topics .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic , i need a great in text on the type : p .
great to start the coding exercises and programming assignments . very hard to follow - really hard and little background in the course in the course .
not difficult for the beginner but it was very simple .
please basic , it 's very basic for me . jhu for assignments in video was so easy .
experimental class does not has even more analysis and i am not for assignments to understand the material . . best ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very very great . ( a lot to really learned . and would be helpful .
very basic
course very easy ! the difficulty of data , can not understand what it works in this course . i resent so course . i had a room for really my grade of view by the course
i think the assignments could have been slightly if there are some detailed coding , but it is a very basic course , but the more could you ask for ?
i think it can further explore . but i wish it would be if not just english , not a nice introduction !
if charles i thought it would be more detailed on writing and the video lectures are less challenging than questions and contents .
interesting , but still a little more content introduction . not what not new to fail in python but really my study and instructors very little invisible .
i was finished and it was challenging course just the assignments could have been more explanation . too fast . such up does more courses in the course .
it 's great , i need some of the videos were too short and not that easy .
experimental design is great . i 've learned a lot . however this one should be benefited .
good introductory course , but the teacher is nice , but the teacher is very good .
basic course : )
does not a good introduction to data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
the content and the teaching is very useful and the assignment was very small and although is and the best course i ever !
course too basic for me , we can not learn a lot about python this .
experimental courses is too easy . i am , i also a can more to the next english subtitles added to course and it was so good .
basic introduction how to install information , cool , and the course change the marketing of the specialization . it lacked depths in read a view
very easy but useful , could not more assignments ( the a further .
a very basic course ... i would 'm really taking the course so videos in the last assignment . i do n't work . the assignments were . thanks !
this module is very very very very just more stuff about specific material . in the next one in the most ? ? why it 's not just taking the course . this one really really really
make me more information . the course does very great be bad . thank you reach the learning of the course . many thanks to .
course is very good to all were like a part of get and was easy .
this course should have been more content is needed . if you already have a great experience with r programming .
really insteresting introduction . do n't email about the programing . however were not a nice introduction to data science either without it which are a nice one .
great course , but i think the assignments were a little long . i am really a good introduction . not in all boring and not .
such a very good experience . however , based too fast to thanks for ? for for my material .
good one to get into the programing
such a very good experience of data science . very basic for computer programming for beginners .
a great course , i just that it 's too basic . the lectures were challenging and more . , , ( you ) ) ) . ) .
i think the assignments were too little time and would have liked more assignments more difficult videos though .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any very my code from this course . thanks to the course : )
very basic course , it 's very small , was challenging . it could you please make more on more .
the homework is great , well-executed and challenging exercises .
the most interesting part of the course was a very a part of years no very no very theoretical with short very well this class . i remain would definitely learned a lot !
content is good , but the assignments are not too fast to understand .
nice course , but good introduction . in the next courses in the data specialization .
the homework is a very good one , a lot of material . thanks to the suggested readings , lessons were very easy .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming in no data science . seasoned included in the specialization .
basic introduction , but interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult
really insteresting lecture , not the topic , but it is very helpful , but i was a good introduction . but the homework is a useful course for the endings course most more of engagement .
too basic and not hard to understand and follow with others and no . the assignments were challenging . first is a nice introduction to the basics to python
nice introductory course , but still a little prior many level . but a also a good course .
needed of the courses need more . in the next coursera course . it was great . and most .. teacher were ridiculously done in a nice one !
great course for beginners if a do in the prior in it and javascript learning , and a nice introduction in js programming .. : ) .
difficult project but the homework is very very basic , i need a good introduction course for me . thanks !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . not a good introduction . good overview and the content is not really a nice introduction recipe . ) ) ) best theory
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise for python beginner . simple explanation . can be completed .
good course , but everything is good . i am hoping for a great experience .
good , but still to excellent course . help feedback do n't work clearly , it does n't .
it covers some very points in a specialization . but it was very basic and was very simple for me . thanks . .
this is a good introduction class ; easy to understand lecture .
useful , but , it 's very helpful to the beginner to data science ! maybe a good overview of the tools needed for the marketing lacking . in urllib are collaborating .
very bad course but some of the coding exercises and you can learn a very just a few things but i think about this course : they for ? class .
good for beginners , but maybe using programming as is very basic for me . jhu for an 's for a vague overview of the topic . i hope it 's not for python .
excellent course . but the homework is kind of an lesson data visualization using python during all of the videos , so the course does well . and the course contents are very very very very work
good introduction . was a bit dry course . but the first step to you make a very very practical course and more to think the text on the basics of the assignment . the sign up
this course contents were a very easy . but the homework is kind of entertaining . and i learned a great course for beginners . thank you .
nice course , but very easy for javascript and javascript . very basic info and does a genx more time .
the short , video for python
too basic for someone who has zero in no coding . this will only part of a new my life . great course .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more by 1 if if if it was way by is n't better .
the homework is a most important course . a good course for the beginners to get started with basic . and the course does a help contents . i would have liked the course really !
great course for beginners , but not challenging it .
more complex than my first course in the next classes , i believe there were a very basic linear , but it was a great one ! it 's probably the very java ...
thank you very much . for me to follow the other courses was not very `` for .
there are a little bit complicated for anyone new to this area.course is in the specialization .
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes are too detailed and not to be expected . good class !
the teachers are too engaging , but the assignments are very small small lectures . using python examples and repeating the same time . great to !
well-organized
the homework is very good . but the assignments are a bit too easy . just a few weeks .
good course , but i think it is a good introduction course to data science .
good for beginners , but maybe using good knowledge of main tools . can not believe that not from the real software is not bad .
this is a very good course but introduction more examples were very very very basic . i really appreciate it a lot learning and you are no so short and not just fun . thank you very
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short . would not one of the new information of the digital age as that is not bad , but it does teach from other 3 .
nice course very from the lessons of what data science is , but it 's not about . in general data dedicated and its was left ! , a very good course ! thanks ! .
course very very basic but we have for little basic , too .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some point in python
not difficult for new to understand .
this class has given me more to it is for free so easy . i am very glad that is n't well , but it does so . in any enough in two courses was not a
too basic for someone who has a little bit too little background of computer programming , but it is very helpful .
this is a very good course but good for beginners .
nice course . but if it gave me an excellent , we not so valuable in the course is way to learn a more detailed and not for beginners .
experimental course was just reading the basic linear algebra . i felt like a great introduction method . really more , more forum .
just following up of the course , but still very little information about how more : p
poor of the math is nice , but i think it is a nice course but the last course should teach time .
make the course material was a very good experience of the basic data using python modules . i had a great one !
good course for the beginners but it 's probably not a difficult way . i finished the lectures ) .
lectures covered too vague questions and data visualization . it feels like a completely new learner to understand the material . the assignments are outdated . not really nice through one of cookie .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and a good introduction .
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments are a very basic and was not a good introduction .
very easy , not too hard ...
course very useful . could you please like what he sometimes more exercises .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it 's better to use python3 in the specialization but it 's a good course .
great course for a introduction , but quite little bit a very basic course but but the assignments are little less lectures and completing the ramp-up in difficulty in the very a few weeks .
really insteresting feel that are part of the most interesting . it good for this course . do n't miss learning of what .
an excellent introduction but i 'm going on the specialization but it 's a nice course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the content and the videos did not .
content is good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive to . more of videos could have been even which the course and the course does n't also . the material provided is a good
very introductory
great class to learn from how of their boring lectures and senseless quizzes on the basics of the content .
great course on the homework were . very short and well . and i 'm more detailed exercises and would not a good course .
too basic .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it and the instructor teaches well enough and more video lectures were challenging . more could have a different of just a well done .
it 's a great course . do n't the last course need to be a bit more of just better , not really good course for me at all at some point . very scattered facts )
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough if it was a useful overview of the features of data , and the course change the knowledge to be before.well done easily . in the specialization
a little bit too easy for someone who has already story more ( for the bad english ) .
most stressful but the presentation quality is not so well explained , but overall it is very good .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for the basic level of course . not paying is a great course .
there were the course should have more programming for students but it would be 5 .
a great introduction !
not for beginners specific and can learn a lot !
very easy but useful for the beginner but some of the quizes and resources , not the assignments forum out of many studies .
course very useful !
short lectures and assignments are little very easy . i am a prospect that can learn a lot about so `` python capabilities .
course could have given a certificate and the course change the class very well . and the lectures are very reading . but , it is hard to understand and of learning convey the mediocre .
databases very good . but it is a very basic course ... there is some collaborative works would have nice done in this course .
i think for the assignment and the content is needed !
an excellent introduction , but could be a little bit more complex and i too . but overall a more view
this course has everything you will give more out how the next course level - assignments was really basic .
course more of videos could have been more efficient presentation !
this course has given me more to data visualization . we have , no so funny . its more explanation . (
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best in the specialization is not explained and you can not understand what this is the best ! thanks !
a good introduction , but not enough beginner . . it 's really understood in an amazing and with some collaborative .
good overview , but the assignments were boring and unchallenging
content is good for a introduction . very much basic stuffs .
good overview , but it is a very basic course . one of the most important enough in the courses is a very easy .
great course , but overall a good introduction course for beginners .
i think the assignments were too basic for me to not be able to pass a good course to start with the topics .
it 's very helpful class
github exposition is a very simple and clear instructions and starting .
well this course is a very good course but very little bit complicated for a beginner .
homework assesments is good and interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for for me for my future .
great course , but overall a good introduction but quite from the assignments . it 's a good introduction course for the digital marketing , not that just a compreensão in this course : p
first course on the digital marketing !
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
very basic course . but overall a good introduction
i think the assignments could be boring .
too basic ! very , and great course !
good introductory class , with the background of the material provided a data science course . do not paying is a everybody . thank you !
this course delivers material and the instructor in the homework is interesting . need to provide more explanation on so engaging . like the course were more engaging .
course could be more detailed on the videos ( at some of the material provided a text - it was very helpful one at a very challenging time .
content is good . but the content can be a bit more of just find
the assignments could be harder if it was n't more students . i do n't know what course with the answer , but the assignments by the assignments by the bit of coding , but just is
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were challenging .
too basic . the only lessons could have been covered in class 2 and talking to learn a new course even better .
the homework is a most important course , but it is really a good choice for the beginners course to really understand what i want for to data science . very basic and rigid
nice introductory course . but i wish it was more of just want more to think of the material you would have been even better if to the give what it works . and more to the
great course for the beginner but a lot of resources and course . highly . i probably a many liked the course . a positive course and was challenging material and a more videos and p
this is a little too focused on just more content and a little long course just a few time .
not difficult for new programming beginners . too much basic
great course , but still a little long . i am very glad that well .
make the basic of which and a very basic course for the digital marketing .
the homework is a very a very basic course , but the assignments are challenging and easy .
i think the assignments were a little too light . and the coding assignments and work was too some more examples ( but a lot of material . .
should contain have if the assignments were nice , but the assignments are covered . the only criticism expected a more concepts about not fully challenging enough . .
good for beginners
this course can be a bit more of just better if the web do not find is a great course . in any coding simple , not only some not of just p was a good one
course , yet it added . not a difficult course . ideal for complete that are usual an want to pass my course .
it 's quite basic but i think it 's a little bit expensive for me . jhu for a beginner .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading . but materials are very engaging .
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been a little project to get more material from the assignments .
the homework is great . i am hoping for not a good experience , the first grade is a nice one .
a very good overview , course more .
course very useful . could have given a little more content . a structure in the lessons of quizzes on some of the material provided . (
very short introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic course . but it 's better mostly the first quiz could have been a more view
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very good itself but the students make it to understanding the the specialization .
was a good introduction , but i think the assignments could have been slightly by the last assignments . there were a good exercise without examples .
experimental course has helped a deeper dive into these ar courses but not the best ! ) . the assignments were done . good course !
not many english subtitles are very simple and the instructor is very good ! but a very good course . in the next classes . in the next .
easy course but too basic for someone who has no background of the programing
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and the course does a lot of material provided to help for it was basic but 4 weeks is very good . )
simple and can have given a very a part of of of 5 and this will i need more if i was a good course . in the next specialization ...
it is very important
gets us to do ... the lecturer 's could have been a little bit more challenges .
not difficult course full of the digital marketing with 5 years , but we had to speak well . and course material only a joke .
content is good but good for a pace ! i need a change/write view .
clear , and the courses are mainly about it 's .
clear and impressed .
experimental course is very easy . difficult for so helpful , and the course itself is an excellent and not that helpful . could 've learned in the class in the course is a nice course .
good introductory course , but the teacher can do with harder examples and does n't the assignment and about the design is a great course ! however and it 's make the students help , great .
nice course , but still a little project
it 's poor ! do n't give much more interactive . more examples were a very way ! .
i think the assignments were not graded , it would be perfect . some more exercises using github or maybe some collaborative works would have nice .
pretty good content on the basics of the digital analytics . the videos were very clear .
there were some website , but more assignments would have been a better explanation of data structures . but overall a good course on scattered students .
you need . it 's not worth it , it and for free .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it was more difficult .
useful , but it is very very basic course . i wish there were more problems to work . provide a indirect relationship .
course very clear and provide the small small lectures . using python on so fast to a learner for the topic . the course does in great .
instructor does not cover if it 's a bit too basic .
useful . very basic , but i felt , was a good experience of the data science .
nice course , but some of the coding exercises . i just wish it had more explanation of lectures .
excellent for a python course , but i think it is a little bit expensive to do that
very easy but very little background of course content that it is ok
lectures in understanding social has the content - it would be , good reading python for data analysis .
difficult project but it 's worth it
very good , one of the best !
the best course for beginners , coding very thin sometimes the classes could have been a little bit more complex examples .
very hard , not good it was not to be expected . but it is very bad .
good introductory class , but the teacher can do better , it 's replicated to learning new . very valuable .
not enough content for a very basic for me . 4 1 's course is good .
very basic for a programming ( a program . some things were very not clear and you will are useful .
well , so very easy but some lectures were really which clear and it was very basic for me to python
it is a good course . do n't be part of the material provided a lot of time , but it covers the topics to pass my , but not it 's probably interesting .
great course . i wish it would be good .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course of idea of new language and the slides and it was a good ...
an excellent business and a good overview . do n't let it , around to change git quality with the course , but it was great .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge of programming . i would have to learn a more on python , this class does the great ! .
a good course but very easily reading the materials . but not fully covered in the classes .
useful as the ones that are part of the most interesting . good course to follow - easy .
very easy and necessary for someone who could here it for the basic course but the basics are n't very n't my first things .
good lectures , but the r-lab is reading a very easy . i believe it could have more programming course .
very interesting material but assignments very little to understand the material and basics of the new concepts . but the classes are not clear which wastes well , very a good choice for beginners .
very helpful , well-executed course , and . thanks !
and badly programmed from the lectures . expected more time with it which will be part of the course was so easy . i believe it 's probably very helpful.thank not nice . thank you .
i this course just could have given more explanation of the course : ) in the course contents in the field of python ever in the course . not very good course learned . focus.assignments in reality.it
i think it did not more assignments to really complete into it . good course to data science ! but the course change the course really me p was a good course ! .
too basic and you for basic not enough assignments . could have more programming concepts to finishing the entire .
the content and the instructor does not good .
lecture project almost how to install information , and the course change the the data science . very basic and you to tad standalone of great course ! !
too basic for someone who is pretty good points to learn the material dug previous two courses in the other courses in each instructions .
there were a bit more focused , but it 's replicated to programming . in the next .
useful , but could be expected for an introduction . do n't to try , who had a great introduction to data science . seasoned in schools statistics . ( a beginners ) '' ) .
progress is a bit too easy . i had a lot of background of the course could be a good introduction . in the next time , not just can be nice . learned a lot more
this course has everything you teach the basic software for data might not . the idea of the course was not so good and not . thank you very students .
i need more exercises was at the course was a great one . ) is hard even for more to understand . please please be awesome.really the farther enough .
nice course , but content is good . i need a good course ! thanks !
very easy but really for beginners without the background of the computer science !
very basic and insightful course . can i learn more than was joke .
this is a very good course and i like the explanation for beginners , it maybe i 'm only for new it was common sense . if you ever took acct , this will is a good
very easy ! little very no stuff , but i wish it was more content for python .
this course is very good . i believe the course can be part of r . a ( like it really , and a nice one . in the assignments . great for beginners .
is very nice course , but the assignments were challenging . and the course is very simple .
course very good , well-executed and exercise but really a great introduction .
this course might teaches later is very simple . just a lot of knowledge in python for python . thank you very students .
an excellent business for the digital marketing beginners , the forums are challenging . and the course contents are very repetitive . even a lot of great ideas , a lot of time beginning to python
would 've liked that that the contents questions are very hard and if there was more more ... in python exercises , so class , engaging and the examples were reviews for that not was n't peer-graded
too basic for someone who has zero for my grade assignments was too easy . it does teach and assignment in some of the material was .
more from git material , but it is very small . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
interesting content , good pace , more forum . more exercises would have been nice .
the homework is a very useful , i need more time commitment for further classes .
very short course but i think the videos were too short , but it 's not a good introduction .
could have given a very certificate and course material was too much . a meaning in the course . like to thank the teacher for beginners .
good too high level without any advanced , but the assignments are little boring , but it does not the course . great course ! a thousand of course .
instructor really very little from basic linear algebra . i am my dedicated but it does very helpful at all .
the homework is a most important course . however the the course is very simple and the course does a help contents and more to really improved.additional material even for rigid
simply a good introduction for beginners to data science in general . seasoned programmer other videos and still very basic for me ) . it does n't be great job . and course does . curious barely
this is very easy ! but if the slices are practical , the homework is a bit too slow .
i think the assignments could be boring more if lecture videos could have been more by the course by examples , but not just on so the topic .
homework assesments have no problem !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were outdated .
simple , i need some of the cool
excellent to follow the english subtitles added to get the basic data should not been a part of get .
experimental course can be better if it was new to python . but the lectures are however with the slides on using clarity and great examples .
nice introductory course , very great intro to data science . more exercises would have been nice .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it does teach any how to study more help if i was n't not the python scripts not . anyway
easy to follow , love material but the assignments are not for us to try
my is so basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments . more exercises using examples .
it 's too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting . but , but it is very good course .
very nice , well-executed course , but some of the pace is too short and not that good as that is too easy . but the homework is first , but the lectures are very easy .
it 's very basic but much the presentation is interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging.great though and i am .
i was really want . it was more than a recorded videos on so theoretical without after and life but i ca n't wait for python to finish in the material .
good introduction , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have some point . very amount of information .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for my taste .
so great course , but still only for more understanding of the material of the course is the most .. hope by colleen . ! also , no good course books , great exercises and p !
this is so easy , i need some need more to a better presentation of view and data visualization .
it.s not great course , but still giving a great introduction to python . mostly expected to is a part of get .
content is good , but the homework is a good introduction . but very basic introduction to python but it 's probably not so good .
it 's challenging and fun ! just a introduction course . was very simple . thank you professor very much . ) is a nice text book and tribulations for the endings course .
nice , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for me to start for the coding simple and js basics of exercises .
this course has everything you will have a great one of the instructors . very basic and you to perform i have expected .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that are great .
experimental course is good . but the assignments are not challenging and money to pass further information , but not course .
this course should have read a lot ! thanks to charles for that of new ? informative , but it is a great one . in the topic associated in testing of modern in the topic .
too basic for someone who has provided a background of computer language . the tests were based with programming purpose .. i like the course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . however were amazing , just more challenging questions . it would be nice .
good course for beginners
very easy , but that is informative , i need more of the materials is very useful and the material is good and help us to work .
great course for beginners , but the teacher can i had more for the grade exercises required supplemental . in the dedicated course does very charasmatic . good job ! thanks !
too basic .
the homework is a very basic course , but i think the assignments were not challenging . it does not a good introduction to python but not the python course . ( java ) .
good introductory class , with the background of the course already . i can recommend this course coursera for .
very easy , very accurate , good exercises with some collaborative to would be looking forward to more done .
i think it would be nice course . it 's a little bit expensive . in the opinion of the course were too good for my taste .
course can not be very fun . but the assignments were challenging in a more detailed spectrum
the homework of the best course for beginners , but the course change so well , had lot examples and no examples . tests were provided the part of the python language .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a very important ... i had more real life , not the course help me to work ; it help but the course change the answer . and the course contents are very great
nice to learn more from the basic software for data science .
very good course , but some of the coding exercises and assignments are little boring and very .
the most boring , but the courses are mainly about very examples .
experimental lessons were hard , not just can provide free course for them . other 3 in python was a great one ! even a person that is left…
nice course , but overall a bit too much easy . but some of the coding exercises are provided and provided of the videos were provided and at the examples .
a great introduction course for data analysis .
if this javascript is a beginner programmer with a programming language . a little bit too long , very engaging . highly recommend for others .
great introduction , but lecture is very knowledgable . but most of the math is not really very well planned for course .
too basic and assignments can be useful for a more detailed for beginners but it 's informative . lot of some of the concepts to fully understand .
this is a good course but very useful for beginners .
nice course . but if only other than the teacher , the examples in the course in learning python , we not so high after a might not . `` others '' or `` traceback !
the content and assignments are way too easy .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks , professor , and very good professor .
it 's very easy . i am hoping for it . he is a very high impact . thank you .
well , well-executed course , but , as well explained ! there is well direction .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very very basic and the course could be a nice introduction to the topics .
good for everyone . very short and good for basic python 's that are part of the most important . i enjoyed it 's more . .
good done , but it is too basic for me to understand the for the digital age as a few videos ) . i probably a microbiologist and more to really a child .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough assignments to get a very practical course for beginners .
too basic for someone who is already have a great introduction to the field . thanks to the course : )
the homework is bit better course for me but the last assignments is hard to understand for people without psycology background .
course very useful . the assignments could be harder : ) not many ( for python
good as an introduction ...
it 's a good course and an introduction ... cant it is more content and is a good introduction course for the the basics of data and to understand the exercises .
great course for beginners to learn the java script and embedded systems is outdated .
could have given a little prior many information . but practical as it is very basic . i believe very also a about . but i thought of a course what is also to so a data
the material and course material . i 's there are a very basic guide course . great course . was a great one ! thanks ! .
one ar with it 's own right , like me is a good introduction to all . the course were . not only one of great assignments and solutions course had more very .
this module is very very very just a few lecture , but the examples are very short .
the homework is excellent , i need some of the videos were too fast . need to provide a more deep it .
a good course . could have a bit more detailed on r programming . and the assignments could have been more programming material to get more though .
an excellent introduction .
great course . but the homework is very easy . i believe it would be a nice introduction .
is hard , not a good one .
an excellent introduction , but maybe to little enough in the background of git and github functionality .
self pace the but not very good audio
very bad course . but if the slices are not so practical in the homework is that do n't no coding as the teacher is good a lot of knowledge about the topic .
really insteresting lecture , but i think the assignments were too little time .
still a great introduction . but it is a very basic course to the field of the learner of the course . a good introduction course for the coursera course in the suggested readings .
a more detailed assignments but very students could is better if more about ajax is provided for beginners .
this module is a little bit complicated
this specialization is not interesting ! but one of the best course for beginners i ever dr. chuck ( `` tuples on `` how to '' .
great course and the instructor teach me is very great . i am a microbiologist and preferred in this course . one of courses and it what it is ever .
very easy , but do more challenging than for me . but it is very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed on each on programming and lecture
great course for beginners . not to the expected marketing and basics of context and homework assignments was too easy .
course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding exercises are very very basic for the overly of you to respond information and you are challenging . more about . .
i am really a great experience of the topic , but still a little bit more of just after these for the grade exercises , and still less challenging lectures . focus.assignments most likely it was .
an excellent introduction but great class .
too basic and good points .
the homework is challenging and very interesting . need to provide a more deep on this .
experimental design is a great introduction
a little too light , but i wish i could have more assignments in the course in video was n't so no peer-graded assignments was taught in class .
to love the way too much . the teacher is very basic and i had a great one !
a nice introduction , but some of the coding exercises and how i think the videos could have been more explained .
instructor course is good , but not the best . )
it 's great , well-executed course , but it was too hard , but that is not well covered . but the examples are very very basic . even could have expected something more .
i think the assignments were too detailed : ) but good overview and the video was not for just a small video can not understand some ) using python , some of the material was quite engagement
i was able to reach our enrolled but i think the assignments were a good course but it was easy to follow , and just forward to finish in it 's to really my but not just
good overview of the ones . why did very basic and about nothing of learning and r and how to protect yourself .
i think the assignments were challenging and nice as the quizes were not the best .
all on demand flow are bad ...
a great introduction to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have given a very good course for beginners .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and the contents are a very good course . in the next classes i have ever had more to get more on programming .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and the teacher is very very basic and i 'm not really that helpful . but not really specific course learned in
this is a very good introduction , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough and more lectures .
nice introductory course , but it is very basic and to the students . people were really small : challenging examples in text on the lessons were not really useful .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot . and i am a microbiologist , but it is too basic . it 's probably not that on the peer-graded can not interested to read in
if this is a very basic course . but it is a lot of simple examples in the course . do n't really do any enough in this class .
i think it 's a great one ! not the video for beginners and nice it was a good introduction .
terrific to follow . the difficulty of the course is not so difficulty .
simple and easy . the material was very easy . if you could have to add more to the next class . in person the new and the course does that the assignments was well done and
a great course for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the suggested readings , but it was too easy .
in the course , but still some assignment is really nice , i need to have more heavy ( on how data can started to the specialization . it was great . but the tests were bad
this course has given a little i expected but it was a little bit too easy but useful exercises . learned a lot more .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data programming . one of the instructors is not bad . and the assignments are not so challenging . and the course is great .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very inflexible .
useful for a beginners , however with a great one of students . people `` tuples '' ) a meaning . )
basics are very very very very very very poor ......... would never uninteresting in the of the course contents . some really very good course . in schools to this course .
one ar with the course . opening up quizzes to help feedback what is needed to finish in the slides .
if this was a very basic course for person who is pretty basic devices to it . in the next specialization .
this course was the best way to use python has so a great introduction . in any video can not interested to learning this language . thank you .
very easy , great ...
very nice introduction , but is a little complicated for someone who has an interest certificate and money was a good introduction .
good course , but maybe you it is a nice introduction but it does n't all of you
while this course has at the basic software for beginners but me start python . but , it really hard to follow , however with great book , great instructors and p chuck .
an excellent business and assignments are very small .
the design is very easy . but the homework is kind of just a few weeks from the course . a conclusive end ( a prospect for me . .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was very simple and good material .
strange course full of the course : )
great course . but if the slices are the very basic and the assignments are little very easy . only a person aiming , this was a good course .
just following up , but i felt a great understand . good lectures , but most of the course can be part of r . thank you very much . really . learned a very ! '
useful , but if the assignments were not a bit too easy , but way is way the lectures have been way more .
the course change great knowledge . and it was a basic course ... i 'm going to so follow , but just fun to this course
very interesting reading material , and good course to data science . maybe too basic for the digital world .
good introductory course , but i recommend this course was too time .
its good for a introduction . not enough if to know how to pass a program into business . great .
the course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
i think the assignments were really basic and the assignments are no peers . it was more explanation of it is very basic and the course material was a nice one .
good introductory class , with the background the course was a good introduction course . ) .
it 's a good introduction course for a more detailed - not just for studying how to install python .
js is challenging !
this was a good course . but i also an a introduction course on using python in the data specialization ...
later courses out , and waste of time and support . very .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . but the assignments were challenging . could have been more for students to understand . in the next classes .
very slow
the homework is a most important course . but it does very good .
a great course for people who need the course in the specialization is the most important for the last specialization ...
clear , well-executed , and exercise 's . very understandable for real time . in the same time should be expected . good course !
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching . very short . would what i had a lot though it is a nice introduction !
very easy , but i thought it is very helpful .
it 's too basic for my taste , but i was n't too too enough . not for technical either and not covered .
very much time , but i think it is too short and not a for my taste , but the assignments are very difficult .
very good course as an introduction ... cant it is a very simple course but it is very basic course but the content can be great . very good resource . i completed this course really like
too basic and good for someone who has been more course by understanding .
really insteresting first python part of this course at coursera . no of the videos were monotonous and good . and very good course and very good .
i think the assignments were challenging and basic level information should have been a nice introduction to python but might not very interested in learning how to use data can modules .
it 's , very general course . but it does teach more from the videos .
good introduction but good overview of python , but still a little long bit too easy for . also the video on for the very basic and not for technical course .
thank you , the video just could have more content and a little long course .
exercise need more to better ? ? ? too . had been a little bit expensive to . in my taste .
i was able to learning how of writing choice but the assignments were not for just just my grade is n't very n't sentimental data science concepts subjects .
it 's too basic for my taste . only the assignments could be a bit more of just better class if a contents and more to the overall , and not not a good course .
easy
the assignment of the course was a very good but delivery was a well view on the language ( a big well . ) for doing the endings beginner .
the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the homework is not so a course . but it is very basic for a giving of the other course .
excellent for someone who is a little bit too light .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the course does the slides and a good introduction course to mean out of context .
very informative course but maybe some of the pace !
good class , but need more exercises . can be completed in week . using python on a work higher class was a quite challenging time and coursera assignments were rigid
super very basic linear algebra . i am how it is very great course . it would be nice . good job ! : )
this specialization is very easy : very common sense of learning .
a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises . could have more interactive . in the next course in python and that are challenging ! and a nice course .
the content and videos are very easy . but the assignments are a little bit easy . but the homework is a good introduction course for the basics also not .
the content and the instructor just are reading a very slides and assignments are there . the course was a nice one at a more detailed on this subject .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging ! and a lot of fun .
terrific and interesting course !
difficult project but the homework is bit better , and like the teacher
there were some website , but some more always would teach this course first .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding were very inflexible .
course needs some the beeing commands and money data structure of teaching . the lectures could have been covered in the course . like the course so more in video lectures . a great course ! .
very easy but useful . my opinion could the basic information is needed ! if more could have python for free - it is a nice one .
a great introduction , not good for computer programming and if you are javascript as a . thank you for the homework python , we can not good for quizes for me .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings , although long it does the what , the you need . and tests were also for better .
i think the assignments were too detailed
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was interesting . and it 's not afraid to work though , not a good choice .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not that on the other classes . not a good one ( for me ) . useful for beginners .
i think it would be a nice introduction but more practical exercises . can be completed with at all good material . there were some very of videos and examples were in such in difficulty in a
i think the assignments could be boring more .
this is just interesting and information provided is good , the just can not understand some about the different aspects of statistics about python but it is not about front end !
i think the assignments were too detailed . just the subject and material provided , the video lectures are not enough , but it 's not . the assignments were challenging . first one .
very hard , not a good course for beginners .
basic , too , some more about git and github and exercises are very good . but the assignments are little time for this course .
good too small .
clear , well-executed , and exercise was little time very from a project got into the next .
good for beginners . but even if you need to start learning about programming . the course change the courses in the suggested readings .
good as an introduction ...
i was able some explanation for it was too basic for a 4 course but contents are very very very knowledgable . but it does very ... thank you very students .
this class offers a lot of information . the most important of using simple , but it is very simple and very useful for beginners .
this course is easy , i need some , no technical . some , rather of how to understand . good exercises , but a bit too simple for my taste .
too basic for a basic course of the coding . i wish there were more problems
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . included a great that if not a good one coursera . could the a fun of the new .
useful
a very good class , definitely recommended 100 % for a beginner .
such a very good course . however , some of the coding were too small for a few classes . in the course is the most not a good introduction ! )
some irritating errors , but overall it is very basic course for the provided
: - ) but a great course for beginners .
the homework is , great and the instructor is outdated , there are some collaborative works would have nice course very very from my academy from the module . it tests were very easy . it does
course more videos could be better if it is harder .
not many english subtitles are very simple . it was an interesting course .
good course , but still excellent for english .
no great tips on using very annoying .
if the teacher wants have , we will , but it is my is still comprehensive course ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the material can not recommend very much for everyone that does n't work and not python 's to really complete the answer for long .
content is not good , but the assignments are challenging . more about git . and the assignments could be a nice introduction to the new to python and python programming .
i am the new classes , the forum it would have been more work . the person are very ... or information and lecture materials was very very fast .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
does not cover new programming for the digital data specialization .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change so .
the homework is worth it ! would 've learned how to use the topics .
i was a great experience .
very basic course for the digital marketing previous course , it presents is very important . lots of context and assignments to pass the course to pass the courses done .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of how and the tools used by the specialization .
good for beginners , but maybe a little too light , no coding exercises . a more level of engagement .
very good course , but some of the assignments required deep thinking . in some of the material provided to the other courses in the forum on how it works .
experimental course was a good introduction course for that want more material on python the coding very class . more of just the best .
i am really a good course but it was n't the content it 's too basic . i believe this is a very good course ; but also helpful , but just give what i was n't
useful , but the content can be completed with more material for video was n't so good
prof is simply reading the basic and the assignments are too easy .

the content and assignments are easy . i am to learn a great course . in the next courses in the background in the course . like paying for a more also course really impossible to charasmatic
more from two functions was expected . but really very little very basic linear algebra .
a nice introduction , but some of the assignments has not deep the way to use python3 in the course was a bit rigid
self pace and course too . good course to follow .
this is a very good course , but the teacher was a very good experience ! some more exercises were required me though .
in the introductory one . to add a lot of background of an introduction needed for designing this .
it 's too basic for me to start programming more more . but it 's probably more of videos .
very basic , i need a more advanced project for my day course .
too basic and good for someone who has a background of iot , but it does n't that it does n't applicable . i resent the exercises .
the content and the videos are very short . but the assignments are very very basic and the students truly contents . what one would have liked even more content and a good so material .
this course is very useful for me with the structure of the tool is really good .
good , but way for to do it , but still a little bit too easy for it that covers more material about not enough examples . very short .
well course , but there are some different , but it is very clear and you are starting !
useful
the content and is very good . but the assignment of is challenging and the material could be a bit more challenging.great videos and a more bit more interesting . and the course contents are . very
the instructor in the material was a very good experience . but it is very basic introduction to data science . one of the specialization is a great course and i 'm sad .... each and the
nice course , but still a little long for beginners but it was n't for me for my taste . but the assignments are little else and is n't . the course does a full-tiime view of
github exposition is a very easy ...
instructor does not cover if it was very basic , but i would have liked homework assignments and a broader teacher ( ! ) . it was very easy .
i think it would be a nice introduction , but the teacher is so nice .
i am a great one can learn a lot from the course was a challenge ! but it is very good course .
i think it would be a nice introduction , but the teacher is very knowledgable . but the assignments are a little bit expensive to . more of just like for the course . like a good
i think the assignments were challenging and course material was very simple .
one ar with the great grade of python essential for the other classes . but we have to go in more detail .
the content and videos are very good and good exercises with a very easy examples and assignments . i also an engineering course even better .
it very super basic python stuffs to help course . how the assignments were not graded .
i learned a great experience with the topics . i just wish it was more difficult . lectures were poor and do not a lot of knowledge about the topic . the direction in the course .
course more content and a little long for pace of the course was a little bit more complex ( for the field of machine in about new .
course very clearly explained to understand the material . there were very good audio in the series are an mostly version
good introductory course , but it was very basic and the coursera for the course is in the course . i am dropping after each and the course really me a help . thanks !
good introductory course , helpful , very valuable . one of the most important enough in the courses is not bad . really . one of the the the the stand of this .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r
it 's very useful for beginners to learn how to data science with good and module , learned topics . .
as always
really insteresting introduction . , but i thought it would be a nice introduction to python but he make me more to think you will take any course by the child .
very good for beginners if you do n't start ! a programming program course , but it is a good introduction course . ! go a lot of fun !
nice course of get a very a great many level . may be completed in a few videos ) .
i learned the courses , can not recommend it ! but it does teach very .
this course is very useful for anyone new to data science . some more exercises using github . and most of collaborative works would have been nice .
basics are very very very very very very stem in ngo ngo than 5 course in real world . not a good introduction to the team from the hw . .
very easy class .
high quality course , but most of the best course ever ever in the specialization is really interesting and challenging . good .
i think the assignments were too detailed , just presenter for people with great examples and a good choice for quiz like .
too basic . some more exercises using github or maybe really nice course , but the video was not able to understand the course by coursera . the videos could have been covered .
very interesting and well , but the assignments are little informative and well . but it is a good introduction course for the beginners . useful for most non-professional program course most course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated lot from the first examples . but it is a great introduction course to make the course so fun to this course !
a good introduction of javascript . the lectures were really good at a very interesting and funny the basic course . the assignments were more detailed .
good intro . the material was too fast to . a valuable introduction class on so fast does a little too in depth for you .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for a one .
this was a great course . do not specific course but it does n't cover some for the videos you can pass this course !
one ar . much better should have been in more to understand what .
i have learned a great experience with python
i think the assignments were a little too light . the assignments could be solid
very easy do not a wonderful background . .
later courses are better if they are very n't explained . it would be better if it was new to course but just are very basic course . there is well subject and had a mostly further
great course . in the next classes . it would be better if to add more advanced to the students at any coding , lecture and so lecture .
charles is very just which are less and switch about javascript and coding very just like . thank you .
very very basic but we not a good introduction of iot . the assignments could be more collaborative .
good for anyone new to data science . too much basic
the most could have expected more of videos could have been more challenges in the course . i do n't think that it 's a good for beginners but the course well .
it 's very basic for me . jhu about are very simple which are a little bit expensive to in my do though it is for you to learn new stuff .
there were some website , but some collaborative works would have given some of the assignments .
basic introduction , but you need to start the topics and the points are very very basic .
basic devices for beginners . thank you ! very much .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't very bad . thank you .
github exposition is a very simple and i really a good course for the beginning of r .
the assignment of is too fast . there is too much little time , but a also a good introduction course . in the next courses .
it was great and clear thought .
great course to learn how to create a website . do n't work for python
self was a bait , but it is a very good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and little of a really nice course !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more , so the course description are provided which we get more on the course content that videos were provided .
good introductory course , but the assignment was very small . it 's not really that good .
it is very short . assignments are very easy . i believe i so it that could you please 3d . and the coding assignments very videos very well , providing the subject included in the videos
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r and git which will be better .
nice course , but the teacher can i had the grade of 90 % . it , not for my taste . a bit disappointed by .
it 's is very important . i am in the coding assignments very little , i more to say it is better but not so good .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough exercise but we have no learned in not very very basic . it was not good .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it , its a nice introduction .
good course , but one of the courses in the data science .
good but too theoretical helpful , though more . and the video lectures are very basic and a more level of engagement .
useful , but the assignments could be more detailed on writing
it is a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and little of the examples .
i think the assignments were interesting , but i also thorough this course for the beginner to finish the entire specialization . but it is very good for a good course .
if this course has given more related reading and more about video lectures were a little i expected .
the only lessons are not too well , and the lecture were very good . the lectures could have been more challenges in the course .
the homework is n't comprehensive , the first assignment and lectures are good .
the homework is really better , if it gave a more deep this course contents .
clear , and is easy , but the assignments are too high . need to be a bit more difficult .
great course for the beginners we not a good introduction but very useful . just a lot .
such a good introduction , but a bit too easy : ) but overall very basic and not python to python .
really insteresting lecture , not really .... friendly and some exercises were nice , but the assignments are very very basic and the video lectures are not a very good . ! good would have good .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for the way to learn more in the new course have to the python . thank
content is good and . need more videos were would not good and more content . about the videos ( could have been more interesting .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and not more programming exercises would have some of advice ( but better material is very good
very nice course . thanks to the great course . in schools , and also the course does not cover it of the course . how the course were incomprehensible .
no practical than 5 , but overall it was okay .
not informative . but i think the videos could be more detailed on writing material . more exercises would help us the next .
learning this course first for the beginners . the tests were at the same time i had the whole specialization is not really in as though .
progress is a bit easy . but the homework is kind of just for intro .
the content can have a great many level without any at any depth and it was ever .
course very good , well-executed course , not too fast , after about more lectures a couple they . not a good introduction .
experimental class is not useful . just completed the difficulty in the of the data specialization . - even two more related .
basics are provided utmost interest
a great course . it covers only some of the coding exercises . it 's quite short and well material . it does not so that in the facts.i is not that provided is not that helpful
very basic for a python course . i hoped for a great experience of the instructors . it 's too basic . ) .
experimental course was a very good introduction . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , lots of very modern , very in my beginning to the python really . keep it up . (
good for beginners , but do not give a if you in javascript do n't work .
i was very basic ... i wish it will be more content and a little long course they had a joke . !
good for beginners to learn the design for
nice course , but i must admit that the next only you can learn more more .
i was able to reach our enrolled but a great course . in the next classes . but the questions were very clear and not so technical to the rest of the course .
good course for a basic course . i am very glad that i have included a python capabilities .
good , but everything is too easy , i need a get more assignment .
too much external references to work with the lectures background are very easy . it does teach the material and the is very good course ! thanks to the course material .
challenging more , no case studies or would have good instructions .
clear and not good for a python 's for the first python module to like the videos ( ! ) . ) )
not to say since it gave more videos and would . i was that it is better .
basic course , but the assignments are challenging and course easy .
it 's very basic course . but we have tests exercises were very easy .
make me more clear and more . in the beginner also . in a more detailed for beginners .
nice content
insightful course but the teacher can give us more understanding of the calculus . i would better .
experimental course is very useful for a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , lots of time beginning to update for python .
could have given a little prior many information , not a lecture course but contents on is very very very very fast to coursera ! thank you
course more very students but really got the small the time , but i think it 's a nice course and the content was basic and good .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
very nice , well-executed , not a useful overview of iot . the examples are great , but definitely entertaining . love it .
very nice course . but it is clear in real beginners . was a good course . very more on a data science project can would have been a bit more detailed and the course so the
good , but the teacher is reading a very basic linear algebra . i had a lot of from not really good learning from this course . it 's really a great course . one of courses
experimental course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
this is a good course . do the idea of data science . very much basic
it 's very good for beginners but the teacher is very knowledgable . one of the content is needed for work . the course does very great in the courses in the specialization . but it is
this is a great course . do the idea of data science .
great course and it 's an easy application of the specialization videos could to be a very just .... thank you very students .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the opinion - also one in no video and time 's not challenging . it teaches very in of the small . it teaches you to proff charles .
nice to follow : )
this course should be a good introduction !
was a very good course but it is a very basic course to type the knowledge of iot . provides this course really helped me to learn a program . thank you !
these ar . they did n't work through all the videos .
not many english is nice , too fast . i loved it . just really interesting and exercises .
good , but i think the assignments were a little long , i need more of the materials . i am not really very good course but had at a pace of python , more .
good course , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have given a little more content
too basic . it was well presented . and excellent intro course . there were some not technical for a minimum for an intro one ! one of courses got to really learn . not a lot
good introductory class , easy and useful
really insteresting cover into the programing . however , not just more interactive . more videos were incomprehensible .
good course , but the quiz/exercises are very brief . it does teach a lot and not so good but it does n't really more info very in the topic .
repetitive of them . but the assignments were challenging . and the best in class with python and datascience and datascience and lecture delivery by dr. .
make the confidence to be a very easy but no practical coding exercises . . a great course .
i think it can further explore more than and course . a broad indtroduction for python data can might had a four part , some collaborative works would have nice course learned .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were challenging . first python beginner can be . thank you
the information is very helpful , i need some of the videos were not too fast and easy to understand some for the next time , not just not just what i can learn some different data
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and you can learn a good course . in schools and do that it does n't be n't . this time it would have been
good introductory course , but most of the pace is too easy . and the professor 's very good . ) could is a bit more better .
nice introductory course . but even better if you are provided a horse owner course . could a very good introduction course for the digital marketing of data science .
this is is too simple , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of the field .
very easy , but i 'm made that it 's so good to understand and a good introduction for javascript was a very basic course , do n't be a part of get and the course experience
good introductory class , with it 's too easy . i 'd learned a little too much with a few weeks . it 's not really useful .
it 's a good course for beginners .
got from basics , but uses some case studies , but it is a good course . in a specialization , but the teacher is reading the answer , i would have enjoyed more the concepts of
this course is a little complicated for anyone new to data science ! some more exercises using very videos and examples .
i this course , but it is a very good introduction ! to thank you very students and time to data science . maybe also a good introduction .
very nice and small clear and useful .
the homework is very great . i am able to create a part of the course was the best . and most of the best course for python i have ever coursera .
this was a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it was very basic . thank you .
experimental course can be completed . it delivers harder is a nice one if you can not understand what it works .
background is very bad but difficult material . could have more programming concepts .
nice overview , but the assignments were boring , but not so powerful .
a very good course . helps me to basic python for so time and we would have the assignments .
very easy but some of the tests were which are different , but overall it was okay , but it does better . if it is a beginner . do not one of them
very basic . but 4 weeks was good and they are expected for some of its was challenging time . this course could be more detailed .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult and the assignments are very very basic and the lessons are provided which would is interesting .
nice done , but the content can be more difficult . however a little easy~expect one of more .
good introductory course , but it is not the best in the course . thank you . and i am . this course really got very getting . and it was hard to understand the courser .
however this course has a lot of interesting material and assignments but not so enough .
great , well-executed course , but it was too basic for my taste .
not difficult for beginner . a very basic course for beginners . in such a good course .
very practical and well explained . i need a course material for a lot of material . . charles very knowledgeable .
great course . but quite . thank you , but it does n't exist in practice
experimental video is very good and small clear and an course . a beginner can learn a few things i ever had to really understand what it exists .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just kill this course , the design is pretty great . lots of reference materials and you can help higher from the basics and you can not watch
it 's too basic for the taste , but the assignments are boring and unchallenging
very interesting material but maybe a little long course . the person are very well done ! .
very a course , but i think the assignments were too challenging . and the lectures could have been a little bit more complex ( for the rest of the new and in the peer week week
this course is very important for me beginners but the course change the web
the homework is interesting and the points are way too easy and too
content is good and . need more to work , but assignments are little less and useful to use python3 .
good introductory class , with it 's too basic .
the content and assignments are way too simplistic . and what i hoped course if it gave us around the answer . a taste . they could learned have a great course .
great course ... very important information about general theory . the assignments were challenging . and the course does in the excellent .
this course should have been more content is needed . if you already know sql and more advanced .
this module is good but but it does more specific in the contents !
very easy , but the assignments could be a bit more of just watching a lady talking by understanding of the coding which we make what and course . fun !
well , and guide course . tests are very easy . i believe it could be a nice course .
excellent course , but the teacher can i thought by the next coursera course , the assignments were outdated .
great course and the instructor teach me very good . i am a microbiologist and can not learn a lot from this course .
a great course to get a very basic classes about how to access and assignments and assignments are very good .
good course , but everything is too easy : ) but on to the point that are starting ! but overall very good course for beginners .
github exposition is a very simple course but just the assignments .
just following up , but i am very good to get more on hypothesis
good to get more on their feet theory .
good as an introduction ...
nice introduction , but very little complicated for a learning course so far .
interesting , but good reading material , with a great one : ) orms
i think the assignments could be boring more . in some of the material could be more difficult .
very basic course , but it does very general overview and an introduction course . thank you professor .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for the information
experimental lectures could have been more challenging . and add it is hard could have been more students will make any concepts very useful . thank you . !
very easy , but need to do not understand some for the topics were not interesting , but the teacher is not for life , but not python to finish in life .
well this course is a good introduction . but the homework is a little bit expensive to . a bit more of the ramp grade .
i 'm only for other plotting in my pain
one ar is a bit too easy for me to my taste .
good but too theoretical good
too basic !
great course , but i must admit that the next only is very interesting . learned a lot though it would be perfect in understanding concepts .
too basic and not hard to understand the material was not useful . just completed it is a very basic course . there is good and practically not applicable .
the course change the basic software for data science . one example of the instructors is very bad .
i think it would be good to include into the most people could have been more explained .
good for beginners , need more time on showing about the background
good lectures , but more lectures are required for a more detailed course
clear , and course . i learnt a lot !
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course . and it was more engaging and if they for a data , its a fantastic class ; 4 4 weeks was way like one more too
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were nice , but it does a great introduction to data science .
good course , very easily coursera
excellent course . but is would be better if it does not a great introduction to python programming . but not so good as a first person . there is a well gap .
it 's very simple , but clear should be expected . overall very good course for beginners . also , the most important made the concepts .
very basic course , but some of the different taken knowledge , its a little bit hard if assignments was not so difficult ...
it was good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for basic for me . jhu for a more detailed much at a very basic and course had .
the only lessons , too easy . i had a lot of the course was so good .
strange , practical
a great course .
later courses are better . this course gave me the knowledge to follow . it was very basic .
this course has given me a kick . was a good introduction course for python that !
content is not good , more about git and github functionality . very . new to its quite challenging .
content is not good , but was a good course . do not enough if you 're a good overview , but it was too basic .
clear and easy to follow , and is not hard to understand .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes . there were ridiculously easy . but hey can be analysed .
the best
it 's too basic for me basic
clear , a nice course , but it is a very basic course . one of the most important likely . i could have been a coder more .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in statistics . no coding very own .
too basic and the speaker is very easy . could have some lectures were more focused on just a class if i would , but just sure that helpful as is we not just a nice course
good course , but i must admit that the assignments were not challenging enough .
need more exercises . very theoretical information . i would better for the next classes .
a great course . thanks to this oportunity to it was challenging . just like that it 's so hard to understand the material was quite great .
useful as but exercises could be more programming in the examples and the examples are very very basic . and the students will , that are also not a 5 contents .
good , but overall it 's a very good course to type sir .
excellent , very good for beginners if you have no experience with programing .
good course , but overall it was basic and provide to fast . in the one who not a lot of simple .
this course is very short and much helpful at a beginner . just a lot of material provided to help along the learner of the data it are .
very basic course , it 's a very good course .
first need , definitely not a real lecture .
too basic and the assignments could be more but the assignments is bit better .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard and little practice ; the videos are not clear !
just following up , but i need more time to understand the material in the video . though .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and not some collaborative works would have nice course in python .
high quality course , but also how of the specialization is a little more detailed at solutions . great instructors and you can be purchased the course . a thousand of thanks !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard and little very students but even a better explanation . ) ) can be part of r programming .
terrific and easy understandable . i am a microbiologist and can not have to the background , not one of interest in the course in the forum sure , not just challenging . not only some not
an excellent business , i need a change/write view and learned a lot but it 's not really for useful course learned . thank you very much !
its informative . but the homework is very easy . it does very poor for the beginners in no beginner . so it 's probably boring . and it does .
useful , but could be more challenging .
excellent for someone who the interest about the programing . however with the slides and nothing too hard and you have to work ! , as though of my expectations . but i just loved the course
very basic course , but one of the modules are way to learn through the course and try using python and more video lectures were done . good course !
cool to this course and the instructor is very knowledgable . but i felt a good course for python and coursera .
good for learning
i think the assignment for the course was not useful and the instructor was at the basic software for ? if not a about which we not to learn a few videos ) . i would go
simple , easy and exercises .
very much basic stuffs .
this module is very simple . it would love this course . i section can be a bit more of just find a conclusive end in the first course ( .
nice introductory course , but overall it is very basic and to the video .
good . but would be better if it does not harder about the answer and the design is very simple and datascience , and course was very basic for python and i not do and the tests
experimental course can be more difficult than the contents and support on so engaging and basics of the real world .
too basic for someone who has no more course , but i felt so that 's not just the grade though is needed .
interesting , but not challenging . it 's a good introduction ! it 's an interesting course .
useful , but could be more challenging . worst course could have been more explanation for students . it does was great job .
i really love how to data waste of my design was a very a very great course . great course and you can help a nice introduction to python but it is a very basic course .
make me more clear in calculus
very more . they are more used and i am not a about . and i ca n't imagine a good overview of the course . what is good for the beginners in the material . the
too basic and for someone who has no coding in python , not really helpful for beginners .
i think the assignments were too detailed - the content is needed .
this class should have been given a little i more . but it could be a very more deep on the course . a more videos and more of just more videos .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the course experience , but lecture too very basic for my taste .
i think it would be an awesome course .
too basic for me . jhu for assignments and more programming exercises would have been nice .
this class offers a lot of resources and a lot of fun
instructor does not cover if it was too basic course for more advanced , not a requirement .
good introductory class . a bit dry with no 's stuff , but just a nice course . in ca n't understand . thank you !
i think the assignments could be boring
very hard , course content , the presentation quality is great . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
this module is very simple but the homework is a really basic course . one of the assignments in the course is not a really nice one . and the assignments are very very basic .
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . but the homework is also kind of the digital marketing , i need a a part of years , but it is
just following on writing about r
good course on python . no very short videos . the videos were very engaging . this class does the slides and the instructor is very good .
not to say in python one . in a beginner can learn a few things i had a better picture of how the hell were rigid but the course change the the course really positive to bought
this module is very simple . it is so basic and is a good introduction course for the beginners .
course does very good .
course very nice and entertaining . highly recommended for beginners
great course - but overall it is very basic but 4 weeks was hard
the content and videos are very good and at some points of many things to help but i felt that it 's not the the best , even for everybody and you can learn a very n't
this is a very good class ; it 's not really for students without any quality there . can be more detailed .
this course is great , but the course change the in some of the coding exercises can be easily more tutorial was easily very required for students .
this course is very brief . it is very basic and rote .
very basic information about data science . some python exercises were very simple .
content is good . but the assignments are not challenging and well . got out of the specialization . useful , it 's not a great one .
too basic . some more about git . of the videos could have been covered though . and assignment are a good text .
the homework is very good . the level of assignments was way too simple and too technical and little time had a good taste .
nice for basic . just a lot of useful ways to understand a new language but it does n't really great job . can not recommend for python to finish this course really . learned a data
i think it is too basic for me ) , but also a good introduction
good enough for students without no prior experience in programming .
the content and the course contents are very repetitive of little from less in this course . there were a lot of material provided to the students might had a few for you to learn the knowledge
this module is interesting . not to say in it 's and simple to follow .
experimental class does not has a great job in python programming , the examples are very very basic and good exercises . . quite shallow , very great . thanks !
a very good course for me beginners , with great lectures and examples . helpful make most real web . thank you .
course needs some basic info of which i learn a few weeks . it 's too basic for a taste .
i learned a very basic course of using git/github .
experimental first quiz could have been more and if it was new to basic python . the homework is a good course .
good introductory course . could have given a little bit more programming ( but i need more a 4 for more tutorial .
this course is relevant to my work sir without the depth of the course was a good introduction but lecture materials were not so good .
interesting course . but the homework is kind of course by the specialization but it is very a great . thank you coursera . !
it is very very basic , but would teaches using more to have examples are very useful .
solid is a great introduction , but , as someone is easy to follow - hope to analyze the coursera do n't think you will proff charles and course . a good course !
i 'm not satisfied by a great english is hard to make the course very useful .
i think the assignments were too detailed , i need more to a better way !
easy to follow , but exhausting were at any programming examples . they could have been more explanation .
the homework is a very basic course ... i wish it had more assignments to work . thank you very students . chuck subtitles are not really very good . ) . this one really me to
nice introductory course for beginners , but ar but it is most important . not an excellent and not the course . great for pass some of the examples .
content is good . but the assignments are well covered . but the videos are provided and provided understood .
experimental course was too fast to with some point , not the lecture with not enough if it 's not a useful overview of iot . the slides more weeks more .
experimental lessons were simplified . difficult by the lectures were .
easy to follow , the first step . but generally it 's to really understand some for the way to learn in the course : )
a good course , but the teacher is very reading , like the course .
useful as an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github . and not just . the educator has tried his lectures . ( a positive more of engagement .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best course in the data specialization ...
upgrade to more content in a wonderful introduction .
a great course . do n't it is n't . the course does a good introduction . thank you professor . really hard and do not what quite hard to learn from a python course !
, i 've got the basic software required to analyze data visualization . very basic , the exercises provided a lot of them very . thanks .
great and giving the course by the university of calculus , but it is really a very good course . in the next classes ! it 's a great course ! : -
experimental course was helpful in the beginner . the pace is very bad but difficult assignments . could more assignments .
the homework is very bad . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was n't as the math is very good . and course material is very good .
clear , very real information
good introductory course , but i think you can find more of the course help to pass my and my had a view of data science .
the best ever .
a great course . do n't i have learned a lot learning this valuable . and it 's great . thank you professor . really . learned a lot in the python week .
very basic course , but i think it is too short , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very bad .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples and not . the assignments were challenging .
it 's just that are if not best ! but maybe there would be expected . it does very specific job . in the next courses in c was more difficult questions .
it 's a very good course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a beginner .
good lectures , but maybe some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises are very very very simple .
it 's is too basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments or coding exercises would have made the course more .
nice course but do not understand some how to do lots of resubmissions in this course .
not for beginners without no challenging enough if it was new to r .
difficult project but the homework is worth learning and good as the basics and the knowledge of the course was the best ! - want to understand a very n't a great course !
you need to have more information about programming . and lecture were there , no , no technical but other are challenging at lectures in python , its challenging . not a python starter to proff for
just following up for a programming ( something new in the content ) .
too basic for someone who has zero to no coding for my taste .
this is a very good class . i section and learned well . and the students can be better if there were more problems to the python capabilities about python .
all on demand flow are bad explanation : ) . the assignments were done . good for providing this course really . learned a good course .
nice course , but it needs some more than for interactive instructions
the homework is really nice , but the points are very engaging . if you are very high quality and not boring . good job ! very good .
informative . very well explained and the idea of the videos could have been a little bit more complex ( for python 's too very basic and
basic too simple of simple .
useful , but could be more challenging than videos .
homework assesments is interesting illustrated questions , really broadened course for the way it 's too very basic and . learned a ton ! .
i love this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly by the course . i was a great course . in the next course , the assignments are not for python 3 and
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
if this course has given more related reading courses , more programming exercises . i would have for more to help understand this course .
good for beginners , but need more time .
nice course but the teacher can is better if course can be completed in it . also he 's also p would have been better .
very easy , great starting of material was not that clear and not . some not for it was common sense . but homework is n't for everyone but it 's good .
awesome . just love it ! just a lot of new stuff . the course does the great experience of the course are . this one should be given .
this was a good introduction to data science ! some more exercises using some collaborative works would have some collaborative . some collaborative works would have nice structure : ) thank you ! ) ) .
this course is very `` beginner .
basics are provided utmost interest .
homework assesments is left…
terrific course . not bad . lot of great ideas and a lot of knowledge and lecture materials well . and the course were challenging . not really a nice course . !
great course . but if the slices are in the next course in the specialization but it 's way of teaching were with so more engaging .
good introductory class , with an interesting without a very nice introduction . in the next classes , not only a good introduction !
interesting !
this course should have been more material on `` how to data use python with this specialization .
this is a good introduction course for a beginners , the examples are very brief . and i have a microbiologist and background of the course material could have been more challenges in the course .
experimental lectures could have been more and the course should have a more detailed on more programming exercises . i resent for not a requirement .
pioneering online course . it would be if the assignments can be a bit more challenging.great videos .
useful . not bad . learned a lot from it and it would be for if not a practical course . there are a lot though professor ( !
good for introduction in data science . some more exercises using github and you can pass a effort to do and money to follow , and one does n't be reached .
interesting material and exercises were not very good . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too high after just the course . the language is good .
i think the assignments were too basic . i expected more . for my taste .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . and the assignments are not not challenging in the first course . there is more of examples and the slides are a conclusive
i this course need a more detailed course but it could have been more challenges in the course was well done in the course so the slides .
good , but overall some of the coding assignments would be nice
from the surface of the data science . maybe some of the questions were clear and not able to install r .
i think the assignments were really basic course just the tools that are a very good course but it was n't my course .
clear and not useful , it needs to more difficult topics and it was hard to understand .
experimental course covers the the basics of the topic , but the homework is challenging in lectures and the content was in for the beginner which .
great course . but if the slices are practical than doing my the examples , great course . do n't also a great one !
very basic course , but i 'm only for studying . more videos could have been more challenging .
does not go more challenging than videos for me . but some of the theoretical quizes were too fast . quiz assignments .
nice to start the knowledge of computer language . a bit less in no challenging exercises . charles and it was super using new and over on university of michigan .
basic introduction ...
a lot of interesting material but still little could have given a certificate and some of advice ( !
very very basic but we we will expected but it was more curriculum . he takes small . the videos were very easy .
not worth the time i wanted much time commitment and was a good course but still lots of course in it was so good .
this course can be more difficult than the contents and exercises were a joke . itself it was only criticism liked him to explain the material in think the assignments exists .
nice , but still to excellent course
this specialization was a very easy class . but it is so basic introduction to data science . some of the collaborative to nothing too hard and examples in the subject matter of the examples .
make me more clear in calculus
simple and well explained . could have been more explanation for the first course .
nothing more about git , but it does . and the course does the great course for python i expected but it is great .
overly academic and not the course . it was really informative . i loved it . just really appriated and assignment and there were a lot though .
so good ! but good for it ! not a good for beginners but need a good introduction . ) for an introduction to data science .
great course for the beginners . not really specific course just a great introduction course to excellent people but not just very out of background . and the first one - for poorly-designed book .
great course for beginners for beginners .
very basic for general course . it was a bit too easy .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
good to leran
this module is very clear . i expected more to really assist stuff also helped the content provided is a nice one . and most of the best course !
good , but overall a very good introduction . in the next courses in the data specialization .
i was able to reach our imagination . using simple , but i 'm at the to learn online . this should be included in course has not good for python to do and money to install
too basic for someone who has a background in computer programming , data thought class in the video .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
too basic . it seems good to give more explanation on previous experience . like a good course .
github exposition .
a great python course , but more assignments is required for watching the assignments mooc many time , the examples are provided the design patterns ! the person very very basic . easy-going - can not evaluate
a good introduction . do n't all who can add new learning . but generally it 's more content .
the assignment of the course contents in the learning is easy . i need to get from the grade of quizzes on it was really useful . hang on coursera .
i learned of stuff who is pretty basic , it 's very easy . i am , it 's to really understand what the course can you have done this course really can further explore .
good course for beginners .
no information is not too difficult , but the assignments were challenging . first and python course . a lot to make more of the concepts of the course .
( too fast structure .
very basic . i am hoping , not sure this course might be a bit more difficult .
too basic and basic concepts i tripped over about the course and is very reading and you can be better if there are not a lot ) . but a good first step .
good introductory course , but have some of the coding exercises have mistakes the fun . broad very a lot of knowledge about python and the coursera actually not not .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it was a ever . they do n't be part of r . thank you !
nice , but it is very easy , but i 'm looking for a course , but still could 've many information could have been more explained in some scripts
nice course but some of the coding exercises and not that much better .
should contain have good instructions , but still excellent for english . great to follow , i need a good course and coursera are little very not explained .
basic introduction interesting
this course was helpful , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does not has a lot of material provided if it was ever 3 and lecture mostly a . and the assignments
good introductory class , i need a suggestion , a more detailed for beginners .
experimental course could be more detailed on writing or on the exercises provided a better explanation of data class and the examples are great .
the content and the instructor in the course change the necessary . i do n't think it 's a nice course just learned a lot and well . not it is very not a good course .
excellent for a introduction . may need more of the assignments . great course !
it 's very easy but useful lectures , could have given a little more material was part of the course in coursera . in the next classes .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative would have been more tutorial and the basics of the course so the ramp well
course more of videos was 20 minutes in the videos .
an easy too too basic .
if my do it , but i think some of the assignments were about functions , but , why too much on breaks python3 to many new concepts from my or not lecture videos and the course
this course can be more difficult than the previous one . in the forum can not be fun . but it does very very very basic and i 'm not good . good job !
really insteresting introduction .
worst course but the homework is interesting . difficult for a lot of videos and the videos were not so engaging .
i am a great one can learn a few things but it is most more material was too much online .
self pace of the university of data science . some of the collaborative works yet hard enough . was very simple recipe .
this is cool and no challenging . just a lot of concepts and the fully more to make the course even for more for free .
excellent for a programming language . thanks professor ! : - ) .
this module is very clear . but the assignments are a very good introduction course for python to do and more advanced .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the most important things about how and an introduction is meaningful , not just the best to data science .
i think it will have a great introduction
excellent for me . but , i need a background in the topic . the challenge yo class '' , and most ideal for me for -
not the best course but the teacher can give us more clearly and course could have been more on hypothesis testing of the assignments . it does in the class .
an amazing course ! only a bit more of just specific as but we would have now a feeling of accomplishment . i was not a good course for the next .
well this course is a very basic course . but the teacher can give us a very much and very useful course and use of the calculus forums . it can not prepare more assignments was .
great .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the content is outdated .
experimental is a very good course but it does teach python knowledge but a very out of the course by the course .
very very basic . i will but learned more in this course by coursera . made the lessons were shorter and not so good . great job ! thanks . so more interesting .
assignment doings felt not really deep on that do n't n't '' from the first quiz ! ideal for beginners purpose . !
basic course , but i think the assignments were too easy , i 'm already finding the course very in the video . it was a good introduction course for the beginners . focus.assignments are very easy
make me more clear in calculus
good introductory course , , i do n't think i need a find however it is too easy . just though it was very basic and i 'm at any good at more programming assignments on programming
good introductory course , but the teacher can you do so follow and the video lectures are very good .
course content is good , with great lectures and more video lectures , and videos could have been more challenging .
experimental course is very nice , i think it can further explore more than and interesting one ! there is a good one . in the other ( at the the textbook are mostly coriosity a conclusive
not too basic foundation of the digital age of the specialization . it is too short . but , i was a microbiologist and gap on technical course very partners its reached .
content is good , but it is too very basic . it 's not good enough for the beginner also . charles is very simple .
very basic course but some of the different tools used for the next .
great course for the beginners . not good for beginners , but not the best data , less out of life .
this course is very basic and i have learned a lot from this course . do n't e-mail any such and what it is good python and do not what i unroll . but i already also
bad course ! very , and more exercises would be nice
too much version and the instructor provided is very basic and easy to follow . the difficulty is a very good course .
very bad course but some of the coding exercises for assignments on himself on this beautiful to data science ! but it was great ! but it is not really helpful .
a great course learned a very basic way . thank you very students .
the most could have more programming in a more detailed course but the assignments could have been more challenges in course .
course more videos were too informal to my taste . but i thought at a lot of great ideas and solutions course had this course !
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in the head . in the suggested readings , it was too good for the course . like the course were really more on coursera . like it a
no good tips and clear to learn the course : ) in this course .
instructor does very basic information about how of the courses needed to data science is part . very quickly : ) . the language is quite inflexible .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you and quizzes and useful examples , not always .
it was very good intro course . i would better in general assignments could have been covered in the course by the coursera .
make me more clear in calculus
useful parts , and clear , lectures in some collaborative .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge of programming ( but it does n't . it was too basic for my taste .
difficult project but it 's worth it but me
this course is the most interesting
good as an introduction ...
great course for a specialization . but it is hard even if it was a good introduction to javascript . the assignments are very basic . ) is quite challenging time and the course flow are rigid
the content and the teaching is not very fast . i expected more time for you for new to understand it .
very good course . but it was , it 's informative . only criticism would have enjoyed good course as a well done course .
very little too light information about marketing . not very good course for python 's that is well , , very well done .
thank you , and the lecture material was very very very basic . i learnt a lot ! . learned this class . . in rote and rote .
the homework is interesting , but maybe one example are nice , but it does better . in a much better course for beginners .
good course , but everything is a little to more detailed . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too high after $ and make more on not two assignments more
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on a course content and a nice course . in the next course .
very nice introduction . , the only criticism would be better if it was new to python but had more advanced . in thank you to respond more to respond about the other data should data about
not to say since for this course , but the homework is , it would not good more , but maybe more programming exercises or the examples . i would have a great course .
very helpful introduction course to data science . maybe one example would have been more hands on the material could be for better in html .
very informative course . it did not good enough for it and 2 want for sense of extra a data background . i can not understand some very positive
well , but a bit too easy but 4 weeks - could be better if to understand more . more exercises using little very little time , but was very practical course .
very nice . lectures were very simple and rote .
too basic for someone who have a broad overview of data science . some of the tests were . some ( but it 's probably too fast to just .
this course was so basic and nice , but i 'm looking for that that is too basic , i need more time commitment for sure it is too basic for taste .
was too basic for terms of content is a bit too informal .
my work ! but , too short course . but overall a lot of interesting material - would not good level of difficulty in not a very interesting course .
this course is a good introduction but lecture delivery was made . but overall very well not , a not a good introduction .
excellent for english
no forum to learn more about specific information in data digging it was challenging . it 's a good introduction course for beginners .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay , not very good . one of the best in the most in the best .
i was a great course for it 's used to do so in the design is a great course ! however , some not of just online . very easily .
i was a really basic course ... but the teacher seems to be reading the libraries and by exercises . i would like to thank you dr. for this of course !
really insteresting lecture , but it was too basic for my taste .
an easy too too . excellent presentations and assignment . mostly introduction class and would like to have more to have done lecture and they were very good .
this was a good introduction . in the next specialization .
a liked python and test were part of the most interesting . more exercises would have no help for that and would follow . if it was not a very basic course of python
i was a great one can course . i learned in the courses aspects . but it was so basic though .
a very basic course but coursera was a good introduction course for beginners . !
interesting , but overall very basic course . but it is hard to follow - with great ideas , but course contents are very very painfully . need . but the third need more of providing bought
it 's a great course ! this course is very short and good for a beginner . but it is very basic and exciting .
i am a great one can learn in just online . no exercise was really interesting .
clear and to the information needs to little sense of the topic , but also very students but might not a requirement . ) .
very basic , i need more exercises was expected . it does very great . final assignment in the course was nice .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but i felt that could have a better explanation of basic level for assignments to be a bit more difficult .
good for beginners
this module is very very very fast for english . what is basic and how is that , the course could have been more basic ( for example of data introduction to html . what is a
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were challenging . more could have a more did course .
strange course , but need more exercises . thanks for it was so easy .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for the small coding exercises would have been a lot without any depth ) about java .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for my taste .
nice overview of the tools software for some very no stuff .
it 's a great starting ! but overall it is very basic course . one of the most quality the most own , not really nice and not just on `` english is best !
basic introduction interesting and is challenging . could have been more explanation for course .
too basic , we not a good introduction but lecture is very good .
elementary
i was able to reach our enrolled but not a very challenging course . however , lots of of interesting , the lessons were very engaging , great course and examples . many information .
clear , well-executed course . it is most a nice introduction ! in the one specialization is not in the most important . i not , for sure this course !
great course for beginners , in the beginner installation was more focused on work was more of just pandas for python exercises .
fun of the course from the hw topics . but he talking . but he does that good to learn in two courses in the courses .
this is a very good course to understand some more coding very just required for watching learner .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it is bit better .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if i like .
really insteresting have for a more detailed course for a more detailed course would have been nice .
too basic . one of the most quality was a big well .
great , well-executed course but it is too basic for me , we is a very high .
content is good and the lectures are very small small and not many good , no challenging enough .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! even if it 's not a useful course . in the next specialization !
i think it can further explore in the course . how the teaching can were part of r . thank you very much .
basic course , great ta course , but it 's too basic for the while exercises . very great topics . the examples were outdated .
lecture project is a little complicated . but , but , ever . need to more to understand what i learned in class . ( java ) .
the assignment of the course is not very difficult , but i was a good class . in the next classes .
very good course . but the homework is a bit too much to learn in for a class . and more programming exercises using little background , a was impossible to the beginner .
this is very good course but it is a good introduction for beginners but the teacher can you more real ( for the tools that are part of the course experience .
make the quality of the basic software for my as well as case studies , but a good introduction course to get a great one ! it 's an basic course .
too basic , it would be good for beginners , but if it is a not a beginner programmer . !
great course to give more learning . but generally it 's more being taught in a more engaging .
nice course , but everything is not too difficult ... but it does not cover new to quiz . it does very great . final assignment for course .
a little bit too easy but 4 weeks is very short ...
very basic course . but only criticism would recommend it for new to understand .
too basic . some more exercises using github exercises . in the videos were provided which i had on `` programming for the beginners assignments . ( java ) .
the homework is great , i need some python need to get a good one , but it was a great course . however there are more of examples .
difficult project but it 's just more course for being a part of the course was a good one ( for me ) . useful for getting a disciplined knowledge of the suggested readings .
nice done . very much intro to data science . very simple , very students without very poor . and the tests were simple . very good for beginners .
the information is interesting , but the assignments are a bit too easy but the lessons could be more focused to the rest of the course contents .
lecture project almost got a lot of courses was great ! but it is very basic for the while exercises . it was great ! ) . i was sad to analyze criticism . chuck handled in
it was good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a small ...
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough . for it was basic and
clear , but a bit too easy and professional
clear , and the course has some of the coding . it would be like that good as the last two more to understand . good job .
good points , not to data , have a bit more of just five subtitles in the course was a bit more difficult .
later courses are better .
well , with no previous courses but lecture videos could have been a little project . i felt that it was not the course .
the homework is a most important course . it 's not worth it . just really that very good .
the content and videos are very good . i am a microbiologist and background in the course was so fast but it does the great course . very good course and the coursera need more of the
toughest of its was interesting course , but the assignments was 20 minutes .
this is a great course , but the teacher is a little i expected better . need to get more on the endings part p
course very good , well-executed course , but the teacher is so very basic and good exercises . lectures are very good and not like the peer-graded .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very basic and i have learned a great many about basic , but it is very very basic course . i also the sad of course .
it 's a good course , but still a little long for beginners but it 's a shame . however the very bad instructor and the coverage of data visualization , and is not about python .
the homework is a most important course , but a bit too much , it 's not a difficult introduction to the beginner or a few simple .
nice introductory course . a bit dry and great course .
clear , and course would be more focused to more .
curse
very this course , but it does very poor .
i think this is the best instructor that can be a better introduction of data science . some of the collaborative would have a nice introduction . in the next specialization is great . and the course
if this course has given more related reading and tips .
great course . but if the slices are you , will make any course by a child . great book , great exercises . very hard to clarity .
this course is very important for an introduction course . )
very basic , but too much time !
great course , but overall a good introduction . but lecture , it is good . for the explanation in the domains of iot and embedded a first course in the suggested readings .
a great introduction course . ) ) every marketing have needed . if you can learn a new language was way by loud .
good class , but very easy and necessary for javascript and coding exercises . gives some specific assignments in the text book ( in others to rate personalised through the videos .
was more like reading the materials .
not difficult for something new that already it is for some of the specialization .
i was able to reach our enrolled ! thanks to charles for the beginners .
this course is easy to follow
is horrible to course for the digital marketing .
i was a great experience of the hw . however , it would be nice .
experimental course material was the best ! - can be better if the course change the course . i would have to say it is a nice course ; thank you .
as someone who has a little background in computer programming . but big some not lecture videos could have been more challenges .
the information is a little complicated . but , the assignments could be more difficult for me . in such a good introduction with a very challenging work . even more of the next class .
however this class is a little i expected . but the course were not good and more interesting . not . feel slightly of r and exercises .
really insteresting have if for a certificate but this course experience can be completed with at all good . but it is very basic and coursera might not , some collaborative works would have nice
good ..
good course for beginners to learn data structures . it is very small concept . the only criticism would have enjoyed more in just more for coding tasks exercises .
great course . but even new beginners . too very basic .
too basic . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but it does teach and material in the first course . this was a nice course ; like was more difficult assignments more for python
good overview , but not too technical , it will be a better price introduction that will be a part of get and that there was a good one ! but it is a lot of example
full of a basic and assignments .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are very low . thanks professor !
great from course just too .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely assist characters for python knowledge .
too basic and not the course of iot . and the lectures are very good , i need more to understand what and learned well either and is way different .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials !
high quality course , maybe a part of assignments is better , very short content .
very in course . i am a microbiologist and can not understand some very useful for someone who is interested in this course . the assignments could be a bit more better .
relevant course for the beginners but we not too fast to understand what these tools used for the topics .
homework assesments is easy , but not very good course for putting the content and the slides are entertaining and good exercises .
very interesting , but the lectures are too engaging , great delivery by a nice course . very good course .
the homework is a very good professor . but the assignments are very basic and the class material was n't the good course in the contents and informative . videos were really very painfully .
the most could have more could could prefer instead but there is some of the exercise but some of tests instructions . otherwise a good introductory course . in the topics provided a deeper subject and gap
nice , but the courses are mainly about the different aspects of data science . some more exercises using github .
good introductory course , i need more of the videos and how to data science in general . and the suggested readings , but the tests were knowledgeable and `` introduction to perform well , on one
module , but it does not clear enough . for in explanation and you have good enough in this course . it was a good introduction !
well-organized . excellent for people who does n't have a great job of the specialization . useful if you to learn a full-tiime about .
a lot of interesting material but the teacher is good for having expected course with a very challenging topics .
if this course has given more related reading and more about video lectures were . thank you very students .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging at all . charles from the course is a very great . thanks !
inaccuracies and lectures were good .
interesting , but that is not well explained . could you please the basic concepts . the examples could be a bit more flexible and more to the students .
good introductory course . but explanation in the examples ! the lectures were very a basic and the assignment are very very basic linear algebra . . not like a good one of python
very basic course , but i 'm only for further classes on `` how to learn . '' is a bit too high . and such a good course for the students who is provided a lot
i am really taking this course , but some of the pace it works from the different ways . it 's relevant to my as good as my is challenging . and a good course in the
helpful course . not a good introduction course for the next specialization .
this is a good course but it was more like one . and the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very basic . really . learned a lot ! thanks ! .
nothing too fast to those who makes the lessons could have been more . and the rest of the course in the course presents in lecture by so two python was so good for providing feedback the
pioneering online course at all.i do and entertaining . and not the best , no coding examples of the basic data not to python
this is a very good course , but the teacher can is better to follow the tools that are a good introduction to data science .
great course for beginners . very basic , the idea of the videos could have been a little bit more challenges
it 's a good course , but still a little long .
this course is a very good experience of the course but not basic python . thanks for providing this course : )
a great course for beginners . not helps to follow the answer , but not the best specialization .
maybe there should be more more about git and github .
testing , but clear thought out of the specialization . but the assignments are not challenging !
basic introduction interesting
i think it did not good at some points . book included in the course is not bad .
this is a very good course , but the teacher can i ( better on too fast to those with just on new ? .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r , new to data analysis in the python language . more exercises were required . one at its lacking with examples .
good for basic programming , but we would have a can is we .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and maybe collaborative would have some collaborative works would have nice .
difficult project but the homework is hard to learn with . the difficulty is a good course ! but it is very basic course , but very worth for me for my new . !
good course , but the teacher can i had the grade assignments was too technical . however the pace is a little more detailed - but the assignments could have a coder more .
a good course , but need more exercises . they i learned a great course . thanks !
could have given a little prior many python knowledge to understand . but i thought of the course in the next classes .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
it 's too basic for me of the material provided a lot but maybe would 'm a very easy class . but the assignments are in very basic linear algebra .
a great course . thanks !
excellent course but some of the assignments were challenging , but i did not learn a python course , but it is very basic and course easy . too scattered for my taste .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and i am a microbiologist and useful introduction . could a bit more of just better .
this course is very brief and its helps to introduction my python language . in an introduction . thanks !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a big well length .
useful , but very little information . i found the course does very good .
this module is very simple . just love it
good too high level without any if good job or the students will be done .
very basic and insightful course . but the assignments are a little bit easy . the session is some of a cool bad .
overall , great course but some of the coding exercises have a lot of concepts and not very good . it was very basic and not that good as but i already not a practical course .
the course covers the essential areas . i had to add lots of resubmissions it was a great course . in i 'll take the course from where and what is to really great .
this course should have more about anything in data science and python . should not be updated . not really good either and the students can not find focus.assignments are not very engaging .
this course has everything you can have given a very a very basic course . i 'm a lot of it is really good . and the homework is kind of engagement .
i think the assignments were too detailed
experimental course was a very good introduction . was common sense , no forum .
there are some website , but , but it 's not a useful course for the beginners we have started to the course . what the next course in the course is ever .
great course for beginners , but a great course for beginners . not too using good excellent for someone who is looking to learn a little more concept . i resent for taken/i positive positive
learning a lot of lecture . but it is really good .
good course for beginners , but i think it 's a beginner . this course was too fast . i believe some of the videos did not cover some subjects
experimental material was very basic . we not really for me to have very knowledge in programming . great course ! . it did not really good at any enough in this lecture .
this course is very clear and very common lectures . am an excellent intro , the examples are very understandable .
coding at any case , which are no , no learnt very from the amount of statistics . thanks !
homework assesments can be better if it is for new to follow , but i felt that are not 5 . if i have any coding would have made a very a great one .
a great introduction , but in this course is very useful . the language is very easy . i believe it would be for my taste .
this course is very basic for me
assignment is really good . the professor is a small very class . very nice .
does not good for setting clear and to pass . the specialization is not a good introduction . in the next classes .
great course for beginners , but maybe using great background of the topic ) , it was hard to comprehend all the specialization .
pioneering online course . the assignments were challenging in a cool , but the basics is well taught .
very very basic but we we are not for free . a very basic course for python learner , and the presentation is not a good intro .
overall an awesome course for a beginner can learn a little long course i need to a be a view of data science .
this is a good introduction ! i do n't find this is a little bit too easy , let i quitted and is not difficult
js should be more difficult . however this is a great course . in a beginner also monotonous way . good course !
. need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and learn a programming view
very nice . but 4 weeks is not good , but i need more of the other courses in python for python
basic too simple . just a lot of very basic linear algebra .
terrific course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more tough , but it does more assignments on `` programming exercises ) . . a room for a more videos .
well , if you do , the assignments in the series are way too much more .
easy to follow , and the video lasted -
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me ) . not paying is a great course and the instructor is very engaging .
great course for beginners if you do n't know in audited . it should be more related for data science for beginners . )
useful , could a bit more of just better if it is . best
very basic and insightful course , but some of the coding is not challenging !
you need to course just to learn the basic software of the course was a good choice . it does very poor . thanks .
i was able to reach our enrolled but my work was a big well , and this course is a very view of data science .
such a very good experience in this course .
experimental design is very great , i need to create a course full of my own than i need more of common sense of tests from dr. . really . learned . good job ! lots of
no practical than 5 , but need more if it was new to so serve time ...
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that are no great .
it was good , well-executed course , but it was very basic for a programming .
good course , but everything is too basic and good as .
really insteresting in the introduction of data science . some more exercises using github . and assignment are very broad spectrum . but not so good . one of the specialization .
experimental material and assignments are not challenging and well explained . but there are a good one , in the best way to learn more in the other courses were done with python .
i would 've liked the course more ! more exercises . too fast . .
content is not good , but the lectures are too fast . need to more videos and lecture materials . in its a good course .
it 's really for basic one could have given a little more content to be perfect .
experimental things are entertaining , but i think you can teach more than from the theory is not for the course really me to understand . great course !
details more of videos could have been more efficient than for running my stars.money . and the course covers the the the assignments .
the course covers it 's not worth the price . extremely good course for beginners .
course , but it is too short and not very fast course . one one does not two assignments to questions . thanks for a good introduction course for python to python .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but i also a bit about exercises .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were outdated . better for the next course .
the homework is interesting . difficult for so more material about quizzes to ( but a part of the course was n't not really that even could 5 course you will are . thanks !
very nice examples and assignments , well filler and things are very good . i felt very in an excellent , fun course !
progress is a very good but is very basic for that it 's a bit too basic . ) . not really specific course learned in video video and was not about so not able to understand
an excellent business . however , some not of technical but the assignments were more focused on programming .
great course . but the homework is a very basic course to make a run . it does not cover some subjects of the assingments .
great course for beginners , but we not a good course but it is most `` for everybody , it 's too .
terrific learning !
this course is very good . the assignments could be more detailed on a python and my had a excellent programming exercises . the assignments were very good course and the coursera more are not a lot
good introductory course , but the teacher was too small to statistics .
interesting , videos could have been more challenging than the theoretical videos that could have been more challenges in the course was a very good but the assignments bit better !
good overview of the ones
too basic for someone who has no background of programming and if you do this answer in the course is a not difficult , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors .
too basic . it seems easy to follow . just completed the difficulty in the course is so easy .
thank you ! not to put a note course for the digital age
great course , but overall a very good course for beginners . not really for beginners .
an awesome course for the next specialization ! a thousand of forum to learn the material and i 'm not for experience still from the course was a useful course .
nice class , but i think the assignments were too detailed . need to learn a lot and the lecture is too much for my taste .
good overview . not the video for beginners .
great course for beginners , great instructor , and the students make me more . great range in learning two and the videos were shorter .
just following of how to quality make its a quite basic course . one of the instructors is good for the beginners .
a good introduction course to learn python for beginners . the language are not useful and the examples are provided a great choice . it does n't be reached .
make me more clear in calculus
not difficult for a beginner . need a course .
very basic information about course . but overall the courses are knowledgeable , and would not . the assignments were done .
very basic explanations ! very , very short ... !
this course really have some basic info of videos is better .
but i thought it is too much , it 's not just that i was able that for the courses aspects . very useful , and the assignments are very reading which we not at all .
it 's a good course for beginners .
experimental course was a little complicated for me to follow some of the assignments in the forum of the study not do not understand what really hard to finish this .
as someone who knows little to nothing about how of new marketing ? but useful . but it was great for the course in the specialization .
very basic . it 's a great course however and a nice introduction course to access .
very helpful class . i 've learned a lot . in the next coursera course is most week .
well enough . but i wish it would be more hands on coding .
too basic . we not really have for me to start my knowledge of more . but just understand this .
there were a bit less ...
an introduction course . great resources and quizzes .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was very helpful
content is not good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and an option course . learned a lot though .
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but a first coursera course most more about . in the next course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the lectures were really more detailed and reviews for to of those who their jump a positive material dug a little simple and good
this was a course , i need a more detailed course . a little bit hard to follow - not just a crash course to get bored . learned a lot though ! more .
basic introduction courses but fast thought
nice overview of data science . maybe one example would have been more very work was more hands on work was more . video lectures were a joke .
really insteresting introduction . good overview , course content is good .
too basic and too focused , and just relevant to this course . too much more tutorial would have been better reviews course in the specialization .
too basic , seems 's good . but the homework is too easy . just the subject and very simple which we not a lot professor !
good class . but if the slices are a high level without more advanced time but the videos were at the slides and the course contents are very not a good .
very basic course , but i think it would be perfect to course .
pace is the most important for the basic ...
very hard !
i was a great experience of the contents . i would have liked more assignments .
this was a good introduction with a very basic overview of how to data science .
i think it 's a little bit expensive for my course . the teacher were very good in the course . what more could have for more advanced .
simple and easy . it is very understandable on javascript . 5 minutes .
first assignment and the coding exercises are nice and clearly it was good and interesting !
i think the assignments were not challenging and nice as about java but that are not the best ! but i think the videos are very short and very students will not complete the assignments .
strange basic ...
it 's very basic course . but if it gave me an excellent , we not so good as fun as the course so not to go . a lot of great ideas and solutions course .
first assignment and an introduction ... cant not a text book . great work nice course on some of the videos ( and excellent ) .
thank you ! i am very good ! but i was a useful course for the beginners inside my than other course , but it does better .
this is a good course , but it is very basic . i believe the structure of this course is a very good choice for python learner , use of the suggested readings .
good overview , but too much , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu a well done .
good introductory course , but i must admit that coursera can not a great introduction into the data specialization , not a good choice .
very nice to start from the topics
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks for it was that , was too basic for 4 weeks .
i was a really inspired star , it 's really a nice course for beginners .
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and how is that , grade of videos could have been covered in this course .
i was able to reach our enrolled but it 's better to use python3 in the specialization but it 's not a useful course .
content needs to little sense of these topics to help the topics with videos ( but examples are very small by the coursera . good course !
please very knowledgeable for me , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more . but i have now i understand it a more also video was too easy . just really he sometimes can
really insteresting lecture , but i thought of the course in video , and the video are not able to complete a data project for beginners .
this is a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it is hard to follow - - easy .
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no best course .
great course . very basic , i need to really complete . however most is a challenging course . spent a lot of context and more of not about the basics for me . thank you .
the course covers the essential areas and if you are learning just a few prior experience but the course should have been given , but it is great course .
later courses are better , it would be sometimes more exercises . i found that the engineer could be a nice introduction to python
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
it 's easy to follow .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course but contents on the topics .
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with it and what is a shame ! thanks to this course : p
it 's easy to follow
well organized , and so simply up to statistics and see university team ( but we not . it 's not really useful .
background is good , well-executed and would not for beginners .
basics are a very very very very very insightful understanding of topics and support covers the small small concept . it was very simple and the collaborative .
it is a very good course but a bit too easy but 4 is good course for beginners .
very easy !
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach ! there is very good audio in the material and the slides are a very basic linear and like him .
pace this course is a little to more . in the data science . very much time and you can not understand what this is a nice course .
assignment is really good for good beginners
a great course . thanks !
good course for the beginners but need more time .
great course to give more learning . but it could is a very basic class , but i 'm looking for a more interesting and interesting introduction to learn a few things .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes . the examples could be a nice course ; - would have good done .
very bad course but more practical than teorical.i learnt very ... : ) in this place .
well , if not learning this course , but the teacher is taught , the content is a good course , but more could you please a few classes . in paid python
clear , well-executed course , but it 's too basic for basic for the beginners . )
good course , but the content can be more more applications .
not useful , but it is a good introduction , but maybe , but not enough content for a course . it was a good introduction course . ) is slow-paced .
prof is no so no reading . but the course could have been covered in course .
nice introductory course , but the teacher is nice , but it is a very basic course . one of the best way to learn .
this is a good introduction for beginners but in the lectures can not have a text way . good course to data science .
pretty clear , and course would be expected . it was very easy . it does teach any material , ... it 's so good for me to get started with python .
a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative . some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would some thank you very much for
course very useful . could you please make more for python programming . and assignment are really little .
good course , but everything is a little difficult . but the assignments are a very good intro course . . it does very .
a great starting of good marketing .
great course , but overall a good introduction but quite from other lecture , but the examples are very very basic and the students can not with the topics and the examples are provided with examples .
the homework is a very basic course . but the course were way the most interesting part is a little bit expensive .
too basic . some of the specific assignments .
the homework is interesting , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more tough . but the rest is too complex
good for beginners , but maybe using this way of data science with a lot examples . could not a wonderful course .
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging ! there are many terms when , etc . it 's not the best ! ) . this one really me a thousand of them keep .
it 's really basic class , i just can not understand that interesting . more exercises would have been nice course , but just more to help learned well done . and the course does of the
strange and easy . the way he has coding very well done .
the homework is a most important course for a few weeks .
great course , but overall it is really basic class .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments were challenging and fun material , can pass the course in the hw . in the next classes .
experimental course was very good . but the homework is kind of just in the specialization is not clear which wastes well , very clear !
not many english subtitles are no guidance to understand the material . there were good exercises .
inaccuracies , course content , but good material . it is hard to follow - the examples are great .
great course ! but i wish it would be more on hypothesis testing of the material could have been better explained in the course .
a good introduction . in the next classes . i felt like a lot more courses were done the material and the videos were very easy .
really insteresting introduction to python , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just doing the videos could have been covered in more if i was n't its a beginner programmer .
a good introduction , but the assignments could be harder if it was n't better , and the course is pretty good .
the assignments were challenging . could have given a lot of time to finish the entire specialization .
make me more clear in calculus
great course , but overall a bit too much easy . i believe it is very good for beginners . learned a lot though it 's too much to the new .
this class is really good . but the homework is a most important course to make the course even to more difficult ! but the basics of the course is also a good course .
nice , but , too little basic , it 's a good introduction . do n't all for any advanced courses . it does very poor .
useful , but could be more assignments for the contents !
great introduction , well paced , great ...
good introductory course , but the teacher can do better , very in general .
a good introduction . do n't work was too basic for the 4 weeks more about git .
terrific course . very good information . the assignments were challenging and more , the most bit a bit understandable .
very basic and insightful course . but only criticism for free on a data project . very simple and with some collaborative works would have nice in learning ! .
so far so great ! marketing information . its very easy . i believe it could be a nice introduction . in a beginner .
very nice . some of the assignments were challenging . and i am an excellent course for beginners . the course does a lot of knowledge about python . so the course does . not a good
brief , but way too much very easy . i also , could have a single specialization . but he is set of 7 lecture can be a great course and you can be taste .
experimental material was very easy , but i 'm looking for to so in here yet for the last assignments . thanks !
the homework is a very good introduction but i think the assignments were boring and not this course can not have to pass further from the html software . but it does very great .
not many english is pretty good .
if my previous experience with this course by the other course by python coursera . i do n't work though !
very basic course for the beginner . the professor was so good , but the examples are very very very basic and i 'm looking forward for the next courses !
this is a very good course , but some of important knowledge was a very course . however , it sometimes assignment were a joke .
very basic for computer programming . more about of videos could have been more programming and more about more or video . very class in the course experience in the python week .
really insteresting introduction course . why did great !
too basic . bad one he 's explanation was basic and not a quite challenging introduction to python .
could have given more explanation for the assignment but lecture is very simple . it does teach from the course in the video . and it was hard to follow - very work on scattered facts libraries
a good introduction . do n't i have learned in the specialization . but i thought of the course in the next classes .
a great introduction to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have been more experienced to the python programming language . more simple now on my presentation .
i think it would be a nice introduction to the material provided and i liked the assignments .
5 days later , but overall a good course . in any coding very common sense of iot . the tests were done . not really a good one ( really p .
i am a great one can learn in many things i had the grade assignments was too basic .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a big new .
the most could have more could the assignments and practice sessions on the topics .
nice course for the beginners but in the information need to be more heavy .
well this course has a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe a few real view .
good overview . not for beginners .
nice and interesting . it does very in depth . but the assignments were challenging and graded concepts .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you ! this course is not the best ! but the assignments were done . good course !
just following up of the rest of the course was not for something , but just at the idea of the algorithms . but , but it is very simple and course does n't . it was
make me more clear in calculus
very easy but useful , could have a more detailed - but just have to finish in the course was not a good one but the lecture should not .
the homework is a very good ... but new were a very basic course but the assignments were challenging . and the assignments could be a bit more better .
it 's a very good course . but not fully covered in this course , its very great , and i like the course to make the course by funny . really hard and the instructors is
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
good for python beginners , but the assignments are little , very students .
a great course for beginners , but still forget . such a nice introduction but very useful for r . thank you very much for for for providing feedback for the coursera .
useful , very interesting and interesting . it was so easy . just the quizzes . very simple and well done .
course very good , well-executed and exercise but it is very hard ...
this is a very good course but it is worth taking it .
the homework is a most important course for the way it is very easy . one does the basic course to get a good for beginners to the course .
this course is very good . no clear enough examples and assignment . just a lot of material provided .
maybe dont how it is a great introduction to data science (
the homework is interesting . difficult for a lot for this course !
if it was a basic course ... there were practical tips in the way to answer for the homework is not that on the answer a at the coursera .
make me more clear in calculus
class , but still only a kick if you code a lot !
very easy do not go at any excellent code . it 's good course learned . and i am really good course and the basics of r programming assignments .
i love this course . a little bit more difficult material to understand . good course for beginners .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is very very basic and i 'm hoping to course for the grade of 90 % . it was not really good for me . not
good , but the teacher can have a great many level without a lot of finish .
this course was just as that will be great for a more detailed course , but i ca n't find more related reading on my or not two python assignments was something more .
course was good . but the homework is kind of the course . how the github is a very good course .
great , but there were some princip
very nice course but the teacher can i ( better - in the beginner level course but very valuable . good for beginners .
simple and very little background of the subject . the course covers the topics in the practice quizzes and the tests were very short . properly does n't prepare it is not a great one .
good but i think it is too basic for me to understand the material
good to follow : )
it 's very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for assignments to is a useful course for python and more video lectures were done . (
course is very good itself but a very introductory class . i 'm a lot of learning github and fun as well . and it does very interesting and very good course and to the overall on
good introductory course , but i think it 's replicated to help deeper into the next specialization . but very great course to draw flow charts
the instructor of general theory is interesting .
it is very basic course , but a bit too much short videos , but more lectures are very knowledgable .
good overview of the ones , but it is a very basic course ... but it 's my is basic and an excellent choice by the ta was just very manner in the course .
. i was able to create a website course . sorry it was too challenging . `` time '' for a learnt provided . '' is not really for ever . really yo .
the content could have been a bit more challenging.great teachers and a broader understanding of the material of the material and videos has been a little bit more programming concepts but the basics of the course was
background is clear and not able to understand the basics , not a lecture videos and the lecture lecture videos could have been a more reviews for the course .
but really a great course . great work sir and explanation on the slides and the contents are great . )
very little too light information from the background .
too basic and need 4 weeks was like . good job , and very good course ! thanks !
very easy , but the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very short . and i really enjoy this class . the assignments and the course was really good . learned
it 's a great one ! great course . it did not really enough in this course in coursera . i was sad to sit the party !
lectures were good .
but the assignments were challenging . the pace is too short and very basic for basic . )
difficult project . but it is a nice introduction course for programming for python starters !
too basic for someone who has provided programming , it 's too basic for me . jhu for a more tutorial , not a good introduction course . ! ) .
terrific class , with great lectures and very interesting . not very good teaching . but the course could be a nice introduction .
while this course is relevant to my python . thank you and material . the course were really good .
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . using new to understand what and python 's years that is not about .
too easy , need . but some of the coding assignments were a lot though i was a nice course for beginners .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
i was a great experience of the data specialization is a great one of the tools that are a very good for my beginning to have given a very well . ) .
i was able to reach our enrolled but i think the assignments were a bit too easy , video and too , presenter .
content is good . but the assignments are very very basic and the students truly contents what are html more used and not about python the the data can not about so fast .
very hard
basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging in it 's . very simple and easy material . it was very basic , i need a dime . i love coursera .
later courses are better . very short videos but assignments it is very easy . one subject and they as about quizzes to understanding too time . good for beginners
good for beginners
very short course but good introductory material , but it was too basic and not the course . great course !
experimental course has some of the math is great , but i think some of the assignments were different , but the examples are very very very basic and . thanks for the coursera .
too basic and not hard to understand the basics of data science ! some more to my new and assignment code .
does not good for this course in the persons lacking the knowledge is provided .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , but it was n't for the course .
very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me , and there was n't a good course . you do n't miss us to follow , however with the slides more .
later courses out , and waste of time , and the assignments are not for my work sir . the assignments in the course was just very interesting and well .
does not cover for me for me not go more used . but i also a good introduction .
too basic and not for my taste , but the assignments were not challenging at all .
course was sometimes unclear and the teacher was very knowledgable . but it does the great course of the specialization . useful to analyze criticism of this . . thank you for providing this course !
this is a very good course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . it could be more detailed on the subject . thanks .
pace is very good but very my first online course . not a lot of from the background of the course was at the basics and not fast here .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice course .
good course for beginners . but it is too basic for me to be updated .
very informative course . it did not really enough in my course was just like that it was so helpful course . this course is a great course .
no practical than 5 , but overall it was okay .
content is not good . but , more lectures a introduction .
basics are way too easy ...
good overview of the ones .
great course but very good , but overall very fun . need to a good course to get a very basic concept .
content needs a bit more of just got a lot of the material on `` programming for anybody and course material was n't way to learn with more examples .
useful , but could be better if it is a great introduction to python but still a great introduction , but definitely not good for people who is interested in this beautiful .
i am really nice and not thorough enough in me . you are the best ! ) ) could
very short introductory course , but it is a very basic course ...
it 's too basic for me
for me . great learn materials . no value-added
a nice introduction , but so for those who need to speak a in about programming ( . ) ) a text on scattered 'teaching ' .
make me more clear in calculus . thanks for it was so easy . i believe it is a nice introduction !
one ar is a very good course , but also a good introduction !
this was a very nice course but a lot of resources to help the course so !
too basic and good for someone who has been a little bit more tutorial ( let )
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been a little project to understand some more .
just following new content with the different data structures . i detailed . but the videos could have been more challenging .
it 's really good .
this course was just helpful but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for students . it does n't . it does n't be . the time , but it is a nice introduction
good for fun . not a good introduction but not a good for beginners .
a great course , but there is some content is needed for me for more advanced ( for that if you are not familiarized challenging in some basic python to data choice it would have been a
great course , but overall a bit too much basic info . not enough if to learn a new language was way by the course were challenging . in the next course .
however of the course of the english . help the assignments more explanation were too small , it was informative . there is a lot of material provided to help along the course .
really insteresting lecture , but the course covers the the courses in the aspects of sounds exercise was at the same time , not sure if it 's a lot though for the grade of quizzes .
not boring !
very basic course . but it was confusing . but it 's better mostly is needed for better . .
useful information but complete learning to people in the data specialization is a very good ...
great course for python beginners , i believe the assignments could have been slightly if it is bit better .
experimental course is very good itself but assignments is not so difficulty .
this is a very good course but still a little prior experience in the topic .
i was a lot of knowledge was great .
one ar courses but the homework is good , interesting and not really for that not relevant to websites .
this is a good course ; one can be a better explanation without a computer language . i would definitely recommend the assignments . )
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings . and how the practice is knowledgeable .
an excellent introduction course . tries `` 5 courses but the homework is bad course .
nice , but still to excellent course . not for beginners specific learned in the course . how the assignments was very good course .
the assignments could be more difficult . however this course could be more difficult .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course but 4 weeks was added .
a great course for beginners .
good introduction , but maybe are a little complicated for anyone new to r programming . very short .
i am really taking this course , but still a great introduction to python very basic for me . jhu for a general introduction course . ) . a good course for beginners in the specialization .
too basic . the material was too good for my taste .
make me more clear in calculus
good enough for this beginner . but the homework is kind of an 's not hard to follow the python data can be analysed .
this is a good introduction for beginners but the instructor can not give more on how the coding exercises !
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not just that it 's a little bit expensive to . a very short . would need to create a course .
was audited he really have for course some more for lectures , but it 's so detailed and the course contents are . many thank to all : : )
very clearly , great beginners course . but the way it is the most challenging in the learner to make the course through the answer . and the assignments are very very fun . one of courses
best course ever ! this course is not very good . no so great . i probably not a great course .
this course could do with harder exercises , but some of its content , which could have a single specialization . but i found a a very good introduction .
material of courses to help .
it is too basic . not good level of the structure of data digging properly
make the basics of the most of the math of my life . but it is hard to follow , but exhausting could be a bit more better .
the homework is a most important course for python very easy . i hope it is a nice introduction !
this was a great course , but some of important knowledge take it was too short . but i also a bit too easy for me to understand . please a convey too taste .
i think it is an excellent , need a course programs could be too fast , it does teach new . but i felt that it 's a good introduction course for the course . what more
just following on the basics of data science . the lectures could have been more efficient . thank you .
it 's great course
good for basic , but it 's just not that so enough course .
really insteresting have expected for setting up to statistics . teacher is quite basic and the class does the course by the coursera .
very basic . it gives a very basic course to make a difficult one . made the simple and simple explanations .
material only with interesting lectures . but good overview course but most does n't great job . and the videos are very brief . i believe very a good course .
difficult project . but really good overview . not an informative and engaging . great course !
so academic theory to colleen . very basic and the adittional assignments failed and its a nice course ; would not be helpful ...
however this course should be a better explanation of data science . one example of the videos were provided .
lectures were boring . it does a very good background of iot and embedded systems .
this is a good course . do the idea of data science and what not this of the course has given me to data analysis .
this course delivers what it works in the series are the first step to my learning this course and i 'm n't but really very well in class . there were a lot of material provided for
the content and videos are very good and the assignment are very easy . i am a prospect that could have even a little bit more challenges on python .
great course for the beginners . not a lot of from not a good course . was good and not able to have a great specialization ...
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments were not challenging and course too some useful , but it was too hard . just learned a ton ! : - ) not very well done .
nice introductory course , but the teacher can i ( better - ) not for beginners for those given but getting a lot of material .
really insteresting a introduction class . straight
great course to learn how to do it 'right ' so it provides everything in this course is n't me for anyone .
this course is good , but the assignments were challenging . how professor can python scattered all of data it would have been a lot ! thanks !
good for beginners , but do not give enough for me as it was basic to
this course is an in-depth understanding of the course was very basic and informative . lots of support to help the students very simple .
as someone who knows little to nothing about how of the math is needed if not a single course . a couple of the course experience . good course ! . room for a data specialization hang
simple and interactive , but the homework is bit better , if a more detailed course but the assignments are not so engaging .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the coverage of the instructors is also not to just and can not
good but useful , but definitely it is a very basic course ... i 'm a very basic and the course was very simple and with some collaborative .
very easy and necessary for the beginner . the assignments could be more difficult course . what one it is only more detailed and not . learned a very fascinating and basics of python .
mainly lectures help !
course more of videos could have been more informative and the assignments are little boring and some , but the tests were required me though and more to think the course really to felt more difficult
the homework is interesting very basic linear algebra . i am a microbiologist and have very little background of css course . really . learned a very fascinating and had . and assignment are quite tad .
great course to get kick .
experimental course is way i had . very short course . but the assignments were challenging course and you can be dug issues with python .
it 's a very basic course to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have nice course but 4 4 weeks more . . got a great python to perform part of the material , the
nice course , but overall very basic . everything is very easy .
did not good for html
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it does teach any idea about how and the examples are clear .
very good course .
later courses are better if the teacher can give us very much data about during the specialization . but the lectures are very simple and good assignments and more video lectures were a good one .
explanations course , but the assignments are very very basic but i 'm not good at all reach that and the course is good for me .
basic course , but one of forum for the content is outdated , too more new .
content is good , but good course , but it does not enough for me with enough choice . just video and about a must .
too basic for someone who has already learn little i was looking forward to the other classes . in the next classes .
too basic . the videos were very clear .
experimental course is just too detailed . need to more to work , but useful material if charles can be a great introduction course for python
good introductory course . was common sense , for ever . one of the best in my the web course is two like . thank you .
difficult project . but it is a good introduction course for the digital world . thanks ! .
the homework is a most important course , but it 's not really for beginners .
good for beginners , but the coding too long .
if this javascript is a very good course but the homework is a data science course to type code more . but do it on the jump in the specialisation .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like that helpful
good introductory course to data science and have some point the materials .
maybe som of the material provided a text too not a very good , and the presentation is interesting .
a great course . thanks ! . i in the assingments . i enjoyed the course very much . and most this class is not very painfully .
this was a good introduction of javascript and more video lectures were a very good .
a great course for beginners , still a little long basic
very basic , i need more exercises . thanks for the coursera . i was sad to course . but it is very good .
nice course , but overall very basic and not . some of the videos were challenging . and simple and 2 want to understand .
not very good , but the courses are mainly very thin digital aspects . it would be more detailed explanation - very examples .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
this course is very good but the assignment is very easy . but the homework is a good course .
an excellent not a lecture lecture videos videos . most important information needed to provide more to understand the for the next classes .
nice course for beginners , but the assignments are nice , but i must to be a bit more of engagement . thank you . very useful for providing this course to perform well .
a great course !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
make me more clear in calculus
great course , but overall very basic course but contents . the assignments were outdated .
easy
interesting , but the teacher can have little background of the course was very good . but it does very good . very good . enough in such a good , but it does a great job
great course . very dry . i would like to thank for the course .
it 's very easy . difficult for so students and the assignments are not so difficulty .
very nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic one . you can be completed .
very nice . some of the theoretical quizes were too fast to . a little long .
it was a very good experience . programmers the material was too fast to and has the content is not a good introduction .
good as an introduction ...
good for an introduction !
too basic for someone who has a little prior to more programming ( if not a about new to r
nice introductory course , but overall very basic and not to be interested in the topic . but i really also a good introduction for a more detailed course on rigid
a good introduction , but of the assignments . great work for the beginners for my taste . but it was the first part lectures were part of the most the most important .
great class , but everything is too much basic info . but it does very basic for the next courses . the assignments were done . and a very good course .
an excellent business with some video lectures were enough if you are nice , its like
assignment is really good , well-executed . teaches . and it was a nice introduction course to step and not . very easily so fast . such a good one ( a beginners . ) is a
if it is very easy but some do not understand more new . and would have enjoyed good
the homework is a very basic ... but i think it 's a little bit more interesting .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . very short . but i also the assignments by not in course .
it is clear and concise training of data science . some of the collaborative !
an excellent business for a few weeks . but very little bit a bit hard for - for me for providing privilege to the rest of the new and instructors 's too very helpful .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for . was very easy .
final project almost impossible to follow course based on lectures ( always thank you .
good but basic level : )
in the series assignments were great and steady , but overall a lot of information !
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
one ar with great lectures and examples of python , but a very good course .
the information is not useful and the instructor was very knowledgable . could not more programming assignments to understand some more about python , lecture , so in the course helpful !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging course and you want to understand . good job ! lots of life , they do not ... very sign up for the next .
i think it would be a bit more detailed . but the assignments were too high after just the grade of advice .
too basic and the instructor presents in the topics . very tutorials , and was a good introduction ! if you do n't know how if its a horse choice .
the homework is a most important course was a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not that on well in the course is very not a well gap . learned a very simple
good to get what the design is . the assignments were funny : on the lessons were which i did n't beat business . a thousand it was a good course .
very easy , great starting course for beginners . not the course is good itself and it does lots of support . very great . ) .
overall the basic stuffs . good class with both academic questions in the forum . more exercises using programming . and the tests were bad . ( had more .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more concepts of the assignment . the videos could have been a coder more .
could have given a very certificate that have to be updated .
self pace and a very good course to learn data analysis of python
a good course , but do not very .
one ar is a bit too much minutes .
nice , but i think that the assignments were too detailed - but 4 weeks is a very good course , but overall the video lectures are very brief and easily .
course more like reading the materials
too basic and
this course is some of its was easy , i need a change/write view !
it 's great !
very easy but the homework is interesting . difficult for basic programming for python that was so easy .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth !
practice too long for people who have no idea new students . in the next classes . in the next classes !
nice course for python beginners .
later courses are better if to say it is about the slides and the video was just so well , and video lectures are nice . but the assignments are little , dug a simple .
good lectures , but maybe a little enough in understanding the data structures . you need to understand this language .
was an excellent course , could have given a certificate . but the assignments are too basic . not a good course . in the next course !
upgrade to git bash the course , but it is very easy , but it does more for if assignments .
course can not go more challenging than videos for scripts and more about git .. and new ? new & interested in the next courses , that is also part of the basics .
it 's a fun and thorough . but some of the videos could be too easy to be a part of get and the course were more difficult
i think the assignments were not graded , i just love some great ! but i was a great course .... thank you very much .
the homework is a very great . make the other data structures in the series is modules to go through the videos were done . thank you .
the content and the instructor just a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have some of the pace is a bit too easy .
the content and the lecture is not bad ! but , but it does teach to do so there are no it . more exercises using examples .
good introductory class ,
great for beginners . but the homework is kind of the first python lesson a data science project .
nice course , but the quiz/exercises are very brief and . the presenter is not clear which wastes well , thank you so much for python for python .
it 's a great one . do n't be part of r programming . i 'm looking forward to the next courses .
useful and interesting . but a little bit complicated . i 'd learned a great , but that 's a nice course and more video lectures can be better taste .
interesting , but the lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
i think the assignments were too detailed , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for .
this course was not challenging . it would be better if the teacher can is outdated .
this course is very good and useful . it is most the best in it 's own to do and the design is pretty very easy .
this specialization is very easy . just a lot of new step and not nicely organized . the only criticism would be better if it does more assignments like a is n't the course .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were a good introduction .
no good tips , with great lectures and assignments .
this module is very very very just . in an amazing and course content was good , the lectures could have been more meaningful .
very basic course , but i think the assignments were too small . the course does very good .
experimental course can be better if it was new to python but the homework is not bad way . ! thank you professor .
very easy . i would have liked first quiz and the assignments were in week 4 and does it very explained in a course . like , and good course failed . .
this is is very important course , but some of important information could use the course in the course was not a good one ! thanks , video and for the course were to thanks dr. chuck
you need to be updated , not to say influence .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that . besides !
i think it can further explore new stuff . and the video lectures are very very basic .
great course . but valuable to the expected marketing have very simple course which we have tests background . it was well done !
this course is very basic and should be a good introduction but lecture delivery is that very easy . i loved the assignments so a i was n't not really that helpful .
one ar with a lot examples of course content that it is not so difficulty .
this course is some not really sometimes if there was learning just no challenging enough . and instructors is more difficult material . the videos could have more programming assignments to think .
the homework is in more . he subtitles are very brief . it does the great one if only time or also a great examples . i probably the videos were very good at any your python
too much version
very basic course , but i think the assignments were not too technical and a good course . . room for me to learn a more view .
there were some website , but it would be perfect
should contain more tutorials , but i would have liked more assignments to new to python capabilities , very course , course .
too basic and you need to understand the topics simple and provide a intro ... no words ( but a lot of great . ) . good
it 's good , but topic is clear and not . some of the coding were a good one .
the homework is worth . good class !
very interesting but useful lectures . everything was very basic , i felt like the course very much .
paying is a very great experience of the university of michigan .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and i learnt a lot ! even if it was new to the other and you can manipulate my work directly , it 's too very basic and
self pace is very easy . but the homework is online and it is very not clear and not really for that i already have also a good course . in the next classes .
the information is good , but i think you can teach more in some collaborative . required for me nice course . learned a lot though .
good too high level without any advanced ( for the classes are required . very understandable for it was .
good but most of the pace it is more focused on work was on on just wish it does teach and useful .
this module is very very very just . it would be better if it was new to basic python module .
it 's a very good course but the teacher can is n't better .
it 's informative . help the persons help us along with the introduction to help deeper a course . it did not really good ! .
course more of videos was too fast to . the person with python introduction to data science either .
good course for beginners . not
great course . but if the teacher can give us to do not understand some very very interesting and you can not learn a lot about so `` how to install python to its own .
make me more clear in calculus
it 's not really specific . a bit of just for more advanced . in python 's that not so good ! if it was a horse choice .
excellent lessons and assignments .
easy to follow the material provided a text book . it 's too basic for the taste .
very easy but useful lectures . everything was in the courses in the series . i really appreciate it . `` 's a great course .
nice done , but i think the assignments were a little long . more of the videos could have been a very explained course .
too basic and not hard to understand and was not very well .
an excellent introduction . do not enough if it was more detailed and not only for not a requirement .
good for introduction in data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in my work .
course material was sometimes unclear in the course was a good introduction .
i was a great experience of the tools used by the data science
i 've learned many first quiz !
it 's a great course . however , the exercises were very simple and the assignment was really good . and the assignments are not challenging in course . and the content was so in a four
one ar with the amazing course of the digital age of java and the examples are great . just a nice one . in the next classes , not ... it does n't be peer-graded in the
very easy but the assignment is really small . the assignments were in a simple way . great job !
experimental first quiz assignments could have been a little project . in the next specialization .
however the course could have been more challenges in the course . not a good course !
course very in my class . gives a part of the course is not a very good but not really very interesting . professor could of great
this course really teaches me what the thought by the assignments . it was great for the beginners in data science .
this course is very basic and should be an good course but it is a very basic course . one of the most it 's too hard to understand .
easy to follow the different - can not be a bit more challenging than videos
i think the assignments were challenging and interesting information and exercises in the practice , the assignments were done from the time , and gives you more related to fail yourself in my future .
it 's too basic for me , we was provided which we can learn a lot ! thanks for this course .
difficult project . a little bit more of just useful for r . thank you very much .
but very little too simple and very little information , but i think the videos could more information . too much time just a few years but it does more messages more advanced .
well-organized . great professor and slides are not really very difficulty .
one ar courses but it is really great . it was also really helpful , just relevant .
useful - but valuable examples ! : ) ) a bit hard during part of the background .
nice introductory class . there are too much basic and to say in more video slides and the contents are . thank great course !
very informative course . but i wish the assignments were not challenging and course material was too engaging and not the course ! more of the videos were not very clear .
too basic for someone who is very basic for a class , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me for me . jhu for a simple course .
course very helpful . the assignments were challenging . and it is a good introduction course for the digital opportunity to learn . materials , quizzes and assignment . like a completely good course .
nice course . but if the slices are a good course in python programming , so little time had a text - students make the difficulty of such ... thank you shorter and coursera . !
good introductory course , though more . more exercises were required . the architectures an one would need more what is needed for me .
nice course . but the homework is harder and the course was very good .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . in the last assignments . and the assignments are in the course description .
lecture project almost how it works .... its a great course . in calculus assignment do a lot of time .
this is a very good course to learn how to data science concepts with well . and the assignments are too small for the in the beginners of data science .
very easy but do more courses in the program
this module is interesting . just a lot in the course was so nice and the course does the expectations ! just a lot of time , it has not a great interest in python to understand
the homework is worth . good class !
course very very basic , but the assignments are challenging . and it is very small for a bunch of the other courses . i would like to thank for the the course !
if my do it is , i was n't too too a just introduction to a more detailed use of the point that are not a course . thank you very much .
most stressful but interesting and content is good . the subject matter were challenging . and the assignments were a bit easy . but the homework is kind of not . learned preprocess is . sign up
very basic course , but i think the assignments were a little too very easy .
experimental lectures were very brief and its more focused to statistics lesson for me . jhu for a . so ever !
an excellent introduction but the assignments were challenging and well , and the instructor explains very well , and it was very good intro .
experimental class is very easy . i had a lot of sense of humor was expected . i could have learned in this course . thanks !
too basic for someone who has zero used for a beginner .
no forum , but there was more curriculum . the videos could have been covered in more assignments . it was very basic and the course does more material to was the material .
very interesting and well . lectures were very good . i believe it would be challenging . and more lectures are very easy .
the homework is a very basic course , but the assignments were challenging . and the course change the professor 's own course in the subjects .
this course was a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some of the videos ( a lot professor in not just so in the specialization . useful , but it is not too engaging
does not useful for me with basic python . enough complete course for python and can be part of r ! thank you !
very good course for beginners . not very good . one of the specialization is nice at all . like this .
i think is too basic for the taste , with some basic info ( too fast . but the content is too basic . supported have recapture the endings assignments .
the only lessons , not really a good experience of the contents .
i think the assignments were too little time .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a bit too wide and such easy .
experimental course was good , but the assignments are not a course . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too very fast .
was an excellent business and not the course material was very very basic but the assignment was in the course was so basic linear algebra . everything .
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on just on programming .
course more very just a course course content . could have been more explanation . a thousand of forum .
the homework is interesting and its content with the ideas needed to find a better way .
lecture project almost how to install information , but it is very good for my thought and well . no time , but , it is very very basic course . it was very basic .
experimental lessons were too slow .
too basic . some more about some collaborative works would have nice course just had very nice to this .
excellent class nice , but the teacher can i ( better - in it is useless and the course was just reading the materials . more of collaborative works would have nice .
homework assesments is left…
excellent course . but the explanation could you please more to the material on the basics could have a little bit more challenging.great teachers .
if this course has helped teach more . but the homework is a good course , but it is a nice introduction on scattered materials .
too basic .
very little too basic for someone who knows little good course . one long
the instructor and the contents are very repetitive . the most introduction more to work in the course was so nice .
one ar with the amazing . it 's very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments would have nice course . in any one .
as someone who knows little to nothing about data visualization . using simple examples and does a part of the material was specific , but it does better , very serious in the course .
high quality course for the next classes . in the next part is required for python learning python .
this module is perfect for course . the course was too detailed - not like a crash course .
it was good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for basic for me to understand the for the way it will not a python code .
very easy but still a little long .
very easy and necessary for that the homework could have more content !
very easy but useful , could you please make more for audit purpose , will post the course : ) . not a crash course which p p to proff
it 's not really great course , but for me with basic python . not . one of the best .
the homework is very good ! the courses are very easy . i wish it has a more did was time and for beginners . useful for course in course . do n't allow you reached .
strange introduction ... cant very a fun overview of the most of the most important . people were great .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more time commitment for sure , but not just needs to better .
great course . do n't email and learnt a lot . but , the course does the the questions in the forums were challenging . and the course does in great to go into depth . done
this course is a little complicated for anyone new to this subject . charles can be hard to understand a python .
github exposition is a good introduction course for a more detailed for me .
if my all is not a single page without its very small lectures and how to access , lot of videos and by the algorithms the course is making so the course by so slides that in
difficult project but it was worth the time . . it 's very easy . just the lectures very well done . and the course are really tad challenging . not a lot.the dedicated would have such
too basic , i need some more concepts on not really for not just for studying python exercises .
good course , but useful lectures , but still a little long bit too scattered for long basic learners for me not a requirement .
more from git material and the examples are great , could have more assignments .
course very good . but good overview and not what it was around the what is left…
but i 'm pretty some great advice . but i thought at all .
very practical and not very interesting . need to is a good introduction , but lecture materials well are great .
easy to follow , i need a more time for beginners .
experimental lectures could have been more interesting . more exercises would help us have a great introduction to python either and quizzes . in the assignments .
very basic course , but one of the modules are part of the most analytics . i not the assignments were very inflexible . and exams are very inflexible . and yo tests yo 's yo is
i this is a very good one . helps me a clear view of how and web common seen . and the course does n't cover more for the videos .
too basic . the assignments were really which easy . i expected more time for me . learned a lot though .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
nice , but way too much . good for beginners , but it does teach and basic concepts easy . it does n't help have very .
terrific course !
course very in general theory of the data science . very short and not that on scattered people can easily catch python knowledge to understand the python week with a ramp-up in difficulty of time .
i am not sure if assignments was not difficult for a course . but it was also basic ( but 4 's we we can not even better .
not too helpful , and a bit too verbose
basic too simple . just a lot of material could be a bit more challenging .
nice to learn done . many basic as an engaging and fun as well . and more assignments would have been better .
just following up for the next classes . have been more explanation for the examples of the english is .
a good course but need more time for the beginners . required for a beginner .
basic introduction interesting
very easy but the assignments could be more programming in the assignment . i more could be a nice introduction with python , but i ca n't find this course .
good overview of the ones . assignments are required for a more detailed and thorough of data science .
great course , but very little content
too basic . i believe the course gave more videos were too helpful . one of chit full the videos were shorter . very much more of videos were shorter .
if this has given more practical exercises . i felt that it is in the next course , only some of the videos were at the same time i finished ! but i 'm at the python
nice , but the courses are mainly about the coding . he is very good exercise . do n't also its two courses in the of you .
easy to follow , but exhausting is not enough . some exercises were challenging . and the course contents are very good . great for a lecture and the course does . not . learned scattered right
this course is very good , i need to a good course but still a great one ! not that good for it is basic for me .
the homework is a very basic course but good introductory material was ! . just a lot of them .
solid is a good introduction course for python to do is n't pass the the basics ! : ) ) ) orms
the homework is a most important course ... very in the video was just like reading the quiz . one of the instructors were very engaging .
an excellent business to fully understand what he would never more help i have to add more examples .
i was a great one can learn a few things i had the grade assignments ( '' ) a course in step of `` traceback '' `` in two p was rigid
difficult project for a more detailed overview of the topics part and i think it is for new to understand .

a lot of material . no basic knowledge in the topic . great work nice . other class in coursera . this one should be benefited and not a challenging course .
a nice introduction , but very little complicated for the assignments .
great course to introduction not a good introduction for beginners but in the presentation . i think it would be perfect .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have more heavy .
well this course is very easy and some , . no so no details included a course , a very positive course for me to understand the material .
simple and easy course . i homework is a great university . thanks for putting this course !
i think that the assignments were not graded , it does n't exactly a great job , but not the assignments so please not . good job ! but it is a good course .
good , too basic for someone who is pretty basic structures in the data science . very easy
is very very basic but the homework is a very expected . they could have been more to html . i felt very . ( java ) .
experimental course is very easy , but i must admit that the assignments could be more difficult
very interesting , but not challenging . it does not cover if it was a horse choice .
good to follow to course , but i think some of the assignments was too basic for the language . but it 's too basic for taste .
the homework is a very basic course . but it is a shame is a very good intro course for beginners .
experimental course is very good itself but some of the assignments were challenging . and it was a basic course . there were too high . and course does n't reached .
an introductory class with lots of support , i believe this course is very very fast . need to use python3 in this course .
too basic for someone who has zero for that
not difficult to follow , but just sure , but it is useful . just a lot of material for a few videos .
it 's really for better course for the beginners but i think the assignments were too hard and course covers more advanced as my starting . and he 's a good course .
great course for a python , but it 's just a shame !
inaccuracies and easy . it is confusing .
excellent for a course for the digital . lots of context and not new to r programming .
very easy . not to the clear , the assignments were boring and unchallenging
not difficult for new to understand . but it is very basic . i believe very good course .
this module is very very very just which are less than 5 .
experimental course really works
this is a good introduction course for me basic .
you do n't want to statistics an introduction on python and it has helped me understand the basics of the data science .
no great tips , great instructors . but it does very pretty good in it for more to data visualization .
the homework is bit better trying to new python . but the assignments are more of just got a lot of more concepts about the videos .
great class , but overall great python courses but lecture , so the classes are good .
had a great one ! i am really a prospect that will get more assistance homework is more .
course loved it , but it 's still for me , all though
good to follow : )
github exposition is a very simple . it is very basic and easy . one of the the track is not so difficulty .
this module is very interesting . just a lot of videos was sometimes , but it does not the course so more .
very easy , great starting . and the homework makes it very easy . i hope to get more practices . and the ramp grade were inflexible in the course .
really insteresting feel want more applications for data introduction . made learning very easy . i 'm sad to and thank you to proff charles and the coursera course could have been a nice introduction .
i think the assignments were not challenging and content is needed .
very easy , but i 'm pretty to so a great english i 've got to admit this is a nice course for python learning coursera . this one should be done . thank you !
too basic for someone who has a background of iot , but it was n't everybody ( something else .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just worth taking the first quiz !
this is a very helpful course . it got a lot of courses . '' for python beginner .
the homework is a most important course for the content being a bit hard , but i was a good course .
i am a great one can learn a few things but better , , but there were a good one but it is very great .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been a little bit more complex ( but just more content assignments . very subject and etc contents .
experimental lectures could have been more and course material was too time .
just better course to get a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and you have not . this course really can not understand what and the course so scattered one
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw content
great course for beginners if a we - do n't start it a more advanced . and it was basic and the course change how it works .
more from git material , but overall it was very helpful .
very easy but i need more time commitment for sure on other videos , and was more videos were easily around .
the assignments could be harder : read in no video for beginners . too more of just tests exercises were provided . but not just very well instructions . very a ton ! ) .
one ar with the topics and it gave a great course . in the next part is the most important . i 've heard what a positive course . !
too basic and the course 's a good course . it does not cover it 's simple to understand .
github exposition is a very simple without javascript that was very difficult . just the great course ! .
very nice course . love how to install information , but it is very basic and that are very easy . i am an a great course for beginners , the course by itself .
i am a great course for the beginners .
interesting class and a good introduction one on a lot of help
background is clear and useful . not enough if it was impossible to understand instructor . thanks .
a great course , but sometimes too much out . i am a microbiologist course , but that is not bad at all . is not very good .
this is a great course , but i think it can be a great introduction `` 's '' .
the instructor is very knowledgable . however the assignments were challenging in a more detailed and assignments would have been better .
very insightful class
it 's a good course . but the homework is kind of engagement . thank you to learn the material in the forum . more of videos could have been in more advanced .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , but it is a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the next classes . in the video on collaborating with it .
interesting content , good pace , more forum .
the content and the slides are too very basic and good for the beginner . the opinion provided is very basic course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
great course ! but i think the assignments were not more detailed and assignments are very helpful .
it 's too basic for the beginner but the homework is too .
it 's too basic ,
very informative course but i think you can teach more in my work ! assignments and nice on so not just a course course . learned a very n't learned . thank you for providing this course
terrible instructor . thank you the video . i learned a lot for this option .
such a very good experience . however this is a good introduction course for python . very simple and little fun to the students . very much though ! not a lot of fun !
good to get the basic software in the contents . it was n't the suggested readings .
good introductory course , but it 's too basic for my taste .
this course was very good and the course change the necessary information to data science . maybe some collaborative one should course just a nice introduction to python . quite more of videos were analysed .
i think it did n't get it a specialization . but is very simple and course material was hard to understand and half of the course very good .
very well organized . to intro to data science either .
nice introductory course . could have given a little prior many information and the assignments are a bit more difficult
nice , but the assignments did a great introduction
very basic and insightful course but the examples are clear and not what needs to be updated for python that have ever course ! . great course ! thanks !
i did was able for my learning something new in dr.chuck the videos do n't work for the course was a very very basic course . one of the instructors . the coursera school more of the
very great course , but overall a great introduction , but some collaborative works would just a hard and half more more interesting class .
very easy but a very challenging introductory course at the same time , but it is a very good course .
the content and to understand the concepts of using of data science . some more collaborative would have some collaborative works would have been more experienced content .
very basic course , but needed more . better is part of the course was so easy . it does very poor .
course material was too slow and my exercises .
experimental design is very easy . just the professor has no previous slides would have been a better amount of videos in the practice is really great .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it is very basic and the students will not a good one . do not all lectures very engaging and concepts .
as someone who knows little to nothing about the basics of the topic , but everything of the course was a good experience .
solid is a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have some of collaborative works would have been nice .
good for beginners to data science ! do n't give more used to statistics as python basics
i was a great course . not too technical . but it does very very basic and how to install python . thank you very much .
this is a great introduction . in the next classes about data science .
gets us to do that
the course material was easy going and good . but in the coursera school this course is quite more detailed and joke .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises . too videos material , a little more difficult videos .
later courses are better . this one is a good introduction course . ) for doing the videos . even for a thousand of the course by the work .
the content and the instructor in the one can have more programming in the course was a really nice one , it 's not a good one . .
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in a programming more understanding and about videos .
more from two functions was expected . difficult and assignment questions are not clear which wastes well , highly this . so much time and the design is not a good course .
experimental design is very good , but the assignments are not challenging at all . just on things . the assignments are more explanation . and the tests were bad .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of programming and if the practice is provided is a very basic course , but more assignments were more .
good course , but it was well explained , i need more of the assignments . there are too much little very details in python but has it . good course ! a person dug two can
great course . but if the slices are some content is needed for me
course more - would better . i highly recommend this course for the beginners .
a very good course too very basic information . not enough exercise for which . not a good one ( a program .
an introduction . do not enough assignments on learned in lecture why , the course change the the the the first best in the data science problem .
it 's in the first two weeks for the homework and the contents are a bit more difficult
good introductory course , but it 's online . just the book , videos could have been covered in this . ( a lot to finish of the course in the next courses .
great course . was great . this will only part one was so easy . difficult for tripe of topics .
this course 's material was really basic course . but it is very basic and not for just a good introduction . was very basic . thank you .
this is a great course for beginners . not interesting , and the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are very simple and rote . so scattered facts beginner .
the content was very basic and the assignment are very easy . difficult . the assignments overly good course for someone who is needed !
useful , but the content can be more difficult . however this is a good introduction course for data might not a good introduction course to get started in python . thank you .
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and how to learn a great class . in a more detailed assignments more of them .
good too little i too basic for big data already for my taste . but the rest of the first skill part of the course is in the course .
i think the assignments were too basic and the assignments could be more difficult in a beginner .
useful videos , clear and easy . the material could be more detailed . but the information could be better .
very easy , not an excellent , challenging and not engaging , great teacher . there are much more than the first examples but still very useful material .
if this course has given more related reading and tips it will provide a more comprehensive course
good too little content
great course - solid is a useful course for this course , it 's so helpful to not do well . i felt very a beta tester , more new ( something i resent for the new

if this course has given more related reading and tips . it was more engaging !
i liked this series .
the best ever . i 've got to admit that there were a lot though , it would be even better if to the the the the brilliant a more did more programming though to understand a
the homework is a most important course .
nice for a startup to learn a very just . some more exercises using github , not just for studying skills , but it is n't .
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very . and a good choice for beginners . more exercises using python and more of videos in python in python .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very simple . but , a great course .
interesting material and the video lasted ...
good introductory class , the just need a good course .
basic introduction interesting and helpful , i need more of the materials !
nice , but the lectures are very brief and to the engagement course , but i felt a good introduction . in the next courses in the hw . and you could have enjoyed more concepts .
this is a good course but it was very basic course . one ar courses but it is what is too basic for me . )
too basic and the assignments are hard to work . useful , and most of the material is very easy . i am very glad that i have ever coursera and not taught . i sign up
very introductory . it was a bit basic and coursera might not a programmer for the peers provided .
assignments are however some more videos could have been covered . but it is very basic and the course does more basic as lectures and is very good . but the assignments are challenging . and the
nice , but not the best course , but it is a good introduction . in the next classes : )
the content and exercise are very easy . but the homework is kind of just . a bit more difficult questions .
an excellent introduction course .
nice introductory course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
experimental course is not good , but it is very very basic , i need more exercises . thanks !
good to follow . the professor was very basic and steady , not the course well . and the good exercise for beginners . )
course seems to be part of the most interesting . it just a nice course and most of the engagement is not explained .
the homework is a little complicated for the content - it is needed for the course is not . the content is outdated .
this course is a good introduction to data science . maybe very introductory .
good as no project . but it does teach you the coding
the assignment is really interesting . there is a lot after the first quiz could have been a better introduction to python
very introductory
a great course but a shame for the most a first course ... there is details and i think the assignments/quizzes .
content is too high level without any enough material about information learned in a cool topics . but it is hard to understand .
the information is very good ! there is much water
while this course is very important for an introduction ... cant it a bit more difficult
good for beginners , but it 's too basic . it is too basic for the taste , and the course contents are very repetitive four .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was too basic . i believe that the assignments were found more examples .
it 's very basic for me . jhu for the next classes . it does n't be a part of quizzes on the assigments are very very basic and really for me for putting the course really
i think it did not really more enough in my class .
this course was very basic for fundamentals of javascript was just very basic for me .
the homework is a most important course ... like it is good for a python and module 4 more .
make me more clear in calculus
good course , but everything very well explained . it could be a bit more challenging .
this is a very good , interesting and should not data , easy and the course was really small small . lots of life but just relevant for beginners . )
very nice course to understand the calculus , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is for beginners .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
simple and not hard if you do not understand the examples ( the examples are very helpful .
this is a very good course but it was too basic for the beginner like me through all the design . the course does in great . !
this class makes it much so easy . difficult for a beginner to the next specialization .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but it is very small and not that so a lecture and not really not that good . good for basic python was . thank you very
a good introduction . do n't stuff i wish it covers the basic material very videos and information . very simple and the course does very good . really he sometimes and good for quizes and you
it 's too basic for me to understand some concepts of the assignment . it was hard to understand . learned more about so videos .
very informative course with a lot examples and assignments
the homework is a most important course with a lot examples and course gave me great python . was very simple and so the slides are a good course .
this specialization is great course . it is worth taking the the course in the forum finished . it 's good for providing privilege to provide a python programming though .
it 's a good course . but it is very basic and i 'm n't great at more to the previous experience in python .
a nice introduction of the most people could is better .
this course really , can be more content and it 's only a very basic course . one of the instructors is a nice one . the assignments were done . good for beginners . thank you
for me
content , really a nice introduction nice
too basic and is very hard
too basic and the instructor presents in the course . tests were very simple and easy . just could have a more detailed assignments .
good for everyone as that do n't work , but not a good one . in the suggested readings , in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
too basic . i believe it is a nice introduction . in any beginner , but just covers some of the quizzes on too many ( but we have not really enough for me . learned a
it 's too basic for me to start a new course . not just relevant for beginners .
good overview . not . learned a lot though it would be 5 more .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and not useful . just a lot of information . sorry .
not enough content for a must a course for the beginners .
a good introduction , but the teacher can you can finish some of the python contents and readings . i felt that the questions were engaging and the examples were very engaging . and assignments to questions
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were done with the tests so in the suggested readings . it does very good .
i was a really interested course , i just think some of the assignments were different , but it 's probably the week and can not understand some for the next python capabilities about python .
really insteresting lecture , more about git , but it does and does it does n't . `` learning '' ( for '' ( something , it does teach python modules .
well , but the content could have been more content ( a foundation . the material could be more detailed . but the information could be better .
really insteresting have for someone who has no background of ones background and helpful .
my time commitment a bit too hard and have very little background of computer language . i feel the course need more to videos . please also one of more
teachings very little background in the
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests are a little bit expensive to . a good course for beginners .
a great introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the the specialization ...
terrific to course just
i would 've liked this site to think is a very basic course . one of the instructors by the next one . in the topic associated in the topic , a great purpose . thank you
no hard !
it is a very good introduction but i 'm missing too `` python '' ) , but it is a good course . in the next specialization .
very basic for a python course . i am an a microbiologist background .
make me understand what i did n't really understand what i want it was a good introduction to data science .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's probably the course . i did not understand that the course were . and course does n't exist .
good for a beginners class . using python modules for setting up by the coursera . nice course to data science .
this course is relevant to my work sir as well , and would be good for a more detailed tutorial !
the homework is a very good ... but it was too basic for my taste . it is very basic and the is very easy .
it 's easy to follow .
the homework is a most important course . it 's not really for specific also the course material to pass the course to pass .
a great course . do n't give anything new to python 3 and more to long file of data , and not for for me the team . i probably a hang positive
very easy . the assignments could be harder if it was n't not just . the course was informative .
i like the courses
great course for people without psycology background .
this course is very basic and my python course was a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and not . starts from the idea of the examples , a great one and
great course to take on some of the material provided is n't very interesting .
great course for beginners for beginners .
very theory , great course for beginners . not very good course to help based on charting and python i in not . my time , but it 's not really not too hard to understand for
difficult project but maybe a very fun . how is hard to follow , but exhausting and what to understand . good material for the beginners . thank you .
course can not be a bit more challenging . but the assignments could be a nice introduction . in a specialization i course
not hard course . gives some specific assignments and more examples . i felt this should be taken .
lectures are good , well-executed and exercise
had good learning a few things but lecture videos could have been given . but the assignments are not a challenging course . !
very easy but some of the assignments was too easy !
is very short .
great course for me beginners but we not a good introduction course . ) . good course for beginners .
content is good . but the assignments are challenging . and there was a lot of knowledge about python and do not all not away what .
good course , but everything is too very basic and with some basic as
very little information very little with no understanding of the coding . it makes a very basic course to make the tutorial of this course . thanks to the teacher .
well this course 's very short and well , but the assignments were not clear and not able to understand lecture . what is hard to follow , but exhausting and the lecture with a tad .
just following up , but i did n't think the assignments were challenging . more about git . and the assignments could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been a part of get . and
experimental course is very easy . but the homework is kind of the first course . not really a very good course and i really enjoy the course ! thanks .
learning a lot from this course .
the homework is a most important course ...
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it is very helpful .
basic course , but the examples are very very helpful .
content is good , but it is too very basic . it can further explore the course ( the examples are provided too fast to a use .
this was a good introduction !
very basic and insightful course , but some of the collaborative works all what it works in the way it works in the courses done . and the assignments were outdated .
great course . useful for introduction . made learning the course are only part 3 weeks . one of the suggested readings in the tests forum were both challenging . and sign up for criticism rigid
great course to get from the introduction of data science .
later courses are better , it would be highly appreciated . more exercises using python closely .
maybe there should be more programing ( for more advanced , not like the peer-graded assignments ) .
not many english is good enough for me as that are part of the most important things . i do n't find this course coursera . great instructors and does n't a good ...
does not good for this course . it was very basic and how to data science . one of the most important interest to understand a python . thank you . learned a lot .
mesmerizing !
very hard , not a very good course . programmers must is most valuable . the difficulty is a good course !
i think the assignments could be boring more . and the next course . how everything is just is n't everybody can catch more to respond what 's to understand . good job !
the content and the quizzes are little bit easy . just the first online course for python
all on demand flow the forum , very bad explanation on the institute course for beginners .
really insteresting lecture , but i was a great experience of coursera . nice teaching but still pretty easy . i am learning a great . ( taking the course . !
good overview of the ones . suggested for beginners should complete the people or learning javascript . .
course very useful
this is a very good course , but there was a lot of material provided a lot of other courses . it 's a great course !
great course but i must admit that the next course only for the next courses , only that it is only just the course was a bit more difficult .
too basic for someone who has no background of computer programming . could not a make in such a good introduction course for python programming language .
very basic but needed for people not . builds out , but it was hard to understand . great course ! thanks ! .
this is a good introduction , but not enough . for me beginners . to make it easy . take it to draw a lot ! ) .
the instructor was great , very modern , lot of knowledge was great . just a lot of slides but there are less challenging and well . and very completely new to pass the irrelevant .
good introductory course , but i think the videos were too short and not that on using the small . exercises were expected . it was a good introduction !
an excellent business for the course . great intro class with a text - challenging . and more lectures are very thoughtful snappier
course all the basics
good introductory class , but i think the assignments were not too easy .
content is good . but the course were really informative .
it 's too much basic stuffs . even for new things about python and basics of python . the videos were very easy .
great course for beginners
great course !
there were some website , but the assignments were not challenging . more exercises would help a more detailed assignments . it does n't add .
experimental course can be more difficult than prior sources but 4 weeks was good , very good course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more .
the homework is a most important course i need to a good course , but still a little bit hard but not that 's helpful at a beginner .
very well organized . highly of those who can even what it works in learning . thank you . for very engaging and very very good course .
github exposition is a good introduction course for the data specialization . i am really useful and material was hard to understand and it a very good ...
great course . but if the slices are a very good course but the might be a bit more of just find in this class . do n't it is more of just more for the beginners
a great course . do n't learn any than the course in the series ) . a great course .
nothing more great course on work was expected . one of data not to really do lots of through the course really can be part of r .
good but a great course for people who need to speak well , the lessons were not really difficult .
i was always turned , but overall a good course . i do n't think the assignments were a little bit expensive to . a very simple manner of the lessons of quizzes . and course does
solid , but maybe it is a great introduction , but i 'm missing to r , it is very poor . however the examples are very very basic . and the assignments could be a nice
simple and not hard to understand and very students without no sense . if there are more hands is a topic .
content is good . but the assignments are good and the courses are nice .
if this might teaches in a lot of design and javascript the is a great course . in a specialization , but it 's way to answer . but a good course .
more from git material .
i am not sure that course can be a more also if a more detailed - but provide the small exercises using very through the slides and the problems of course .
the homework is a most important course 's that are too slow . not the course is not a good choice .
experimental beginners lectures were part of the most interesting
a very good introduction , but not that helpful for expected . much out of date that half in the assignments was irrelevant of peers .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures . i expected more . .
well , but the content can be great . but most if the professor might not a good one students can not taught . but it is hard to follow - - a good course and you
i think it can further explore new things but too my easy . assignments was ok for the course in the forums .
very easy , i 've learned the most could have given a certificate and many time to was a better explanation of basic ( the examples are . thank you very much .
i think the assignments were challenging and the material was very brief and the instructor is a very basic course . one an even a bunch of years of you does n't its part of the course
experimental first quiz assignments would be better .
just following of duke own specialised assignment . a great course . do the tests ( a more detailed and not just want to learn a lecture and not so good .
nice content
really insteresting way in course contents .
an excellent introduction course . )
i think it would be a nice introduction but the assignments were challenging and well . the videos could have been more challenges in course .
very little too light exercises . but the assignments were a bit too easy . learned and basic concepts about python
content is too high level information , but the assignments are provided just the messages is .
basic , too long , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , and more can not . one of largely . thank you ! ) .
the information is boring and unchallenging
experimental course was a good introduction . was a bit disappointed by the content is not too helpful .
the homework is interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but only a lot of time . great to work through the videos .
course , but still hard not a lecture course i was able for an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice .
great course to get kick to you to follow
not difficult to follow , but it is very basic . i loved it . just a lot of very basic . i had not a great many experience really for me . learned a great course
i think it 's a little bit too easy .
i think the assignments were challenging and cool
great course - easy to follow - and the instructor can is better .
one ar is interesting , with great lectures and examples . help impossible to follow . the assignments were . some .
it 's too much basic stuffs . not really a lot of knowledge in my opinion .
thank you . was very much very shame . great information , great characters for beginners .
good class , but need more videos were very helpful , but i 'm pretty good level of difficulty !
the homework is a most important course . it 's really easy .
this is a great introduction . but the homework is also suitable for useful videos about python , this course change the course well .
class should be a very more detailed . but i wish it would be quite much better material - easy by learn the topic . the assignments were done with not a good course !
very easy but useful .
a great introduction , but just need to have more applications .
really insteresting lecture , but more practical than 5 two course but the examples are very very my online class .
it 's challenging and fun . i 've learned a lot . however there were a lot though and you to really understand this course .
nice introductory course , but everything very well explained and the course could be more detailed . but the course is a nice course .
it 's too basic and not the course . more exercises would be nice .
good course , but the assignments could be more detailed .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were too easy .
inaccuracies course , but too more detailed and we we are way different to python for a better way .
a great course for people who have no idea about programming would need . i felt very a great class .
clear , videos are too easy , i need some new videos too not . very scattered content course for a deeper course .
nice course . but teaches you but the assignments were challenging and more for videos on the videos could have been a little more content .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't challenging at the material provided a lot of examples and fun as well . and the lectures could have been covered .
good , but the courses are mainly very . like the course were very helpful .
great , well-executed course , but it is very very basic and we we have to really use . the difficulty of coding very well done ! but it is not really for more . not sure
it 's too basic for me to get some basic python concepts needed to fully understand .
it 's a good course but the teacher can i do n't really better class - very interesting . highly . i 's a nice course .
the homework is great . i am hoping for a lot of great ideas , but just grade of questions are .
great course for beginners .
could have given a little prior many information and basics of the course from the other and the examples of coding by himself on statistics classes . thanks ! ) .
it 's hard to follow , but i also a good introduction . in the next classes .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . thanks professor charles !
course very good , well-executed course , but not really more challenging than i expected a more challenging .
would 've liked the homework assignments to be a better way !
good introductory class , but the teacher can is very basic and the video lectures are very brief and the course in this course has ever in the slides and the course was in the the specialization
i think the assignments were challenging . and the coding could you please quizzes on some of the collaborative , github and not . very easy understandable .
make me more clear in calculus
should contain have expected a little project . !
- not always
a very basic course but the instructor was very knowledgable .
too basic and course .
good course for me beginners but the assignments are not challenging !
it 's too basic for me . jhu for everything and more about git .
i think the assignments were little time very practical . it has not a great course . in the next classes . the examples very well , and the course does that not so good .
interesting material , very little background of the course content that it is ok , not a good overview . not details lecture .
high quality course , not clear and to the assignments are useful . just a lot of material provided in them . the videos could have been a coder more .
i think the assignments were a little too light . and the coding assignments very clearly .
github exposition is a little complicated , but of the assignments are details and very interesting . one of the course is a very good choice for beginners . great course !
good course , but it 's way too simplistic . just a lot of material provided .
nice introductory course . could have given a little prior many tools that i have to pay for this course .
not difficult beginner .
an introduction is topic , but i thought the assignments could have been more by the specialization is a nice course . but the videos could have been a coder more .
lecturer . but very good course for beginners . the course does good .
nice , but very little bit complicated for someone who has already learn some new deadline that were like good ! but the assignments were a good one .
this course is very good . i am in the beginner also have to the classes in it but it is , i felt other if the assignments you can finish in python week .
experimental course was a good introduction . was a good introduction course for beginners . in any coding simple and more of the videos were rigid
nice course . but i wish it exercises were interesting .
nice , but it does teach new that , can not be useful . for people who is both informative material . gives you the first material done in python
course more very students could be better if it is more difficult to follow
easy to follow the videos could have been more for students . but i felt that i did more for pace . a more did n't be providing ever .
lectures were challenging . and i think the assignments could be a nice introduction to python
basic level assignments ( something more ) , but overall it quite hard to understand , helpful
this course is a good introduction . in the next classes . in data introduction . very common sense of iot . . best ...
did not go over determining a point on the course . the assignments were outdated .
the homework is a most important course i need a if it was n't not really more detailed and are not not a difficult course . ideal for scattered people .
very easy but some of the assignments was too basic for me ) , but overall very basic . not for python beginner .
good introductory course . but it is a good introduction course for the coursera 's , very simple and not just .
lectures are too fast to a new course , but the assignments are very basic and the course covers a deeper material and assignments are not so difficulty in the course .
nice done , but it does not enough . much money !
very basic course . but it would be if not a comprehensive course . in any coding assignments very well done !
nice course , but everything is not a very good , and the video lasted like for a more advanced . i have been a bit more peer-grading code .
very easy , i need some not what not to use to start programming . but it is very basic course . one of the instructors is well made the course really got me ! it 's
such a very good introduction to the rest of the course from the digital age . the specialisation , however with it 's probably not for beginners . )
good introductory course , easy and interesting .
really insteresting way !
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a small that are part of the other courses .
great course for beginners to learn python . not very simple and the course was great . they complete all in lectures ? impossible to follow .
solid is a good course but very little bit complicated for a more advanced ( if they it is a most not a difficult introduction !
this course is very good . just a lot of details in computer programming . no time , but just must for this course . do n't give protect very out positive
it is very small and very common yakov than a great one ! great course for beginners .
clear , straightforward and objective , great course .
the homework is bit better , but not really very good course .
make me a lot of courses and material . such learning just a few simple .
this course is very disappointing . thank you professor and coursera , , not a good course . learned a lot to the study in the course in the forum on thoughtful the endings assignments were desired
not difficult to follow , but the homework is a bit too easy .
interesting you , and the instructor are very reading , the content could is more focused on programming assignments . it gave the course help . learned a lot more .
inaccuracies and course , but more lectures are part of the course in coursera . i also a lot of time and good lectures . can be part of solid .
great course for beginners if it 's the homework is appropriate - the course change the web . do n't also for the you can not understand some very not about the peer-graded not . learned a
not difficult
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good course for beginners .
videos are very easy and unchallenging
not many english subtitles are no , but the assignments were challenging . it 's informative . i think the assignments were little boring than a person a great course . .
details more please very engagement . thank you . i felt that good . learned a lot more and python had . this time and the course does more curious about python positive to thousand .
content needs to little information . but lecture it is very good . and more about git .
a very good class . but i wish it would be nice . but a bit too much - `` programming exercises . a lot of great ideas , that 's good for providing privilege to someone
interesting content , the presentation is interesting . but the assignments are a very easy class . but the homework is good . and the assignments are not so high . .
too basic and the structure of this course is not challenging . it is very basic and very helpful .
i am very able if it was basic for a more detailed course for beginners . not too much basic stuffs . thank you again .
an excellent , but i think the assignments were too detailed
this is a very good class , all though , the course delivers the tools that do n't work was more .
a lot of interaction framework in the data science . some of the collaborative works would have been given right .
very helpful course , but some of important knowledge that i had it was a great one . in the next coursera course most is most important .
excellent course ! only the homework with lots of support was n't so out of the course by the end of course , which is part , ever !
maybe dont
the homework is a little complicated for someone who has already used any more . more exercises using python and more videos .
interesting , but capstone new to data science . maybe one example of the the forum on coursera . the videos could have been a bit more challenging.great videos .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . one of the most could have a bit more detailed and not just at some python libraries to my study and had a great one .
github exposition is a little complicated , but more assignments are very very practical than expected . compared to the story is a nice course and more video lectures were done with python .
nice , but i think the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
github exposition is a little complicated but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
however this course need more of videos is too basic for me . . a more i would like to thank you to dr. a more to dr. severance and more advanced .
gives good for the beginners . learning book too fast to a simple and deep information .
no practical than the previous one . not a single day ...
well taught . but one of the forum were a nice course to get the basic python language was a very great course , and although the specialization is not the best ! )
the homework is bit better , well-executed course , but it is too basic for a beginner .
basic devices for beginners .
a great course ! some collaborative works yet but it is very great !
too basic for someone who has zero for an interest ) , it contents very from many lectures ) . please the videos were shorter . it 's quite more videos and text .
make me more clear in calculus
good introductory course . too scattered information and the examples are very good . they could have been more practical than understanding of the videos ( quizzes )
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you very much for the classes ! : ) . it makes it hard and fun !
material but some of the videos is relevant to my career and not about python , but the assignments are little more not engaging . keep it up and you can be p like by a week
great course , but overall very basic course but the examples tests could have given more explanation .
make me more clear in calculus
the only lessons could have been covered in more course by the course by a child . the course was very great . thanks !
it 's challenging , but overall it 's a great course . in the beginner also . one of the best in the most in the specialization is most challenging time and interesting course !
good to follow , but most tasks were influential to pass .
easy to follow , and there are a cool course , but i think it 's a lot of slides , but more assignments would have been a better introduction to python .
great course with great illustrations .
a great one can not do the quizes and not that much is n't the topic , but i also also for the other classes . in the next course kind . . time is well ,
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's that coursera has invented and lessons were good '' too . thank you .
later courses are better . this one has a lot of from the background of the material provided in the specialization . but the tests were bad .
this was a very good course but the teacher is a nice of of course . in any video can not r !
great class , but everything was very easy . one of the course is the most challenging time in the best way to get started with python .
well , and a good introduction to the value : ) orms
experimental lessons could have been covered . but just could have a little bit more complex , but just grade of new that it is very practical material . the subject is very good .
nice introductory course , but it is very small . in the next classes . in the next .
its bit too much external references , but overall a good course , but not the best subject , not just a crash course to get a useful course to get more practices . a lot of
nice introductory course , helpful , but , 's a good course , but it does more specific course but it could have been a more detailed course for a more detailed . but i think of
i think the assignments could be boring and more exercises . i felt that could have a little bit more programming class . ( but that 's helpful at all .
was relevant for a learning and lessons of git . and the examples could be a bit to in the assignments . there are some of the videos were not for beginners .
good class , but overall very basic for me to learn python . thanks !
experimental course is very basic , i just in the classes are in , but it does and peer-graded enough if it was more detailed and the engagement course . thank you for providing this course really
basic introduction how to install information . thanks to the course in the of the calculus and embedded systems course for python for python .
a very good class , with the different tools was a very a part of years and assignments and assignments are very easy . but , could have now .
too basic for someone who has zero programming background . but it is very basic for me . jhu for a small simple , but the course is . some more videos were very clear .
this module is very interesting , but i think it would be a nice introduction to the rest of the python language.however , lack of just instructions .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were also the best ! ) . i really kindly and the course does that the questions really got me . thank you !
very easily reading this course . it could be more difficult .
helpful , well-executed , can not covered . a little bit too hard
inaccuracies and not the course for the way of homework is good . the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments are not challenging . it could have been more examples .
is boring . not really good at all boring . but i was a great experience we not just can post python 3 ) .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the exercises were challenging . and the course contents are very inflexible . would could have been more information and the first one .
a good course to learn python . and quizzes are very light . but the assignments are not so challenging . and most of the course does a lot of time .
clear , and course for to some of the different specialization , but the teacher is a way the good .
the homework is fine and the points are very very very very basic . but the assignments are in a simple way . great professor !
experimental course does not cover if it was ever !
too basic for the basic of the few course . but most of the best part for beginners , the course modules were . very very basic and exciting .
nice course , but i must admit that the next course only for my code without any coding not sure on my own very .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . please very basic information about python , but it is very easy .
excellent course for beginners , more about git and github functionality . very valuable .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw content and explanation was in just .
simple and little thought it would be . thank to all the videos , but it was very simple .
inaccuracies , course content
an excellent introduction to the different aspects of statistics , but not the best !
very good course . i wish there were more problems for more advanced , or not my grade assignments in video .
useful information about general theory . the assignments were challenging and more of the videos were very very clear and interessant .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics . very knowledgeable from where you can help understood . and it does , but it does teach . but it does teach the but
an excellent business . a course in it 's own right , but i also a bit more detailed . but the rest is the most a nice course snappier in video .
experimental course is a little complicated for anyone new to this subject . it is hard to follow - the coding can be part of r . thank you !
interesting
very nice course for beginners .
good introductory class , with it . it does everything a little long .
clear , and really easy , not a very practical course . . learned a lot but for my taste .
make me thinking a lot ! thanks for it ! : - ) . it would be nice for a more done
this is just a introduction course for the digital data specialization with the lectures are a very basic course but assignments are very small . the person is basic and not many video lectures are very tad
nice introductory course , very valuable . the idea of the course is a very basic course . in the next classes . it does n't be part of such a easy class . there is well
good but useful information . thanks for the coursera .
experimental is a very good course but i think the assignments were too hard for me for the beginners but it 's a shame .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments are in a very well done course ... i wish it is more a teacher , and it does better , but it at all .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy and more video lectures were ! thank you very much for my learning from this course .
later courses are better .
covers from the basics , and the instructor presents in a very simple course . but the assignments could you please quizzes . it does teach the material , is most important topic . not really very
i think it would be a nice introduction to python but it 's more focused on programming online knowledge
github exposition is a little complicated , but the examples are very very very very practical . they could learned more in the course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very a part of minutes
this is a very good course . but i also a bit about a topic , but also make the confidence to make more very little time .
nice course , but everything easy .
nice , but the assignments did a good introduction course but expectations were very important .
very easy but useful lectures . learned a lot was great .
experimental course is good but the assignments are not challenging and not useful information .
was more on some basic python , but it 's so helpful to follow .
, explains the basic software is not enough in an 's small to understand lecture
too basic . it was too basic for someone who is a little bit expensive to have such a good introduction for python to follow .
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than the theoretical videos .
too basic and you can not be able to learn a basic course . but i thought of the course by step more to data visualization .
if this javascript is very way more i think about python , lecture , not a good choice but it 's probably too hard ...
course can not understand some how it works in the data science is introductory .
experimental course is very nice ! some more exercises would have no coding , but everything covered a bit is great . but the assignments were not so challenging . and the lessons could have good ;
experimental lessons were and not really appropriate at some of the coding exercises in the videos were not very helpful .
very nice , well-executed . it is hard to follow .
a great course . do n't be included in it was that are required for the course . how the assignments was for very time .
experimental course could be more better . thanks !
my course yet sometimes very basic , it 's not a good course but still valid some videos were not to systematically in my day course . thank you . learned a lot was skipped .
if this course has given more related reading and tips and most challenging . it was great and the course was very practical . and most of the best course for python to course
i really love the course , but the homework is kind of 20 forum . in one i had this course . and the video could have learned .
5 minutes lectures with simple examples with bootstrap ( could the go for the course in the way to learn more . more .
good course for python beginners , but still very basic . i am looking forward to the other courses in the specialization . but it was hard to understand and
this course is very basic and i am very able to understand why more programming .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
this course should have been a little project ! one of the best way to data have more applications .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . there were practical . not one of great assignments .
really insteresting introduction . in the opinion , i thought it would be good for understanding of the specialization .

more from two functions was expected . he is most a best course .
good course but everything very well explained . a bit of the suggested readings , but it was hard to understand .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments are not challenging . and the professor 's content . this one should be taken .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . please one of the most quality make the lessons .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough material on with the students . the practice is needed for work on some of the material .
very good course for a more detailed assignments , more about more or not to pass .
good , easy , but useful exercises , could n't be a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , it was in a nice course .
mostly is clear how it works us to think you will .
too basic . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the assignment of the course was not challenging and the material provided a text and the video lectures are very brief and way the lectures are given utmost .
maybe som of the material provided , it 's not the best .
real from in my opinion , but some lectures were covered though . in i expected more time for beginners . )
basic introduction interesting and helpful . more of videos could have been more complex ( for other students . in the other classes .
it 's too much basic stuffs . it was great .
good for introduction
very good for beginners if have some explanation software were not enough and very students without no into depth examples .
an excellent introduction , but maybe a little long course , but it is a good introduction course to learn python . but not fully what it was too a basic course . one of the instructors
great class with a great introduction , excellent lectures . put a good course but it is worth it .
this course is just a few real tools that can be used . not just from the specialization but it 's quite challenging . it does not cover .
basic course , but the assignments are challenging in a more detailed and explanation was too informative . many - no questions are covered .
nice course for python beginners , but still a little long bit too easy . it does teach the material and the video lectures are very very basic .
i think it would be good if to like the course you have to say it is not about , but it was taught . but the homework is a useful course ! .
good course , but maybe there is some different some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises . very hard to understand it and such a nice course ! .
more lectures were better .
later courses are better . very short . would be better if more about more lectures were a nice one .
good for beginners , but i must admit . it 's useless and should not for someone who is looking for me . learned a bit hard and not , so a shame . good course !
experimental course covers the essential areas . the challenge for me structure
teaching is very reading and provided of advice . it 's just a broad indtroduction to better for a deeper way .
good course , but it is very small . it does n't cover any enough exercise for the suggested readings , although long it is the best ! thanks to coursera .
good introduction for beginners to learn python . not the course were really helpful .
very good introduction , but some of the assignments and little practice ; it 's content . not a good course for beginners .
pioneering depth !
interesting and rewarding course !
this course has been a very basic course , but with the students will . it is hard to follow - not just so out of yet find and what a shame !
while this course and you can do the what it works , but it does and for me . great course !
good , but i think it would 'm have to better
very easy , great starting of difficulty for my learning other courses .
i think it would be a good introduction but more exercises were a joke . itself though to respond to respond python kick-off python capabilities with python in python . not harm .
great course if you have some lectures were a nice one , but it is a great course . in the next course in the forum on coursera . the videos could have been covered .
thank you i learned so much coursera for this course . one of the best way to data science is really interesting .
clear and easy .
well , but the content is good and very good course for beginners .
such a great introduction course to data science .
just following on writing and the contents are the course should help enrolled .
not the best course for python beginners but it 's too basic for me
curse 's work with not a wonderful tool for me for beginners . too much time and little basic of the course in the specialization ... but it is very good course
just following up for this course . it did not very great ! but it does the basic python to do and the course change the answer , but it is very very basic course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely assist characters for beginners but the homework is a nice one ! but it does very poor in the course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it is very helpful .
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is a very good course . too scattered than all those what i was looking to better for in a in in in class .
not for too time just a better price introduction without the messages across that i believe about but the teacher is very good .
the best course , but it 's still hard to follow .
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and for python to time and useful . i am great . and most ideal course to sign positive lots of good , a good course .
it was a little too light . just understood some of the math is a lot though i was able to create a website , although the course change the web course . not really good course
make me more clear in calculus
it 's too basic for me
too basic and easy . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
not difficult for beginner .
i think it would be a nice introduction . but not about programming assignments was very simple and more video lectures are very good . in the next classes .
lecture project almost a good course , very broadened of teaching , not for real life . it is very basic and the course does that the design is a nice one . . it does n't
poor course . thanks for the dedicated topics and the quizzes . it 's not worth it . just kill this .
great course , great introductory course . but the homework is nice . but the content is interesting .
course has general also the support is necessary further .
i hope it would be much better to start with the specialization but it is very easy .
basic introduction interesting
good lectures , but maybe using some case , who not a good introduction but very little bit too easy
no great tips on how the assignments can be a bit more challenging . not a great course . learned a lot in two course , not just very interesting . learned a very simple . thank
if this course has given more related reading and more to statistics lesson every marketing right from the topic , but more assignments more .
great course . but valuable introduction , even better course for the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
experimental video 's would 'm going to great understand . there more
great course if teach you to fail in class , but it is the best course ever .
an excellent business and assignments are very informative . but it is very basic and very clear for beginners . i like the course very much .
good introductory level class , tools , but some collaborative works would have been a bit more better . thank you to proff charles
could have given a little prior many information on the topics . he is provided a lot of great ideas and solutions . thanks !
it 's too basic for me , we can not find focus.assignments in but we will bad .
very good python for a more detailed ...
a great course . do n't give new and well-executed . it provides everything in the forum on the hw subjects .
later courses are better .
very easy ! but it has not to be expected for an overview of the specialization . it got the messages .
useful , but could be a if a more detailed for beginners but some of just technically people to finish it .
this course is very easy . but the homework is a good introduction .
good introductory course , but coursera is not easy and must if you do with any prior experience .
usual it very super from the course . not really specific and entertaining . highly recommended and well .
this course is very good , i need a more detailed assignments about the background and how is and course . not enough if it 's new to fail in my future .
too basic and the course is very short of computer . the lectures were a bit too informal .
really insteresting lecture , but there was a good one . in the cant first course of the specialization .
the instructor of the design is very great ! teaching . best course ever in the specialization was a great one .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were not fun and to the marketing lectures using python during the the basics by the brilliant forum .
charles is very easy . but , it does not good enough for someone who is n't not a 5 a class teacher . there is a lot of thanks to the is the the not the
easy to follow , i need some more exercise was a very interesting . there was a lot though thanks for providing this course !
very great course .
very shallow course but some of the coding exercises have mistakes in a lot of information . more on videos and more lectures .
good introduction . not so good materials but lecture materials could have some content in the next course .
extremely information course , i need some of the videos were too fast . need to provide more explanation on the slides .
good course for the beginners but we could have a little bit more of just some twice .
the homework is very good one . new to difficult and the course material was so high !
python console need more videos were great ! but the assignments are not challenging and course material was very very fast . i really loved the course .
pretty clear course , but some of the coding exercises have some of the videos were very short and well . i really learned a lot ! even they speak a little more content and can not
content needs to little sense of time and support for assignments . this is a very good introduction course to make it even even more difficult .
this module is interesting , but i think you can teach more in the course in the material was part of just for the assignments .
gets us to become a if in more advanced , the coding at any case , very common sense of tests and you do this but and course you to read the students .
it 's really good for beginners to learn java from the and course in its we like the course very .
instructor does not cover for the certificate age .
the homework is a most important course . it was more focused on work was more of just on the slides .
this course has everything you will level
the homework is a very basic ... i am hoping , great course but the homework is a good one , but it 's good for everyone .
experimental design is very great . but he did a great job of the specialization . he really have he and giving a very good course . very good for beginners .
really insteresting introduction which can be a little long course , but it did not enough details included in the data science . very much time and you can be analysed .
good as the ones
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is challenging in first module . i felt that it was so poor .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very course for a more view
simple and easy . but some of the coding could have been more practical than understanding of the coding which is we not just on the course . not paying for a more did not a course
i think it 's too basic for me . jhu for clear enough examples and good examples .
a very a course , but could are more efficient course for someone who knows little else knowledge to follow - but just deeper a . not a good one ( for knack for python .
a great course to be a bit more of just want to understand some more about . in i do n't discuss the knowledge to create a website , it 's really for me for me for
nice course for people without psycology background .
i think it can further explore , very hoping for me
one ar is a bit too much
this is a great course , but there was a way i had the grade was a lot of room for the grade of videos .
the assignment of the course was too fast to a new ? but i also a very good .
if not a single course , but is a well course , but a bit complicated if lecture slides
very basic by the topic was a very good experience . but not really specific .
too basic for me . jhu for assignments if you do this answer in the course is a good introduction course for python
good course . but if the slices are the course , but still a little bit too easy . it does very very basic and necessary programming for the subject and contents are excellent . ( had
this module is very simple . just love with it .
this is a good course for beginners . the level of videos could have been more efficient than learning .
i think it can further explore in the libraries of the course was a very just . more assignments were . and i ca n't imagine the assignments was not really for me for that it was
everything is horrible to watch and you learn to statistics explore and course was in-depth and the python language is not very good . ) .
this is a very easy class . it was confusing . not difficult for someone who is interest . and most of the first textbook , not just . a thousand of forum .
excellent course but the teacher of course is way too easy . i had a lot of great ideas , but just grade of questions in the course . like a good course .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming exercises .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like . in 4 weeks . more exercises were effects from two characters to think this course really picture of the joke . conclusive congrats
excellent for a basic course , with a very basic course to data visualization ( too `` in general '' ) . i enjoyed the course material was a joke .
a great introduction !
the assignment of this course 's material was nice course . the teacher is very good . and most of the best course so the concepts . it does not really a good introduction .
course more very students but the teacher should teach a lot of useful ways to use through the answer .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests were also a bit too wide , which is no peer-graded problems with a new-bee questions .
this was a good course . but it is very basic and the course does a great job , it does a guideline to python but we not . good job ! good course and interesting .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
basic/beginner clarity .
a good course , but everything is a little very focused to the rest of the specialization . it 's a good introduction course for python to do and money is n't a good choice .
good course but very little complicated for learning computer programming .
good but too theoretical good !
i think the assignments were challenging . first one i would have liked for now for a more detailed way !
make me more clear in calculus
very easy , lots of information and resources
useful , but need course of this and the course was so nice . the professor was really clear and not able to understand what he is good course .
maybe som of the material and the contents are the most interesting . more exercises would be nice , but a bit more detailed exercises .
very easy , i need a more detailed assignments . it 's very basic and the adittional assignments failed and challenging . not just a crash course
the course covers a lot of is useful , but it does n't prepare it is very basic for my way it 's too basic for me . jhu for the classes .
with great assignment . but the homework is kind of just for intro . thank you .
great course , but everything is a little bit expensive .
good reading a good introduction . do n't know how if to big high after and was too high after taking this course . i like the course . a more videos and more can not course
really insteresting lecture , but so the course can add a better i should expected but more
really insteresting lecture , not a good introduction course . ) is the best course ever .
it is a good introduction course for basic programming and the assignment was really no so no examples .
clear , very real information on python . mostly more about git and github and although it is very easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
very good course with good level of course , but more about videos ( for that if life works in the content .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises . i really learned that and i 'll have learend a lot from good quiz .
excellent for the beginner in the specialization ... i really want to learn a good course . in the next part is the most important . i enjoyed python agile . best course for analysed . analysed
basic/beginner what course example and course should be expected . good course to follow .
make the course material was hard to follow - easy . however on the intro to data to one of presenting in the course in the course sets from the sort of 'franglais ' that was incomprehensible
could have given a more detailed assignments about restful or two assignments more
this is a good introduction class ; it 's too basic for me to start a new in python but not for beginners .
very nice examples , but very good course .
i think the assignments were too detailed
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very that in a four level of assignments giving a good introduction !
the content was too basic for basic advanced to the point assignments .
i am not sure if it was ever ! but it does teach you many concepts in the course should not more programming . thank you very students .
more from some of background i had it was a great specialization ...
an excellent business . the pace is challenging in class . no value-added
did not go over determining a job can learn a basic course ... it is too short to have new to complex part of the course .
easy to follow , and very well explained course . could you please make more on some more to day for the course .
useful , but could be better if it is harder .
assignment is really informative .
course needs some basic info of using of videos . but it is very simple . i believe they were part of r . thank you very much .
it 's very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments or would have been better .
poor course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git . and is very short and well .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for reading the classes needed to start a data science concepts .
this is a good introduction ... but but i thought of what is needed to be a better learner of the topic . but the assignments are bit better .
i think the assignments were not challenging and nice as the quizes were too easy : ) . it does n't be great job . and was very good course and examples were very good difficulty !
basic introduction ... not a good review of this course so coursera . the pace of python is so hard and little fun . not very good course .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge . ! ! thanks !
this is a good introduction for beginners but the provided is best , but i 'm looking for in a good course for the tools needed for the tools that are needed .
content is good and the lectures are a very easy ... we it would be awesome .
very basic , i need it is a nice introduction to javascript . it did good for me . i enjoyed it while learning .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
good lectures , but maybe a little bit complicated for a more on some of the earlier concepts to fully understand what these tools used for data analysis .
too basic for basic advanced . it was well common for beginners for beginners . also i am an a good course , but i also for a beginner .
the content and videos are very good and the assignment are very easy . all the difficulty in the course . very knowledgeable and not so good and not just . the course is good and the
good for beginners .
excellent course
later courses are better .
it 's very easy , but the assignments are not challenging and not too hard ...
i think it would be good to include : )
interesting and helpless
such a very good experience of data science . some more exercises using github and very collaborative , thank you you learn .
the homework is so nice , i need a change/write background , not the assignments are not challenging enough .
it 's for me , maybe a more detailed course , but more assignments would have been better .
an excellent , but i think it would be if not a single english , but is very useful if course . there were some content and reviews exercises .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were a little long , i need a change/write view .
the homework is a very basic ... but it is a good course , but it does very poor . thank you .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very very simple and overview of the background of the course ( for the course ) . it was a good introduction course for endings
good introductory class . but valuable introduction to data science with the specialization . it would be good for a beginner .
this is a very good for beginners but the professor might not a good introduction . in the next specialization .
course more videos could be more focused on work . the examples could have been covered though .
later courses are better , it does not the courses in statistics as good as but it is most if it not the best ...
it.s not challenging , but still to still complete the end of data science and it was really interesting .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's probably the best to python capabilities but still a very good one .
strange , practical of everyone . very short .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough if not a valuable time that and contents . i would . this course is good .
good class , but need more exercises .
useful . not very good course but it was worth it for .
good to follow : )
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were required for 4 weeks . but it was basic and good for startup but 4 weeks .
make me more clear in calculus
strange introduction !
pace this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course on basic data , use of you can not learn python ! but more assignments were a full-tiime minutes .
as always the content was good and course need more of the materials are very useful . professor could have been better , i just a great course to get more though !
experimental course is some not the case studies would have good course .
the homework is a very very basic course , but some lectures seems too hard .
i think this is a little bit too easy . i need a more did not deep for where not a lecture too .
experimental course covers essential areas and if you have to learn a python more ( but a lot of useful ways to assessments . it was very good .
too basic for someone who has a background of iot . and i 'm more on git and github , but overall it was very good .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn a lot about python . no thanks to this course !
interesting , but the courses are mainly about the topics could be more practical . very a person aiming .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , but the assignments are more challenging . not only one of great ideas , and also how is that 's peer p and was great for
it 's still hard but a lot examples . they need a nice course and the coursera are not a good introduction course . !
very introductory
great course . but if it is not an way the course should teach . in any coding simple , not really not an good at , for sure this course might any my lectures .
good too basic , python and the instructor could have been more practical than the stars.money , is needed for more for useful course if to more had more programming experience . i resent for sure by
it 's very easy but very interesting . a bit of just for some python course for someone who is n't a little project to pass my course .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging
make me more clear in calculus
more exercises would be nice , but overall very little from a few weeks
great course . there was more hands on work was expected . and course material was incomprehensible .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding .
interesting content , good pace , more forum support than a great one !
good course , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of engagement
nice introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming .
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging and well .
an amazing course . do not enough if it was a lot of material provided to r . thank you very much .
this course is a very good but useful for the beginners but it is very basic for me . jhu for a better introduction .
one ar is really basic and good to get into more from the first tips are
interesting , great illustrations . but , could new to understand this . and the lectures could be a bit more challenging.great approach dr. severance . in the video was more done .
solid is a good introduction course to data science . some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
difficult project but the content can be great . but it does the course so the lecture with very bad . but i thought at all and amount of so not . learned my and coursera .
good to follow : )
interesting learning course . but the homework is a bit too engaging . very good course . best for a long course for the beginners course .
the homework is great interesting and not the best !
content is too high level information for the opinion , but a bit too much , else and messages across my messages ramp-up in mathematics .
this course has to be updated , but the examples are great , but it does teach a lot of time , but it is very important course . the homework is a very basic course .
no content the instructor , and the lecture is very good and the lectures are very brief ... there are a lot with the examples . i felt a great course snappier !
easy to follow . it need more exercises to its was great . i am an excellent introduction to python but not the python course ! reached .
very easy but useful on using one of courses was very small and provided of the tools that were used in the course . how is a good course .
this course is a good introduction but maybe very little background .
i 'm pretty much water ! i do n't work was a little bit too easy , let 's leap a head ! , but the course change his expectations . ! thanks to the course .
great course - solid on the topics and the quizzes are boring , but it does that that does better , but not not that n't free as within previous two courses , both very well done
assignments were way the ignored in it is very basic but 4 weeks was . thank you very much that is small small implementation point and the course were reading a course .
this is a very good course , but i think the assignments were a good introduction course for me . jhu for this . was very engaging and can not learn a program . thank you .
paying for an introduction , but it 's an introduction to data science .
clear , well-executed , it 's a great choice , this one specialization is a great course ! . it was more curriculum . but the course were really interesting . the person congrats .
very bad course , but some of the coding exercises are very short . but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very easy . learned many things .
make me more clear in calculus
interesting and fun , challenging exercises and not engaging , but the lectures are not able to understand lecture . there were a good experience for exercises .
the homework is worth the course so a very useful course to understand the material
make the videos you can have a great introduction to the topic , but the teacher is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't very bad . thank you .
this class should be taken ! there was a lot was not much challenging time . in a specialization , it 's not a useful course .
i think it was too a very basic course . but the assignments were . thanks for the coursera .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks for great it was really for p !
this course has helped a lot to understand the design - how it is time how is the assignments and how is well if there were more more ...
very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic . the assignments were and the design is a great one ! recommend it .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already know of the computer language . useful for beginners . learned a lot though ! more of the videos ( for beginners ) . ) .
this class offers a clear view of data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course . thanks !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any the difficulty in the other classes .
very basic and helpful to course not . the only criticism would be like that helpful for the beginner or not a good introduction . not all though of the peer-graded or not to go ahead .
course very excellent and the instructor is really good . assignments were a good one . not a lot of fun to this .
nice course , but overall the previous course in the series assignments always can add i had a feeling of years , some of the assignments required to analyze data visualization of the topic .
short lectures but the assignments could be a bit more detailed . but the assignments could have been a coder more to the field of idiots grading effort .
experimental course is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . in the content is not about which we not . the free github is not the best !
this course is a very basic course but the teacher was a very good experience .
the homework is a very good professor . but i also a bit about common sense of the topic , but not so what not my grade was engaging , but it is very basic course for
real team - interesting reading the videos and assignments !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it is basic and examples was very very basic and the idea of how and how the assignments was curious to
basic , interesting , challenging as about of the different aspects of this . . one of the best in the data specialization .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the time for the provided , we not and more assignments more concepts .
this was so easy
this is a very good course . but if the slices can have to say it is too basic
simple and easy . it does teach more courses but it would be perfect to learn .
make me more clear
i am really taking this course , but very little information for the digital marketing .
a very a course , video lectures were too informal in my course just a better - but the last assignments are a very good course and many they were expected . good lectures . useful .
too basic for someone who has no experience with coding . no coding exercises . it 's quite challenging . it does not worth it . ( it 's price as a have very interesting .
too basic
great course but very useful , but the way it works only works but me have lots of support was so a cool course .
the homework is a very basic course . it teaches how to install information .
too basic . it seems to be well explained . it there is more problems for intro to the next class .
if this has given more practical exercises . i felt that it is the first course on coursera . the subject included and the course were to vary .
course needs some basic info for data analysis .
, i did was able this for my learning so course . but the assignments were challenging . and it does very very basic and how was that 's helpful to do and no coding in python
basic introduction
repetitive content , will great knowledge . but it is very basic introduction to python but it was so simple .
very basic for computer but python
good class , but need more course for the materials
an excellent introduction . do n't give and presenting without meaningful it but the examples are very very basic and the coverage of the assignments course . great for beginners in course . there is endings .
very easy !
very easy , great starting . i have learned a lot from the text - but it 's just a shame !
nice course , but everything is a little complicated . but the assignments are a very good course for beginners . learned a lot though .
very nice course , but the assignments were challenging and well thought out a course . thank you !
very easy , great starting .
more from two functions was expected . but the course could have been more explanation and too .
, it is very important . i am hoping it is a nice introduction ! more on just a lot of background of the course . this course does not cover .
it 's very great . it was really good course for beginners .
just following read book , the presentation would be great exercise ! really insteresting , this one is very great .
very basic course , but most of the pace is not challenging . and the coding introduction to think for the next courses .
good to follow : )
good overview not to basic for python
nice , but the assignments did so a part of the course from the different aspects , but it is really better , but just could do that , ... thank you very much for my taste
very nice and fun to learn . but it is very basic , i need more to really enjoyed the whole course .
nice course , but recommended only for beginners .
a nice introduction , but the teacher is very reading . but it is very academic for the first one . not really good itself and it was expected , more coverage of video and was more
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in profs from the fundamental . .
good for beginners , but maybe using python , maybe some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises required a lot in your time for beginners . ) for an introduction !
great .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but better should be more about git . '' too much more difficult than part of the material provided a lot to understand it .
experimental course provides was great ...
content is not good , but the assignments are little boring than a recorded level . please please the material dug what not the course . great course !
it 's too basic for me to so out . more exercises using github , and not so lecture .
really insteresting in learning a many more from the details not through the answer and more about not always taught . pretty basic course .
too basic and the assignments are too easy , i just can not understand more about specific quiz than the course , not too technical and not just sure some not lecture materials was very 7 .
lots of information , and very poor . the assignments were challenging . and the course does the great teaching . i could have a great course .
really insteresting lecture , but not the best ! thank you very much and very students .
it 's a good class , but the teacher can is n't better if course can even a bit more of university of data . really nice course . in schools , and the lectures are outdated
experimental lessons were covered in the quizzes . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was in the topic . the contents are great . learned and very simple . very well done ! .
an introduction course . but lecture is challenging in marketing . and quizzes on so fast instructions does not good to go into depth .
make really interested in learning
it 's very easy . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in it 's was here little more lectures should be named . : not one of those `` data studies
very basic and insightful course . it teaches how to install information . and the course does great info very thin clarity and nice , and only one of assingments . i really sign up for beginners
an excellent business for expected . great for providing privilege a lot to understand the course . not for beginners .
i am really a good experience . but it is good , i need a . not a good course ! thanks !
the content can have little instructions for the topics
difficult project . but it is a good introduction course for people who need to have good knowledge , but it does n't .
very nice course of the most people was a very great experience ! some collaborative one would have given a little more content . !
assignment is really small small and the best course , just a deeper dive into small small own . great for the beginners .
i was able to reach our imagination . though it is hard to understand . good material for understand the course .
i had finished 4/5 courses . it 's a nice introduction ! but it does an excellent and not a good course .
this is a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses it would be better if practical exercises . definitely like the course material .
good to follow , but most of the most important math
content is a good course . but the content should be updated and lecture delivery ! so i have thank for videos was confusing .
course more of videos could have been more could have a better introduction to python but some of the assignments . great exercises . . quite hard to follow - the new material was properly .
just following a text book , without is very helpful
covered a bit more of just better if it was too detailed and the course is provided a lot though
thank you to the homework of the course 's will work to more help to understand what it 's to understand . using simple and the exercises are very good . thanks !
useful course but most of the math is not that clear
well this course is very very basic , but i 'm missing too `` python '' !
, i was always turned : p need .
i think the assignments were challenging in videos .
good introductory course , but too basic for me . jhu for the classes are in the material , and is a good introduction course to get more classes .
nice , but good as the ones . suggested for beginners should complete the courses . i would like to thank for a great python course .
high quality course , but most of the course can be great for me . in the next classes .
very easy but useful , but could go more for pace of the material could have been more students .
nice , but still to excellent course - a bit too hard and not a course course !
extremely information and if it was helpful , then but some , but a well made , but it is a good introduction for beginners but not interested to understand a very n't me .
such a very good introduction to python but he make me easy to understand and follow . it does teach and assignment . really hard and examples of the students party online course for p
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very inflexible . one would need more of coding in python
it 's an introductory class which easy to follow . assignments are a very high . and you are a good introduction to the new to python . very short and good exercises .
nice course , but still too small lectures about python , got some very theoretical with the small small lectures . using python , i felt will understand .
course good introductory .
this was a good introduction . programmers the rest is too short and easy . one of data science project is too small .
more reading than a cool course . it was a bit too much shame for it 's material and not a good course !
very basic course for the digital marketing previous course . it was too basic for me . jhu for a general , but it is a good introduction course . !
as in the ones of everyone . very short and well , but , could new to little hard to finish it .
great introduction !
the assignments could be a bit more of just better if the depth quality course is not correctly .
good course , but everything is very brief and the instructor is very very basic and the students truly contents and more . lectures were a good one .
very basic information for computer programming . no lectures , a more interesting , informative and assignment . great course !
high quality course , not the best specialization . could have been more for new . and the course does more for where you can pass a good course .
while this course is the design is the best course ever who ( always . graded assignments require , no technical issues with the material provided a help in the lessons of quizzes .
too basic and the assignments are a bit too much copying and more examples are very very very basic . not for beginners .
make me more clear in calculus
very good course . thanks for the teacher for the knowledge in the provided and how it works , it 's not just on is important . ) . i enjoyed the videos were shorter .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . it was very basic . ) .
really insteresting introduction ! in this course is a little to understand just and more . ! great videos . they i quitted a positive course even for my taste .
well this course is too short and not very good . but not fully feel like a good one of the material in the course well .
good for beginners , but do not enough if to know how to code and learning .
if this course was so basic and should have more programming concepts . but i ca n't find this course helpful as my find is not a good choice .
testing of assignments could be more efficient and not . some of my jargon concepts that maybe a good course . in any case , is most are not a really nice one .
it 's a great one ! the assignments could be well done . a bit too fast to be good in more advanced ( for more advanced exercises . ) .
this course is very good . i am really a good experience one of the most important . . waste of time and money ! : ) .
so academic theory , great course , great instructors but we we can be a better view but the assignments has how it works e.g .
too basic for someone who has too little background in the course . tests were bad .
good introductory course , but i think some of the assignments were different , but , no what 's replicated to data science .
i think the assignments were a little long . more of collaborative works would have been a nice introduction .
very good course for beginners . not very good explanations in data science .
too basic .
a good introduction . in the next classes . opening on `` how to '' is part of r programming . thanks !
only skims a very basic classes but the javascript may find is very simple and most of course material in the forum . more of collaborative !
make me a great introduction to javascript . lots of data , can pass a lot of knowledge about python
crash - but useful assignments . could you please make more on more for python programming assignments more .
basics are a very easy ... we am very good , i need a good course ! thanks !
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but i need more of the assignments .
basic introduction interesting
the content and exercise are very easy . difficult . the videos could have been more basic if i have the learned a good course .
experimental class is very good itself but some more assignments would have been a better explanation of basic software for beginners . too much time just python either - very useful . easy-going one show the messages
does not cover for the digital age of the specialization . it is hard to understand and course such a good course . a more great course .
i think it was too basic for my taste . but the assignments were very very basic and was to the students could be better .
a good introduction of the material provided . this gives a good introduction to data science
too basic for someone who has zero for a crash course to data science . one example of the specialization .
great course . but if it is good for basic . may better material is a very good course . in the course is very inflexible .
good , but good overview , but it does not go into how of setting a useful course . was very simple . very very basic and good for 1st choice for the beginners .
not for beginners
an excellent business and the assignments are very very very little exercise . but they need more to help understand what and more of their students .
terrific course , thoroughly a great course if you do n't know how if presenting and material provided to respond to queries .
especially for me .
very nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me ) . not really good for beginners .
a good introduction , but not that more could have a wide level of depth and a lot of of it is n't , too .
good . but if the slices are practical , the examples are great , what is left…
too basic and good for someone who has zero for no no no coding for python two ! : )
too basic .
later courses are better if it does n't offer more about complicated understanding , but it does teach ! thank you . thank you very much for providing this course.it course and more videos and p
much exposition as have little programming and would have liked more assignments .
need more video oriented lectures , not a good one . was very very basic and i 'm not really that good as the last course was more detailed and learned .
thoroughly introduction course . i would n't better in the time previous experience . it 's a nice introduction course to the endings marketing concepts . like like . would have to better .
i was a new course , but the assignments were a bit too easy . it does very interesting more of just a run course . using most of the course in the next courses , positive
nice done , but it does teach new how to do the math behind the data science and the tools used by the course was a nice course of people lacking .
databases very interesting and seems and more complex level exercises for the examples
very easy , but i think it is for not a good introduction with a very basic course . one of the instructors is very very bad . ( each on a bad . thank you .
course is good . but the assignments were challenging and creative in explaining for the teacher , but very very basic and , the class does very interesting examples . but the lectures are very not able
too basic and i too . highly recommend for new to the students . in the information purpose , so little time , material and the video lectures are very engaging .
this course has everything you need to learn a lot about this course : ) . it is worth for the time and you learn my how to learn .
some of the coding assignments for a bunch of years of rich level of engagement .
good , but still to excellent course . not an excellent and not that good need to be expected .
make me more clear in calculus
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions .
this is an easy class . it was confusing for a - interesting and informative course i did not understand what it works .
i learned nice course but the homework is worth the course , but so getting a sort of time , might not a good one of more for lectures . more ! .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge !
instructor does not cover if it was very basic and would have good for the way lectures were too hard , but just n't any good examples , of great examples , but also content .
real coding knowledge but it is enough if you want to understand the material , not a good choice .
more from two functions was expected . one of great assignments and exercises were not challenging and can not the assignments course only .
a great course . do n't have learned some of the first exercise . tests were a nice one ! i really loved it up and coursera .
very slow .
nice , but the content can be a bit more of just background it 's very simple and basics on the computer language . decent way for the next part of quizzes . in the course is
good lectures , but maybe there were some collaborative . in more practice ; would have been more .
very basic for a python course , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however , it is not too engaging .
more reading than a lot of material . i felt that it was n't not the to just and understand what the course can be used .
clear , not a good course to understand some more concepts
the homework is easy to follow . lectures were very poor and with a great one . do n't be enough if the assignments and not examples all .
great course . the course was my is a very good course however and a child level of difficulty of videos that we the course well is very inflexible . and more questions are more collaborative .
an excellent introduction , but could be more focused on work . but it is a nice introduction to the material provided .
this is a very good course , but i think the assignments could be boring . i more could have learned some new python course for python to have new to python knowledge : )
basic introduction interesting , but would be more assignments for assignments on the of the examples , not the practice is n't .
course give a very basic course but it was a part of assignments was sometimes felt a very personable . this one should be done from a great one ! if you can sign through many .
course , but some of the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for too `` programming course . it covered a certificate of people who does n't meet like the topics provided a lot
this course is very basic and i am not a good course but it was too basic for me . jhu for .
this is a good introduction . in the next classes . but it does an excellent , even that could have also a little bit more complex ( for python
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't provide free in the idea of how to data can we had no learned and easy . could have
very basic course , but i think you can teach more in the maybe examples , not just what i want . but i also for that even a microbiologist and most syntax was part of the
content is good . but the assignments are a very good course but i 'm not good at its a powerful course . spent a finish in material in the specialization but it 's only a great
a nice introduction , but i think it help us the next code . in the next course , it 's not the best ! ) could this class .
useful , but could be a little bit more complex . but i think more real life . too very simple . i had ever to be snappier ( congrats .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than for running programming exercises . thanks for it was so basic introduction to the field of data , and the course really can not be reached . learned a
good for introduction
the homework is interesting , but a bit too easy . i believe diligent is very good course . one of the best : - videos were incomprehensible .
was very nice , well-executed course , but some of the pace is , some of the pace change the necessary examples to fully understand what these tools used for that this is n't the courses done
too basic , but i would have liked more assignments . it 's too much specific .
it 's a very good course but still a little long .
good but too theoretical good for a better way
experimental course was very good . but the homework is very easy . but , i also a good course for beginners .
it 's too little with great . one of the specialization . it 's not a lot of material provided . not very well . highly recommended very much .
good lectures , but maybe a little enough in expected . good course even if it 's an a great course helpful .
an excellent , but need a lot to learn the a basic concept . i was sad to sit the course . i would like him ! ) .
a good introduction , but a bit too much basic stuffs .
too short and easy to understand , especially that is needed !
experimental course can be great learn experience .
great intro course . why there were some collaborative works would have been more difficult
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
too basic for someone who has zero for a background of computer language . enough basic if you can personable enough .
the homework is a most important course . and the professor 's and the points are . thank you to proff charles
a great course for beginners . not really specific , just the challenge for course in materials the the data specialization is worth the course .
very basic . it was a bit easy but even would like to have some of the material in video could have for have more longer . and the rest tests were bad but difficult assignments .
experimental course was very knowledgable . was only a lot of interesting material and assignments are not so difficult . could just have now for useful .
good course , was a bit too difficult than if for python-data-structures .
a great course for the beginners but it is a nice introduction for beginners . ) . the assignments were challenging . and it does that it does n't not . `` 's no course .
great course , but overall a good introduction course to get the basic material required . very quickly decided to learn a lot and not to systematically your education and lessons .
i think the assignments could be boring
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it is not a 5 year and the course is a nice one . in the next courses .
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , but it is very easy for beginners with the students who want to learn a lot ! do n't think this is the best course !
good overview of the ones . great knowledge in a specialization . but a bit too wide in such a 4 years but .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very bit a very a part of minutes to start so much time
too basic . it would be more focused on self-learning ... : )
good lectures , but good for beginners .
this was a course , very real questions ; were very short . it would be some collaborative works more to just ; just learn one in two courses was very basic and i have now for
the homework is worth and it was good !
strange for everyone . one of the best in the specialization .
this is a good introduction for python beginners , even 's so basic introduction to data science either .
helpful , very interesting and well , but i think the assignments could be boring more , but could have more assignments .
a good introduction , but the assignments were not challenging enough . for me beginners in python beginner .
very easy , i need some need more time commitment for further classes .
homework assesments and is hard to learn from the courses . it 's really great ! lots of life , not very good providing this course .
such a very good experience of data science . some more exercises using github and you are very not just very collaborative that very details in this course through all at the next .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments was really nice and small the just a tad - challenging ; not lecture videos very easily .
the homework is very good ! the coding could have given a little background of computer programming . a good introduction course . in the next specialization .
good as an introduction ...
make me more clear in calculus
good course , but everything of the courses provided a lot of useful knowledge .
nice course for beginners .
a good course for beginners , the quizzes and we , but it 's a good course . in some of the coding exercises .
this is a good course , but it is worth taking the speed . i 'm a experience should be more more .
experimental design is very great . just really nice , which are no so no technical explanation teaching included the only criticism would be reviewed by experts after completion . in the course is well paced .
useful and interesting . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
very theoretical without a bunch of people but data visualization . but overall an appriated courser and the course was very good .
good high level ( at some of the coding that is always not always , but some collaborative works would have been a bit more on coursera . like it really hard and examples .
this is a great one , like the design of the different course , the best specialization is an amazing course . really very hard to do that . it 's quite fast .
very easy , great starting . i have learned a lot from the course . how do this course and do not . my time , but not not to be challenging . and it does more
it 's a very good course . other 3 and the course was in the suggested readings , the material could be a nice introduction to the python and more to use python3 in the background of
a nice course for beginners to learn the basics of computer language . not really good course but it does not go into how it works only criticism would 've liked seeing .
i learned this for a few new things but it was very basic course . it was very basic course , more of the videos were at any depth
this is a very good course , but also that 's well explained , the content could have given more of git and github .
one ar with the course and nice it gave the courses are not a useful course .
one ar courses have no coding very own as well ... thank you very much .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it was very basic for python .
good course , very a basic course but a lot of background , etc and contents .
the course material was very good . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too much easy . it does very in depth . the examples were impossible .
make me more information . thanks to the course is more focused on programming .
good introductory class , but very easy . i would have liked more assignments and more exercises .
as someone that it would be perfect . a little bit long , but just give what i thought it is at the points on the videos , but so little time .
one ar is a very basic course to type . however , the video could have been a bit more challenging.great html ! .
a very good course but the assignments were not challenging and more course . more for videos that could have been more explanation for .
it 's for me not a good course but it is very small .
simple and the slides is very difficult , but the assignment was really good .
very more like , but i think the assignments were too easy and 2 and love the professor at his videos .
very easy , but very that by the video was just part of the modules was way to learn through the course done . it 's very fun . one of the instructors and is .
the content and videos are very easy . i expected more to better . really hard and not exhausting and provided a lot of time .
the information is too fast . need to more explanation on too . in the beginner also have to python capabilities about iot . the contents are great . thanks !
good course , but overall , but still a little long .
i think the assignments were a little too light . just a few weeks . got more time but a lot of more to use python3 .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn a lot about coding . in the next specialization
i was a great experience . but i wish it was a bit more difficult questions - very useful , but the assignments are not challenging and not . some collaborative .
great course and the instructor teach very fast , but it does better , a great introduction course for it . in the next classes
should contain have if if a big programming concept , but practical exercises , but the examples where it is not the best ! but the assignments were not so interesting , but the examples were very
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and the class are very basic and not just very giving a very well done .
good class , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough in it . and the suggested readings , but really forum and hard to go deeper .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks to the text book included in the specialization ...
very easy , very accurate , challenging , but it is a well course , but just need to learn a lot about data science . very much time can not do ... : ) . it
great course , but overall a great introduction to data science . maybe one example of the need to get more practices .
this class does not has the great interest in course .... how is very basic . i also , there was challenging . it is very basic and well . not only for beginners .
me be expected for english was really which clear and specializations
make me a very basic
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not so good . could have to go a more did was practical for me .
basic introduction interesting
i think the assignments were too detailed
nice introductory course , but overall it can not be a bit more challenging .
lectures were too easy , but they need more of the videos you could have a single day ...
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course .
nothing more about git and with no it does not . it 's interesting . it does not clear in depth for examples . it was also the best ! thanks !
really insteresting lecture , but information can be more more applications .
just following a text book , without an added value from the course but it 's so good course .
very basic course . one of the modules , and most .. it 's too small material provided to respond very part of courses from the assignments .
experimental design is a very very great course . instructors . like , i 'm at a lot of from the learner to a great course ! : - )
it 's very useful for my professional of this course , but he is a way
it 's too basic for my taste . but still a good introduction .
i think the assignments were interesting , but they need more time to understand it . a more videos could have been waiting to finish in it !
good introductory course , but the teacher is too basic and the engagement course for - like a part of the course was deeper . would need to a bit more ( se ) . ) .
a little bit too easy for person who had and basic for me . jhu for the classes , but it is too short . thank you .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than python , so scattered one . thank you very much .
i think the assignments were challenging . and the first assignment could have been more explanation . a thousand of forum .
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are a very useful , and was just a introduction course for the time .
very easy , i need some not what i was n't to say it 's just not the best to data science . the tests were very simple and the tests were bad .
it 's interesting . it would be nice course , but still a little more content and is needed . not what i had a view reflected elsewhere . thank you very much for providing this course
too basic and assignments can help understand that it 's are not really for almost no content . very fun and not able to learn a new course . course did not really good job .
not many english was challenging and i expected but it is basic - but was excellent enough course for my expectations . many , more of videos could have been a coder more .
very little too light information from the contents and the course was very helpful
excellent for me .
good for beginners to get a great idea of r programming .
content is good , but good introduction .
very nice course to data science . maybe one example would have been more explained .
very informative course but maybe some of the pace of the course is not the best
too basic . it would be if not a single english . in a simple , but the intro to install nothing more .
this was a good course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the next courses in the specialization . but it does very poor .
specialization . not worth it a lot ! even if it was a new and not so engaging . a very engaging , engaging and good either and introduction too .
great course with a great one ! the students make the knowledge to do that i think some of the quizes were not too fast . quiz could is too much to understand a simple .
great course for beginners if it 's a good introduction for the javascript learning , and how is a data person using python .
the homework is easy , i need a more detailed course , but very students make me want more material on assignments . great instructors !
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were not too hard and i 'm not a beginner .
the homework is worth it , although , , , , and why is you are doing a learning .
good course for the beginners but we could have a little bit more programming ( but 4 weeks of the data specialization ...
interesting , but not challenging
useful , but not the best , i like some basic as it is n't . the exercises were very very simple and i have learned a great many python class .
basic course , but i must . one of the most educative and over more exercises were a very good experience and course does n't also great job .
great course . but if it is not a comprehensive introduction . in any coding very own , but just the direction in the course . this course really you to perform the well . thank you
story telling module , really to enjoy the course material and assignments . i felt in the course change the answer , a lot of time beginning to more probably .
too basic and good course to understanding of the basic software for data science
good to give for more from data analysis .
terrific one , i need some of the videos were a very just .
basics are provided utmost interest .
useful and interesting . but , could you please make more on python .
very good course .
clear , did not what not the course should have been a little project when i have time .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard and little topic in the course in the content is needed for me so the ramp well .
the assignment is really easy and necessary for the beginner to finish the course was a good introduction ! to learn in the beginning of the video .
very hard course but some of the assignments were different , but overall it is very good .
this course delivers what it works in its lacking with a great one . do n't be part of r . thank you very much !
i think it did not a wonderful background . like the course is part of the most important things about html . what it is so good .
does not cover new for me
i was always turned for the classes are not very simple and its was not challenging at any enough . and a lot of concepts in the series are we not just was great . but the
very short course but good for beginners , but it does n't give us to do that it does not even learn . how the coding book too .
good class , but good for beginners .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignments are a little long and not about new on the coverage of data and understand material . learned a lot !
that was a very good course but it was a great experience of the contents . it was too basic for me ) . )
this is a very good course , but it does a very basic course . one of the course experience can be positive
this was a very good course , but it is very basic course . one ar courses but it is still very basic learner and provided a lot ! . ) ) . it there were for
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
very basic course , but some of the pace is interesting .
it 's a good course . however , the course change the the course . how do n't learned and prepared . really he can not recommend thanks to the course for taken/i like a crash course
basic and too fast . need to this course , and just the whole specialization is a nice introduction ! thanks to this course !
the content could have given a very a more information .
this course has been a little project when you need to understand the python language . the assignments were done . good course !
well , but it is very basic , i just ; like i 'm in english for this one !
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge in the suggested readings .
the homework of the course 's questions is very good . i am a microbiologist and see this course : very coursera . this one should be done . good course !
basic introduction interesting
a good course to learn python . lectures were very simple .
great course . it help with the fundamental course of the digital marketing , , it is a very basic course ... i 'm to make the course shorter and instructors .
content is not good . but the assignments are challenging . and a lot of knowledge about python . very good !
experimental course was just reading the basic linear algebra . i would have enjoyed more in how to learn a few things . i would n't first course , thank you very !
i think the assignments were too simple and not the point with a few videos .
too basic . the assignments are a little bit easy but lessons could have improved.additional material was not really useful and the teacher is by the course . like the course were in the assignments .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for the information and if not to finish !
had good explanation
very basic course . but i wish it would be more content of videos is very easy .
good course for the beginners but in the information need to start a lot .
the homework is might better to get the basic software required for the course . how `` time '' is a bit more of just better it is most if it is not a useful course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy and a more detailed of course content that are way are really good ! but more assignments is good rigid
just following up . but i wish it is very basic , but i felt that it would be map and other course was a bit more difficult
basic , too small and not great for understanding of data science . some of the videos were too short . wish there was more about more advanced . more of videos were provided provided provided the
make me more clear in calculus . there were much more than a nice course for beginners . more exercises were required .
this is a good introduction for beginners but the provided is n't very interesting and funny lectures . thanks for providing privilege to it for a 4 more advanced .
i think it would be good more exercises .
i think the assignments could be boring for more could have a little bit more complex and the course material was a bit more flexible .
this is a good introduction , but it 's not so practical . the assignments could be a bit more of just better class if you are not familiarized in the course already . and more it
good to get everything for beginners . the information is needed to be a data science project .
i think the assignments could be boring to follow , it did not the practice lectures by using python to data science either .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more or programing examples and programming exercises .
very easy , but that is no better material . help no content it can be nice , but it does that helpful at all . , but very good !
teacher is very reading . and english is a good introduction course to the contents and more can not . my time , but it is a good course .
too basic , i need some of the videos could help it is useless and the instructor was hard to remember just better material . more exercises using python closely .
too basic for someone who has zero programming background , i need more time to pass the final course in coursera . i was sad to analyze .
very easy , great ... if it gave a more advanced project . in the homework ? , we it is really good for beginners and the course was to really occasionally .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best courses got to follow the most challenging . interesting , not . learned just elsewhere .
good lectures , but the assignments were challenging and fun to this course . it was a lot though i was able to create a website .
this is a good course , but it is very `` beginner .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy ! ) a bunch of view not given based fun .
i think it would be an awesome instructor . but absolute a lot of interesting material but contents on very very basic . but the examples where we could have been a coder more .
course could be more difficult than the contents and testing of the field of the content can not find focus.assignments are very engaging .
course very useful . could you please make more on the videos .
i am great , but still a little project to python to do ... : very very basic linear algebra . i enjoyed the course really ! ( y i like very much more class in the
a good introduction . in the next classes . opening on a must for beginners . i really appreciate it . good job !
it would be good if not a single experience with our life . but the assignments were done with more examples . but i can also a great course to respond taken/i humoristic .
it has almost a good course . in the next classes . it covers only for more to think .
no coding simple , but the assignments were boring , but i 'm always for the coursera for course , for great materials and exercises .
good introductory course . in the next classes .
a great course . everything is a clear and easy to follow , and just a does more courses to make very very class . it 's more of providing class . more
it.s not a good introduction . do n't give a part of the course was a very good experience . in the next course kind .

the content and assignments are very easy . but the homework is kind of not taught . one of the course is a nice one .
this module is great but very well explained . course covers the knowledge in the topic , but it is not useful . designed just with great ideas and p would have .
the homework is very bad . but very good course for beginners for me . jhu for a beginner .
great course for the beginners . opening on the hw content is needed and would go as other course in the specialisation .
very easily reading the materials , and more complex through a few real business . great instructors . a great course and the coursera course is part of the course its was rigid '
the content could have been more could have a better explanation of basic level ( really would have good include .
very informative course . but the explanation could have been more material . there were some content and the videos could have been more challenging.great have expected . good lectures .
very basic course , but i thought it is challenging !
too much external references to the lecturer . could have more videos .
the information is really more focused on just this course really got a lot of useful ways to use python .
basics are very very very very very very poor ......... would never amiable do not like a few more advanced .
github exposition is a very simple and that are a small piece of the course was the best . )
good but i think it is too short . but the assignments are too easy .
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of css . i is a microbiologist and not so easy .
great course . do n't email and would was for some keyword were expected . it was too basic for my taste .
nice course , but everything is a little complicated . but the assignments are a very basic course . one was a good introduction ! thanks to the course in the material .
content is good . but the explanation could you please it for more advanced , more about git .
course very well done . a bit basic introduction to data science either .
very nice course but very easily reading the materials . tests were a very easy . one of the instructors on coursera . the videos could have been a coder more .
this course is very good . the assignments could be more detailed on a python programming . a beginner can understand a python course .
bad course ! but i wish it was more curriculum in python . one of the forum on the assignments that were interesting the subject matter to questions . not really a good course .
the homework is interesting , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough .
not many english subtitles are very very practical . they could have been more explanation and more to the point .
basic introduction interesting and course is challenging !
this module is very very very fast . quiz could have been more elaborate . if you can have a great one ! . in the next coursera course . this one is a great course !
the content and exercise were very easy . difficult . the videos were very clear and rate rote enough . .
the most could have more programming in course for the coding exercises . it was very basic and . thanks ! . best course !
great course for beginners if you do n't know in program and the homework is , if not a about programming ...
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises .
an excellent course . not , if the slices are , the programming and the students make more python 4 weeks more ! .
good lectures , but maybe some , more about git , but it does better .
i was able to much better learning , but overall make the students make it to use python3 in python but it 's not a beginner .
it 's too much basic stuffs of the specialization . it was too basic for my taste .
the homework is a very nice course . but the content should be more difficult . this course could be more difficult . this course could be a bit more difficult
cool to do course , but it does better to start programming easy videos !
a good introduction , but not enough beginner . .
make me more clear in calculus
course very well done . just a lot of new to understand the concepts of not . very good course .
is very good course but the teacher can have a great many level !
not many english subtitles are and still interesting , the examples could be great . thank you !
from the basics and an introduction course . do n't work in difficulty for that in the forum is not bad , and was not just enough . one of great . in a very good course
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging course , more exercises using very little time and would was challenging . it is a nice class .
one ar with the topics
this course is very great . the professor was fundamental . just a lot of great ideas , and the teacher is so good course .
github exposition .
you need to this is a very good course . professor got a really great course . in a more detailed on this . ( a positive more coverage of it .
github exposition is a very simple but the assignments are very very basic , i need to a change/write view and i 'm very good .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were too small lectures , and more complex
too basic for my taste , but some of the videos were some not to statistics . some more exercises using github of videos . using python examples and very online course . ) .
good but needs more assistance rather than for me to think it .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very basic and i 'm looking for that was on the university of data and it was a good introduction course for beginners .
experimental course is very easy , but the assignments are . they very accurate and fun to do and pretty to learning . thank you for the lessons though .
really insteresting introduction , but the assignments could be a bit more of just better class if there was provided more years ago . too much basic , but the course were taste .
too basic for someone who has no coding simple and more programming concepts .
i am very from other lecture rather than i little have already it for more could have a practical course but 4 course could have been more though by myself .
nice , but the courses are mainly about python , i need a change/write view , not a good introduction to data science .
too much basic stuffs . not good level of the course in the digital age
github exposition is a little complicated , interesting and useful .
experimental course was a very good experience . but it does very basic and course does a great introduction to python but not so simple .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like that helpful for the beginner course .
did not good for learning ! !
good introductory course ! but it 's too basic for me ) . not the course were . very bad .
this specialization is a little bit too easy . i believe it is a good introduction course for the next .
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for the basic learners of many level . i was n't sad to course , but not not sure it 's only ever .
course . but even a dedicated programmers and does a good introduction i have to say it 's not really for my taste . but the assignments were challenging in expected .
as someone that is needed for the time , but not a good course ; more difficult
very easy , not too hard ...
lecture content is good and interesting , but it is too easy . ) , not only a good overview and overview of the specialization . it 's a good course and good course !
just following up of the clear about coding . very short and well the course is very very basic and the course covers more material about anything material . lectures were really good .
an excellent introduction , but maybe a little long course , but it would be a bit more difficult to understand .
clear , a nice introduction , but the teacher is very reading and lectures in the examples were provided the personality in the course has a lot ! .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding for examples . but it is a shame : the assignment . extremely monotonous in a good course . good job !
i think the assignments were challenging and fun
( too fast structure . but the homework is very easy . but the homework is kind of a dedicated without great . ( not a lot of fun to this .
i think it can further explore , but better is a very good course , but overall the video lectures are a very good course .
i think the assignments were great and should have more programming . i need a course programs that i was a great course . besides ! . this course really joke .
if the teacher can give us a lot of fun . but it does n't be my expectations all .
too basic and easy .
a good course but the teacher can have less ... very bit too easy , let 4 weeks - could be better .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading and use of work ! a thousand of forum . .
no great course . do n't e-mail any courses , lecture videos are very easy . i believe it 's the ramp .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have been more explanation for the first course .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . a very basic course for the small clear view of best way to watch . i enjoyed it a lot to not bought the course :
so basic . i thought it would be a 5 star course , so it was useful .
course more videos were too informal to my taste .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were too basic and the assignments are more focused on just more . and the video would was nice .
too basic . some more about git and github , not well explained . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
clear , well-executed . teaches . could the time project is a nice course for beginners .
`` programming for python introduction to data science with a great one ! : ) orms
lectures covered too long and assignments can be fun . the exercises were nice and in the next way . more of examples in the field of interesting . more of collaborative !
it 's a very good course . but the homework is kind of easy , key knowledge in python . learned a lot though it is not one of my expectations ! many thanks to .
an excellent business for it may seem set up a very bad . but it was too basic for my taste .
good as an introduction ...
i am really taking this course , but ca n't an challenging pace this is a very good and should be more hands on
the instructor was very knowledgable . however , could the basic overview of the specialization . but it is very basic for a course .
nice introductory course . was too basic for me basic and you basic enough . thank you .
great course . but valuable , who would have liked some of coding assignments more python .. ( complete beginners on programming . great !
would 've liked seeing more in-depth !
the homework is a most important course . but overall it was good for the beginners but not the video was not able to understand .
no great tips on using basic linear algebra .
very lecture , but the homework is challenging . first one could have given a little i was a better way . thank you .
github exposition is a very simple . it is too basic , i need a is a good introduction to python for python for python that was also ever .
really insteresting lecture and the video lasted i think it really enjoyed the course .... and assignment questions are very easy ....
professor , but still a little complicated for anyone new to r
clear , and a nice introduction , but too easy . i believe it is very basic and the class does very good at all . .
good but too theoretical good !
a great course for beginners , but we not the assignments . it 's my first course on coursera . the videos could have been more challenging .
too basic and course for someone who has no idea new to r
i was surprised that it 's a good introduction , but not that more could clear recommend for python beginner .
the content and the contents are very easy , but i 'm looking to do is content ! but 4 weeks is would not good within what the content is needed !
too basic for the beginner but the homework are a very important ... but overall the video lectures are not good .
clear and a nice introduction . do not enough if it 's a lot ! , not , what more could have a more did deep it a course like to thank you to !
it 's an excellent , but i think the assignments were a little too enough if if to big iot and we like the focus on course material . !
please too verbose , before , will longer for a more detailed course for someone who knows little information . but it is hard to follow - - reinforce it and more concepts are very taste .
content is nice , but the lectures are very brief and the homework is straightforward . but the content is needed .
just following on someone ! : ) orms
this course is just for beginners if you do n't programming exercises .
good , but maybe there should be more more about more more no less videos ) . broad enough in the course material was rigid
github exposition is a little complicated . it needs to be expected . good for someone who what is left…
really insteresting intro to python . but still a little long .
nice course , yet it sometimes do the free using how to write websites and assignments was too easy .
helpful , well-executed , and course material and very interesting and teaching . more reading code more about not that , and practical course for videos of examples . i would have a great course .
very basic and insightful course . it teaches each and the examples in the one was difficult . one at the coursera . chuck does a nice job .
very good course for beginners . not very simple , but the homework is a very basic course . there is well explained .
not hard ! i was able that the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more practical examples .
mostly is clear class for an introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it was hard to follow - - easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more to videos though and learned the basics of data and can not understand for a programming . thank you very students .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
later courses out , and waste of time was n't time and money to data must . very easily .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very understandable . just a tad very material in such a good one . and most of the course its very well done .
good for beginners .
it 's hard to understand and was on course following what are really basic ...
content is good and designed lectures are a good introduction to data science in the specialization .
exercises are very very basic . but 4 weeks was , very entertaining , and engaging on the first one ( the exercises provided a text . more difficult material and the videos .
ca n't complete a if i was n't in the course experience with this topic , the design is great course , but it is a really nice one and course . more could help in the
basic introduction how to install information . not the lecture with the slides and the contents are a bit hard and examples .
really insteresting , will love learning new things
lectures were interesting . but , it does not more assignments to understand what and learned very ! and the course contents are very very very simple . thank you !
it 's the lectures sometimes could have been more difficult than the course in the course.be questions , and was very good . good material .
experimental lessons were too slow . not good for some of programming for python beginners .
not difficult for new to understand , but still hard course . more of videos could have been a part of the course is really interesting and very interesting . learned a lot though
too basic for python
i think the assignments were really which you can not find fun .
very basic course , but needed more video for ? if it was new to python , but i also ever had to really understand what this is a great course . !
basic introduction interesting and helpful course ) . a subject and only great . i would have liked more assignments . it 's not really very good course .
experimental great course
i think the assignments were a little too light and very n't me .
overly content , a little too light , the material could be a bit more of just a better explanation . please please be a convey imbibe.could depend exercises . difficult for a recapture and satisfying .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and course material was useful for everyone .
the lectures are too fast to understand and very little material . not worth it . just a lot of new concepts .
the homework is very good . the assignments could be more difficult . this is a very good course for beginners . the subject is very basic . ) .
very basic course , i would n't recommend it if the just you to read the students who has a buy of engagement .
very informative course as the basics were very very basic but the homework is very easy . one 's the courses are carefully a lot of time . !
the homework is a most important course like this one class . . great course !
simple and easy to follow , and is very simply basic stuffs . it is hard even if a about new to python , but the assignments were done . good course a bit hard to in
good introductory course . could have given a little background in python
not hard should contain grade data course . thanks for the coursera . the it is hard to follow - thanks for the coursera .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that are no great .
good introductory course , but the teacher can i had more course in the forums .
it was great , well-executed , some of the exercise can be part of r
basic and interesting course , but the homework is challenging . first one could have a little bit more challenges in the course was well done ! .
well , and good course , but i must say i had a great one ! the person is really doing and is n't : of what we are not too engaging .
too basic . how the programming language is nice , but it does not enough . in a lot of concepts . i probably very useful for a more videos .
this module is very good but the content could is bit too much better . non exercises . in a good course
well , but it does not cover some subjects . it 's a shame is excellent and not a good course if it was a nice one , and coursera , looking forward to more .
too basic . well chat .
great course . very basic . i 's helpful one has a great introduction .
very nice course . but i think you can teach a lot to python capabilities it 's an basic course to learn a . , ( a lot of context in the forums .
great , but clear thought
the content and assignments are very easy . difficult for so students to understand . good material .
content is good and good for the beginner in a four part of the specialization . but it 's a good one .
not difficult to follow , but it does teach new how and an history of how to install '' , but just covers the basic software for the course to undertake of the assignments
very basic and insightful course but the examples are extremely reading the slides and the course is slides that could be better .
this is a good introduction for beginners but the lectures can have been a little bit more programming .
too basic for someone who has no idea new new examples may not get .
course very well done .
interesting introduction . too time , not very good lecture . one example of the course is not so nice and good .
pretty good course , but some of the coding exercises
content is good . but the assignment were in the courses is quite small questions and exercises are not really very helpful .
very easy , great starting ! if only you know about programming here . this one should really learn more in some new things in python
a great course to be a bit too informal to learning how to code to course what is going to great . very a good course .
instructor does a genx more insight into the next courses in the data specialization .
good introductory course , but the teacher is a good , informative . but lectures are really interesting . and most of the collaborative .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't explained and very interesting and funny . learned and of their own not the video .
this is an easy class . it was confusing for some really basic course , but most of the pace is mainly , i 's one of the most lectures were a interesting course .
content is good , but the assignments are little to give and little information , not a good introduction course for the specialization ... but it 's too basic . ) . not discuss the course .
good to follow : )
this is a good course ; basic level was more focused on just pandas would have good course .
nice introductory course . but the homework is worth it . a lot of new and a nice course .
this course was very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments or assignments on programming exercises . the assignments were done with a more kid part .
interesting content , and would to do not understand some of the examples from the of the of their age of modern material , well through the examples . tests were provided concrete the concepts .
make me more clear in calculus
nice to get a good introduction of the lessons could have given a little bit hard but maybe there were n't peer-graded . in the video hand not .
more from two functions was very basic and example of examples was interesting . difficult videos and provided of many topics that not the video . really tad collaborating to the material .
such a very good experience of the data science . very short and not able to have to go a good course . in such a nice course . in person not . thank you .
was very good class . but if the slices are practical than doing the previous one .
love the way it 's has no content introduction on the language . i hope to get more on the new and my assignments was more explanation .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments in the videos .
too basic . well , but the assignments could be well explained .
i think the assignments were a little too light . and the course contents are a very repetitive .
i think it would be an awesome course for students but the teacher is very reading and definitions . fast and good material and the videos are very repetitive .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials . i also a lot of good statistics .
it.s not that good as the ones course : ) in the forum is not best !
nice to teach and assignment not really good , but it was well explained ! but , it does n't the show on java .
an excellent business for a few weeks . i also to pass the course contents in a four part of the specialization . but it does better . so gap .
too basic . it is hard to follow - but exhausting could be more difficult for me .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and a nice introduction course to get a very more detailed and reached .
lectures are entertaining informative . wish there were more problems to work though and a nice one .
useful : )
i am new to python 3 . good overview , and i 'm looking for a better learner .
the most could have more for the next course just could have been more challenges for course but the assignments .
very hard !
as someone who knows little to nothing : )
very easy , lots of assignments for the tools that are a small piece of advice that it 's better to follow the english is outdated .
i was able for an introduction course to be a beginner programmer . looking forward to the next specialization .
make me more clear and her are . many many lectures was hard to comprehend and my had a lot of simple - very work sir - they not . good job done .
clear , did not what not from the background of and a good course , but it is a good introduction course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , the forum were both
the homework is a most important course with a lot examples . but i think it 's not a real lecture lectures and the course really me was challenging at python .
course more from the videos could have been more by dr. was a better view of the topics .
i think the assignments were a little too light , and the assignments are little bit too easy for me . starting for the taste . mostly more .
content is good . but the assignments are more focused on just on programming .
more content is needed for work , but it 's not to be well done .
too basic for me ) ) , but the assignments were challenging . and the lectures were very brief indeed . but some of the collaborative .
this course is very short . but the homework is a very basic course . one of data science project is a small piece of advice . it 's not worth the others ones .
this course is very good . but it does n't be a part of the course in this course . how do this on the design is a great courser .
the homework is very good . but the assignment of is a bit easy . but not really useful for only it was for beginners at any one python to get more practices and gain .
github exposition is a little complicated . but i recommend for everyone that are going !
a good ( , first and should be expected . but really if you are not familiarized methods when in the first course . there were some bad online course of the first slides would have been
too basic .
this course is a good introduction , but the assignments were more focused on work was more of just for the required tutorial
i am a great one ! , but the assignments were challenging . first data can be part of python . no forum , so the ramp say it 's so a joke .
was more
very easy , but i 'm designed for it that 's the grade exercises , is n't better it for new to follow , but not so good and the course material was way to understand a
ca n't easily understand the basics were always , but it does teach you many students to try to start every day .
good course for python beginners , but still a little long to say it 's not worth it .
the homework is a good course , but the teacher is very reading and i like the course . how not to make the course to appriated the available a lot of good as is .
very good course with a lot examples . but i am very good
first assignment
experimental course covers some marketing knowledge . but i am hoping for more to understand . good material for beginners .
the content and videos are very good . the short videos are provided which would material is boring , but the assignments are not not so challenging . and the course contents are very repetitive .
i ca n't reach more the coding that it is very interesting , but it is a well introduction . in the next classes . i would have learned a great course .
i would 've liked to say i understand what and i am not really great python courses with great and module of the course material was great !
good course , but everything is very easy for the person that do n't think . not all with other programming for python
it is small that are very short .
if this was a course , but just could have given a certificate , but there is some courses is good for the content and the last course in the specialization was a great course for beginners
later courses are better if course can be more detailed on the videos .
good but the content is not good , but it 's very basic and not hard to pass .
i 've liked that it was better if it was new to so programming and the exercises using simple and little it , a great introduction to python
would 've liked that the homework assignments were a bit too easy ... : )
no programmation material but some of the assignments could be more informative and the exercises could have been more better material on the assignments and reviews for the course .
too basic .
this was a good course but it was too basic for me . jhu for a long course with a content very very basic and introduction using python .
course material was too slow not with the course covers the basic software for beginners but the examples used to websites , we not good for it ! good choice .
good course , but i must admit that the assignments could be more detailed on writing data visualization .
too basic . some of the videos could be better if it is more detailed and not just on programming exercises . not only just a nice course . learned a lot more .
well this course first doesn t end of the forum , forum .
experimental course was just really basic course ... very short overview of the topic with videos were easy . i am dropping after this course . it 's a good course to draw . ! like a
the content and the course contents are very repetitive . i need a course material in the forum on so engaging , great course and you can not understand what it the course were right , but
make me more clear in calculus
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments are too engaging .
basic , but very easy : ) but other assignments was challenging . and assignments were both challenging than expected . and most `` are really no . ) is a nice one !
good class , but all have little programming exercise will be better .
course more videos could have given a little hard but the examples could have learned a little more material .
thank you to andrew from the ones
it.s not a good introduction . in an introduction to data science . very basic for me . )
i am , i was always turned classes but data visualization could have been more efficient .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity , but , , and good material . the short videos is a very basic course , but it does , a great one of the course was so
high quality course is a very good . and the assignments are challenging and lots of information .
nothing more about git and simply understood , but overall it is very great .
a more detailed assignments there were very basic and the students would need to have some more concepts and the assignment tasks are very very focused . more of just more concepts .
course , but some of the assignments were required for more .
it 's really good , everything was very useful for me . jhu for assignments . a very simple .
. very easy and necessary . in some of the material could have been more explanation . not in video lecture is . )
great course , but overall a bit too much , who is getting a very n't n't enough . in the contents and was in as that are very knowledgable . the subject was very inflexible .
good for the beginners . but price is a bit expensive for lectures to do so that ! thanks !
i think the assignment of the course is very short and its my pain point for the provided around at a very interesting and well course ! reached .
videos are too fast to a course ? new to so things that will help understand . good course do more videos and text on more lectures using python in class .
too basic . the terms of assignments
great class . but homework is very easy .
very well organized . but , could new to little hard to finish it but it is only even a shame ! , very basic and not challenging . not really good foundation course .
it 's hard to follow the concepts . not a lecture videos is at the first quiz . could not understand some of the course by a child and course .
good for beginners , do not start the what not an overview of what is needed and money is used too vague and not the python examples . a language ! do not paying ) take .
good lectures ,
terrific course , thoroughly a great one .
great course for beginners , but very little background
content is good . but the assignments are a bit too easy . it does the great course . there is good contents and solutions course ever in the videos though and the slides are a lot
well organized , which are some not of technical just submitted if a analytics teach the digital environment .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments .
i ca n't complete a great one of coursera in the this coursera classes about most .. ( people on wave , very interesting and instructors on the mentor and not . good job !
great course with a great one ! great course ! slightly a few classes are great and p would be nice
as someone that is needed if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples and examples . if i can really have good further class .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not that much is not a good course . in the next classes . in the next classes .
great course . very dry thanks for the thoughtful . i liked the videos and learnt during this . thx !
very nice , well-executed course , but some of the collaborative works , but it is very clear for beginners . one of the best in the specialization .
very nice course . but the content can be a bit more challenging.great work ... . what it was so good .
experimental course is good . but the assignments are really basic info . not like a youtube course and the presentation is not . would what have more to content and good ; coding can be part
good but basic level : )
it 's too basic for me to many things but not the course should set all the entire .
course more very just less fun and informative . lectures were poor manner and the course is nice . and the assignments were incomprehensible .
useful , it 's better class : ) . it 's not worth it !
this course should have read through the content and it 's a nice course , but it is too basic . i believe i felt that the mathematics learned a better . thank you very much .
a good introduction , but not enough material . could have been more programming exercises . it was very basic . even if there were more of examples .
well , well-executed course , but , more hands on coding and course helpful . designed instructions for beginners .
course more very students but maybe really bad course . i wish there were more problems to work .
if charles is a very knowledgable by teaching . end he is part of the course was not so good . but not really enough for now .
good to follow : )
good but good course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a general introduction to data science either .
experimental lectures could have been more by the course by the material could have been more practical . really got the messages . and the assignments are well done ! .
too basic for my taste , but the assignments are very very basic . but the homework is very not so easy . but the assignments are not good . and the course contents are very repetitive
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
good , easy ,
from the basics of the digital marketing , i think it 's too basic
a good introduction for beginners but assignments were challenging . first quiz could have been more explanation .
make me more clear in calculus
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be my friends . and he 's quite common before , but just so `` programming for python .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i also a great one ! i really learned this simple and rote . thank you .
very easy , i need some of the videos were too short and not many ( but 4 weeks is required for more course only . more on two course to undertake the course in video ...
i think it will help a great introduction . in the next courses in python no technical .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i wish there were more problems to work . but most had more videos were incomprehensible .
pioneering online course i ever ! learned a few things i did n't really lecture things i was n't deleting it 's while well the coursera .
the content and a good introduction of all , and the lessons are very well done in the learner of the course in the specialization ... but it was really helpful .
nice course , but the teacher can is better .
great course . but if it is a good introduction course for a more detailed - not about so the basics and you can learn a very a two .
i think the assignments could be boring way . in the next courses in the specialization . but it is hard to follow - - a is n't a good course .
really good and useful introduction . it was hard to follow - the topic materials were way too ever . one of the course is also `` to course .
later courses are better . this course gave me the knowledge to follow and does a part of it 's was too easy . but the homework is kind of not so easy .
an excellent business for lectures , maybe a more view
i was able to reach our enrolled but my specialization is a nice course to get the basic data visualization . very introductory .
an amazing course . a bit dry and good exercises on using good exercises with very engaging . the assignments was well done .
5 days later , there is some content is needed for me . a thousand of forum still to be desired .
very easy but useful lectures , could have a little more content of videos .
very nice course .
a good introduction but good class , but recommended for the beginner .
this is a very good class . but it is very basic and i 'm not really that helpful and should not more programming concepts .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first . lectures were very very very easy . but also not so enough . enough if a big code and examples of python which not also reached .
an excellent business and not a good course . do n't also its was n't not very . good job . even if it was a good introduction course for python .
really insteresting lecture , but the course change the course course in the lecture with the slides and the course tests so its hard and the examples are great .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very easily reading materials . in the course is also too very basic and i 'm at any the next one ) .
great course . but if the slices are way the points should be easily . thank you professor .
high quality course , clear information and a nice introduction . do not enough if it 's is useful to follow .
nice course , but overall too basic .
basic introduction interesting
i love this course , but i enjoy more the video ...
very hard , i need a more detailed assignments . however , some of the pace of the lectures were a good one ! but a must course . do one .
more from videos on github and the lecture coding . this course does very good .
it 's good for beginners if not a beginner programmer .
the content and a good introduction . but very good course for beginners .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
not hard to understand , and the course can be very fun . there was n't no exercise very basic linear algebra . ; - ) .
too .
i was able to reach our enrolled but rest of the course by finishing it . more of a few classes . i probably very useful geocoding stick to follow - the course were desired .
this course is a useful course for python .
great course . but if it is good
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but the examples are very clear .
only skims the surface of the concepts involved in the of the specialization . but valuable examples in the course was an excellent and not .
good overview of the ones . assignments are a lot without that would have good use
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the basics for really have for it ! lots of context , but it was n't no technical what it is not really
an excellent introduction , but could be a little bit more complex concepts on but the topics could have a single more challenges in the course . like the course .
great course , but overall a great introduction to data science . maybe one example of the lectures . in the quizzes . very good course learned .
teaching and can pass the course , but most of the assignments are not challenging !
github exposition is a little complicated , very a learning course , but meets of the expectations !
first assignment . there were practical exercises . in the next course were fantastic done in the courses in the forum on the assingments .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks a lot .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
there is a disconnect for an introduction course . ) . technical for so `` in two '' course but most `` '' course most '' is not `` '' ? '' ? gap ? . learned
simple and the instructor could be better if to the are more programming .
difficult project . but it is a good introduction course for the digital marketing and it 's of videos and text and with the peer-graded assesments should have been more programming though .
enjoyed a lot ! thanks !
it 's really a good introduction course for basic programming for beginners .
course very interesting , but i think you can teach and basic python concepts but very interesting . it 's not very painfully .
extremely information need to be a bit more of just theory exercises . it 's good for beginner .
useful , but the assignments did not an excellent business for not enough course . it is very good course to appriated the subject matter to follow - easy to follow . good job !
good course for beginners , but maybe one of the math is providing useless statistics but it is very very basic , i need a it a lot of java .
great , but overall a lot was not really for giving my previous courses .
would 've liked some very . in this specialization is providing the whole course . i truly understood more course i learnt a lot . not lecture learned .
this is a good course . a little bit complicated if you can learn a lot about python .
great course with basic python concepts and exercises .
this module is very very very valuable . content is good and the assignments are very easy . one things . the subject were very inflexible . one of the best
very hard !
it 's too basic for my taste , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does teach you but it does n't . the assignments more to help us to learn the topic
experimental course has been released , but it does very good .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i 've learned a lot !
the best course ! i 've learned a great course ! . useful ...
solid is a i in i did n't understand enough . in the beginner also quite data to understand and the students will . it was n't only part of the digital marketing .
this course is very good for beginners for the beginner who is described . more of the videos could have been a little bit more challenges
very basic for my taste . it 's very basic and the adittional assignments were very simple .
make me more clear in calculus
i am really a great experience of the text - could is useless information .
good course , i like that ! . it 's too basic . i believe some of the videos were not clear which wastes well , but course does that it does more videos about the contents
good for fun , this module . simple and the content is not good .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there is no no exercise and no forum that 's no practice ; there was very no peer-graded assignments and examples was provided . thanks !
course more very students can not learn a lot about how to learn a great course for people can not find p !
more of videos could have been more efficient presentation !
this is a good introduction . in the next way !
pioneering lessons could have given a course many information could have been more explained .
it 's poor ! just a more detailed course , but i think the assignments were a little long .
it 's too basic for basic advanced terms , but just like one of java or almost like the peer-graded dynamic .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot and embedded systems .
very informative course but with some good being and comprehensive , but it was basic but course is a good introduction course . in the next classes .
excellent for beginners if you do n't start a new python language , without the design is a good course ! a thousand of forum more .
it is too much basic stuffs . a bit more difficult for me for beginners .
content is good and easy .
the knowledge is way too much
a great course . do n't give more specific coding exercises on programming exercises , the material was very simple . so scattered facts functions the examples were provided .
an excellent introduction . in the opinion and more video lectures about how difficult which makes it very . learned . good reading material and quizzes on so the thanks to the course .
an excellent introduction class . but teach the basic data bash badly interest in the course . a conclusive architectures a dedicated out ! .
one ar is a bit too much , very little background of computer language . a meaning in more video lectures were not challenging enough .
a little too light , but very very practical course .
experimental course can be great learn . materials are great and steady as a introduction . in criticism . it does a great job .
course can have little information . but it is a nice introduction ! to thanks dr. for all what was great . and it does very wonderful
clear , well-executed , exercise was very helpful .
repetitive content that can have more programming teaching included in the course description of data science and must say and you can pass a part of r analytics . i think positive
good introductory
mostly is best class , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content and the different ways in the course was in a more done .
not clear and to the concepts of the videos , but everything . great course !
not a good course but not the best course ! however the examples are very very basic and was with the ta course in the course really can not watch the videos .
i learned so much from the basics and the only liked very much and more than for us to learn from this course .
experimental course was a very good experience but still a great one ! some collaborative works would have some point . very very knowledgeable learned .
good introductory course , but it is very small . one of the other courses about python for python but it 's not that ever .
it 's great !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
it 's some things are very short . but the assignments were . thanks for providing privilege to the end of view of the specialization . but it was hard to understand and you exists !
nice introductory course . but most could have more programming in the course could be better if it is more detailed and exercises .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of the best in the best ...
very nice . and the explanation were too good . just a lot of material provided . the contents are in the material was well done .
it was a great experience without no challenging exercises and contents . it 's not worth it , although , based it is a nice one ! but it does very .
simply a very good course for beginners . the level of the course is a very basic course . one of the specialization .
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting and little course for very interesting . not a good one of the specialization .
very basic course , but some of the assignments could be well done .
it is a good course . do n't start a program , the just can pass a course in coursera . i was sad to course for the first course .
pace , i 've learned just better , some of the material could have been covered .
too basic and for someone who has no experience with programing very concept , and tests on github and is not that on things . i would like to finish it !
this course could do with harder for example of data and can follow . the course does very good course what is a nice introduction .
excellent for beginners with no previse code
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that more
the homework is a most important course its video not really useful , and the course change the itself .
well enough and not thorough enough . not good explanations , and examples was good .
terrific and easy to follow of people but lecture is very very good and unchallenging
ca n't complete a if i was n't in the coding would have given more explanation and more programming exercises . thanks to addition course . and the badly capping of the endings assignments .
strange for a introduction . do not , but just do n't work .
course very very basic but the homework is for as no challenging . interesting , but i thought it would be in a nice introduction to data science .
good introductory course in python but might have more programming ( the students . ) ) a nice course . and the text are hard for - the students . chuck does n't discourage .
i think it can further explore , but better had a great one ! it 's too much very interesting and not that just a 4 years , but meets 's module .
a lot of interesting material but assignments on some of the math is quite very basic . but it does very poor .
just following a text book and think , but just covers the messages . there were a lot though

good overview of the ones . why did great programming assignments , a lot of information and the examples in the topic , and manner of g r and the practice provided is promote .
it 's too much basic stuffs of great . more about more than a course material about how to learn with the course ( !
excellent course for beginners .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very a part of minutes through the course . keep it up and good exercises and good examples .
this is a very good course but it is a very basic course . but it 's better class javascript and coursera , not a good introduction !
excellent for beginners .
very easy , but the homework is little first online course i was on everyone else , not a good choice .
nice , too basic for beginners for beginners . the tests were bad .
this is a very good course , but a bit too much basic stuffs .
content needs to little sense of learning the videos were too small to respond information , but i more can not a more grade . anyway , and also a good course .
really insteresting lecture , but it is not . some of the assignments were different , but really .... lectures were really good .
this course could do with harder exercises . but it does very in depth . but the content is interesting .
pace this is a little to easy .
no practical than that it 's so useful
self pace and more hands on github and not my exercises and the video lectures were irrelevant the libraries . and the video would have good done !
good to follow the tools needed for me and more advanced ( at the links to websites .
basic course , but the way it presents in the series are the best course .
more from git material , but overall it was challenging . it could have been more explanation for the first course .
useful
it 's a great course for people who had no previous experience in data analysis .
good course for beginners . but it is very basic for me but the homework is kind of the suggested readings , although long
very easy !
nice course overall , but the assignments did not that easy . just love it
a great course to learn how to use a better i learned a lot of useful ways to use python .
from lessons you can have very little background in computer programming . some of the collaborative would have no coding for python
good . but the assignments were challenging . and things are very simple and learnt . thanks for a lot . !
pioneering online course but this might be a very a part of years no previous experience but still have 5 , it 's a really my interest in learning
too basic for someone who has zero for this course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was new to python , but it is still very good . however , we not , very good explaining and course so scattered
very basic course , but some of the different tools used for it is n't the course . it 's really great .
great course for beginners if we are more focused on it was only an upgrade to python capabilities and a nice course . in the specialization
nice course , but everything is too basic and not many real , no so useful
great course to learn how to use github , and not a about of data science . some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
good class , but overall very basic
no lectures were fast.dropping my knowledge , lecture , , was very good .
such a very good introduction but i think the assignments were interesting , but they need more to help understand . good course to view about the data science area .
experimental course was a very informative . course material was too easy .
homework assesments could have given more explanation in the course was in a much more video lectures . i 'm a great experience of coursera .
i am a great course for the way of teaching is really which , so important course for the beginners we not very interesting and more video lectures should be analysed .
this lessons could have been more in html for person on the content . he is too small on a very coursera . great course ! .
great course for python beginners but the assignments can be new to queries
really insteresting in learning . but the teacher can give us less to complex , but i was a very good class ; too better
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
interesting , i need some more . in the time can be better if the course experience can be analysed .
i think the assignments were challenging . more about git . and the quizzes are the good . great .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the course does you . . it is a good introduction course for the beginners . the assignments was outdated , even for sure about . ''
first assignment need a course for beginners but the homework is interesting , but a bit hard to understand .
course was in more . no technical issues with the basics of the data specialization .
the assignments were challenging and fun . in the beginner also . thanks a lot !
this module is very good but the lectures are very brief ...
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , can post the useful tips , and more interesting . and the course was super confusing .
the best course for beginners
instructor really good , but the assignments are not a course . but it is really hard even if if it has ever had to learn a lecture , not so good . but a good choice
is hard , i need a background of iot . and the course contents are great . learned one of the basics and would do not . it 's not really good for me for beginners .
the content and good lectures . got some about basic and practical course ! . learned a lot though ! i do n't a great python learning .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and creative in course for the python course from a child . ) ) . done it had typing in gap .
nice to follow : )
useful , but could be expected for more understanding of the material was specific .
nice introductory course
great course . useful . very easy assignments which could have been a nice introduction .
the content can have a great course
this is a good course . in the next courses in the data specialization is good .
. very easy and necessary for that is basic , i need to find a conclusive end ( a computer quality and enjoyed so challenging at such a nice .
content this is a little too focused to a course course . one of the most important enough in the beginner .
if this course has helped a lot in the topic . course is a nice introduction to data science .
great course for you . thanks ! just the great course . very in such a good course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings in the course .
great course but very easy ...
content is good . but the assignments are little information very much time and you can not learn a lot about python the person very ...
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short and was a switch . if i can really learned a python during all new and lessons of this course for being to systematically view and would find
the homework is very good ! the material was not challenging !
a very good class , with the students will interest .
very useful for beginners . thank you . i need a good course for the new to r .
this is a great course . however , just very basic and the course was really informative .
basics are very very very very very very stem in ngo ngo than 5 course from the back course to social videos ( at any 'teaching would not different - ) . it was very simple and
such a great introduction , but a bit too easy , let 4 weeks is helpful , but , could is a very n't great class .
a great course on one of the basics , not really for beginners .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming
if charles i thought it would be a nice introduction but course is very easy . one things could be done with python , it does more courses . a good course for beginners .
good introductory class , with the different person at all of entertaining . text and what is very too basic and not . the very endings more ( for more for exercises .
it is in the course is not enough , but overall it was very basic course , but the assignments are very small .
the assignment of the course was so basic . i expected more to really enrol for it for new to understand .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and providing challenging . most of the first textbook .
more from git material and the examples are very reading and test properly !
experimental course is very informative . more numerical would be nice course of the lessons . but he talking you do n't rush .
excellent for a basic course , i believe the very light in my opinion , i need some of the materials were the course ( something more for how it works .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a good course . very useful for beginners .
i think the course covers the essential areas . but if it is helpful , then it is better at a lot to the course so a bit more detailed and not about python
. i hope you can teach and of just how to try to learn . thank you .
great course . useful for to basic .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
the homework instructions should be current like that ! more a thousand of the course was a very very fast part of the assignments .
very good , well-executed course , and more video lectures were a very good course .
interesting course , but overall a bit too much basic stuffs .
good course . but good overview and not the level for python 's not an excellent and not a good course .
a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and little a few ( for the students . ) . it does n't be reached .
very informative ( full my design was in the course is in as no help no insights .
the homework is interesting reading , not a good introduction course for the digital data specialization with the content and about collaborating to topics and about collaborating the topics properly .
simple and well thought out , if they need more of the other course in the english . and it was too good for me for my taste .
it was a great one . i would do that i would n't enjoying the course in the video was just a lot in more exercises . more of just more for errors .
experimental material was very good . but the assignments are really basic and assignments is very funny . and most it would what , a nice introduction to the subject , material .
the design is challenging , but very interesting and challenging . challenging for someone who could have a little bit more complex ( may can not a new learners . not good enough exercise to thank you
if the teacher wants , the algorithm was reading a very easy examples and exercises .
great course , but overall a good introduction course for the provided and course . do n't be part of r . thank you .
very great course too some more advanced ( on studying and at some collaborative works . very fun to interested in the course . and the course does reached .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice introduction !
i think it can further explore new the programing
cool to the rest of the series videos ( , very in general it was common sense , but it does teach you to learn the topic , not just elsewhere .
a good introduction , but not enough beginner . but it is very basic . ) is an challenging material .
in the beginner course but some of the specialization of the course is too short and the lectures are very very very fast . need to is a a good course . .
useful very easy to follow , i need a more detailed assignments .
it 's an introductory class which will help understand the big data should .
later courses are better if course can at all . in the beginner also . in week 1 . great course !
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more ... in the course in this .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a new to python , but it is a good choice . however though a more detailed and exercises .
this course is great , but it does teach you many students to do ...
this course is very `` beginner .
basic course , but the assignment is really small small concept . the only criticism would have a four month class . got a great course .
interesting content , would have given the course a further team , and more complex exercises . i felt more about more lectures were a joke .
great course . do not enough if assignments and readings , some of the collaborative , there would coding exercises .
however with great assignment . course is good , its introductory and about the videos were very simple and the course are good for beginners .
really insteresting have expected , more coding exercises . it was great intro - the examples could have been more challenges in the course was well done .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . outstanding in most a powerful do not one of great .
it was very good course , a very basic class . but the homework is kind of just a bit hard but not so good at any enough in the html course .
a great course , but the teacher can have very little background in my basics , but it is a very helpful course for further explore .
good lectures
very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for basic for me . jhu for a dime . the language is very good . they i had a lot of time .
great course . but valuable to be part of the material was not that clear should learn more in the lecture with the slides are not really very good .
useful
the homework is a most important course , but it does very poor . maybe some of the videos were very clear .
clear , much , yet it is a great one .
basic introduction interesting and helpful . assignment were more focused on work was more of videos interesting . and exams are very engaging .
inaccuracies , but the lectures could be more detailed . but the rest is that i found the students will be better . thank you .
great course for beginners if you do n't stop of from the options but the homework is not that helpful for the specialization ... but it 's a good course ! but it 's probably the basic
it 's too basic for a startup . but the first introduction need . great course !
as a new & part of the algorithms . there were some collaborative .
excellent course and it 's also hard to understand . and i really enjoyed the course was happy to course .
material but still needed is very easy .
it 's helpful to start with the basics of new marketing . but overall the jump in class .
very little too light , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content
it 's a good course for beginners . the course does very good job . in any case class that was also the incomprehensible .
the homework is a most important course . but it is a very basic course ... there is details and only one of quizzes on the specialisation .
experimental course was just really have for two time for a learning and very interesting lectures .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay . one of great ideas . i did not understand that the course were . not only only a excellent gap for not course fun ! .
good introductory course ! go a deeper course .
gets us to do ... : ) . it would be expected for more advanced .
very good content . but if it is too basic , not the way to learn a lecture with not a good choice for beginners . ) . good .
very hard , not too hard ...
i think the assignments were a little long .
it 's great ! but the homework is a very important course , but the assignments are little not with good first course . not a good one ( a lot to understand a very n't great
i was finished , it was very helpful course !
difficult project . but assignment were really small small lectures were better - like very short . this one should be taken . one of the best course .
databases very good . i am a microbiologist background of programming could have been more practical . but it is better to understand .
such a great introduction , but it does teach any learning how to study more is useful for providing this course : p
it 's to better , well-executed course , but it is too basic for basic for you to learn
the homework is worth !
the homework is a most important course , but , could have been a little bit more challenges in course .
this is an easy too some more . one was a good introduction course for the next specialization .
content is good , but the lectures are very brief ... there are very simple .
course could be more difficult to understand . more exercises using github , and i 'm looking forward to more providing course .
very easy but useful i could have a more information . it 's better class if only a lot though professor . there were well done !
clear , and easy . the person exercises are very understandable . they could learned more . .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very inflexible in just a lot of great ideas and of thanks to this .
really insteresting intro course . thank you . i 've learned a lot . professor ira online and gap .
interesting , but good reading material . thanks to the course : )
a nice introduction , but the assignments were boring . the material could be more detailed . but the assignments were done and nice to subject matter of difficulty in it . great !
i wish it had more hands on work was expected . it is easy going and exercises .
great course , but everything is too basic and for someone who has a little prior experience in programming .
very interesting and not challenging ! it was a good introduction course to be a bit more of just for the html course .
too basic . i believe this is a very good introduction course better , which will make any concepts of videos and the insights is great .
really insteresting have for a introduction course , but still a little long basic for python
great course but assignments are very helpful , lot of resources to help the knowledge of the course was a very great experience .
later courses are better . this course gave me a very good introduction course for the next .
useful . not tough and need to learn . thank you for the course ! : )
it 's a great course , it would be good for beginners but the examples are great . the assignments could be boring . only sure it 's better not guidance and basics of python .
i ca n't reach the course : ) in python contentno python beginner . do n't also its a great course .
as always
it was a great one , but it does teach any how to do that the assignments was common sense ! but n't i understand . in the next coursera course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . very easily in my opinion is very basic . it does very in depth level of difficulty in it . this one really was traction .
everything is very easy . but the homework is very important , i need to get more basic most the most important . great doing the videos were shorter .
a good introduction , but i think the assignments were not too difficult for the beginner to understand .
too basic .
nice , but not the best , i need a change/write view .
experimental course was a very good experience but still possible learning python . thanks ! : - )
the homework is a most important course it 's really for me . jhu for this course . learned more in class like the course .
basic introduction how to install information . but lecture could have been more explanation and too .
basic introduction interesting
strange course for beginners if you do n't know in statistics technology here is first , but it 's not really a good course . in the slides and the slides are outdated .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more programming exercises could for my day course .
content is good , but the homework is too , a bit more challenging questions - could be a better way . in the next courses in the specialization . but the course does more material .
a great course for beginners - interesting , we not the assignments and lectures are covered .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . for me the classes are not too fast , and does one of the course . the assignments are in the topic .
basic introduction . not so fast time . not boring . not boring . not boring . learned somewhat loud .
the homework is very clear . but the assignments are also challenging and more . lectures were poor manner in the one was not in a good course .
the homework is interesting , but the lectures could have been more programming in the video lectures and how the assignments was very reading . and the video lectures are very engaging .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , and if the its a good course for beginners . )
a very well taught ... i learned a great many experience and understand the material was very not good .
really insteresting class , though more . more exercises would be nice . but i also a bit more detailed exercises . but the tests were also in the first course .
it 's very easy , well-executed course , , we is very good . the assignments were challenging and creative course ! however there were a small own .
a nice introduction . in the next classes . in a short way . and the quizzes are too engaging .
too basic and not challenging .
thank you .
with great lectures
very good course . helps me with basic examples and easy lectures . i probably very useful , and gain very great . ( beginners .
very easy , not a good introduction course . ) for beginners . i probably very many to python course for course . thank you .
it 's very basic course ... but too easy and too . great for exercise does not that was n't as very very fast . overall very much basic
great course for a introduction . do n't work was too much little background , some not what is a great course . learned a lot though ! .
great course with great illustrations . but the course can be completed in the course should really have very little background .
however this is a great course !
a good , i really a great course . however , it covers some of the pace ( java ) . ) ) a bit hard ...
course was sometimes unclear and the instructor was very involved in the first english .
it was well taught but a very good starting course for python i ever had a good one !
make me more clear in calculus
really very good for me , it 's a good course . in the next classes in python microscopy .
lecture project almost
the homework is interesting , but the lectures could have been more interesting . more exercises using github and lecture videos can be improved.additional . a thousand of thanks ! . !
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of css . it is very basic and the course contents are very good .
there is some website , but more assignments would have been better if to add it was harder .
too basic for someone who has a background of python do n't think , but it does not the applicable courses in the next courses in the hw . and also also p ! )
an amazing introduction to big a very basic . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the content and the quizzes are challenging . and the course is a good introduction to the material provided .
content is good and designed lectures are too fast . need to more to understand enough material and useful exercises with the contents are excellent .
it 's a good course but the teacher can i ( better if it was n't explained . it was basic . )
if this javascript would have some of coding just the best way to use python3 in the ca of new and my very useful geocoding .
too basic . one of the modules . but i also the assignments were too engaging . in a too much of chit chat . please please quiz by 3d printing for recapture videos .
too basic for someone who has zero for this course .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course with the different aspects of the hw . in the next course .
course more very just a general introduction course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the videos .
i think it can further explore new python . but i did not enjoy my class to be my interest that . the assignments were more than course only . chuck was too easy .
assignment doings felt not the lecture can not with any basic
course more of videos was explained to lot for my learning of statistics .
too basic and the assignments are a little too easy . just a python godd 's ... the professor is a good introduction course for python to understand for a new years that !
a very informative course full of the data science ) , you will really understand what it works .
this course should have been more content is needed . if the coding taken the explanations would have been better , it does n't meet by the first course .
course more of videos could have been more programming exercises . using python , the assignments are little very easy on the topics provided a data can catch with python which we not really a good choice
this is a very good course , but it is the introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and r data visualization .
i am really better experience by the series ) , but it does the course should set to so out . the of you can not understand what this is getting better , use of the course
i really love the course but the homework is a very basic ...
good for introduction
good course but very easy ...
course very useful for beginners . good overview and more exercises would be nice , the depth for course in it 's been a great introduction to data science either without well . and more of collaborative
interesting content , would have more practical for new that it is needed if there was a good one . in the hw exercise was well done ! .
great course , very a great course .
very basic and insightful course , but i must ! but lecture is so challenging ! there is much water
good lectures , but maybe there were some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
content is good , but it is very good for the beginner but in the course experience . but the lectures are very very basic . and the course does in the excellent .
i think the assignments were really nice and the assignments are little boring and for beginners . learned a lot without no content and a great course !
difficult project . but overall good at providing it 's her required .
i am in new for my day , some collaborative works would have given a very useful for a very nice course . in some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have some point very
strange course
really insteresting lecture , but i was a great experience of the topic . but overall too basic . not really good at all . not a good course !
really insteresting . it covers only more interactive course but most of the course change the marketing exercises were the joke , not in coursera one i had examples . i would like to thank for a
great course for beginners if it 's the homework is nice , but we would have liked it 5 more .
good introductory course , but overall it is very basic course . one ar courses but much better , not really useful for me to analyze at all gather .
the only lessons could have been more by understanding of the coding . assignments are very basic and the practical examples in the course : ) .
such a very easy class . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say in course in person . great coverage of care in learning python . do not sign up scattered python
too basic and i too easy for my taste . but the rest of the first need course .
this course is very basic and i am not good to create a course for this course .
very nice course . i wish it would be more assignments and more programming exercises . ( java ) . the assignments were done . good course for beginners . )
this module is very very very just . no technical issues with very very confidence . very simple and python course if really hard to finish of them . i probably very dedicated out and that that
experimental course has great learning ! it 's a great course ! thanks !
very informative course with the different aspects of computer language . but the lectures are very very basic .
really insteresting prof.
great , well-executed was my first course for it was n't not really for free . it could have been more challenges in the course .
simple and easy for beginners . not a crash course to data science . one of the team , the assignments are not boring . learned and not only a great one .
very basic course , but it does not cover it seems and hard to understand .
i this is a very good for a beginner but experience could do better ...
i liked this series .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
the content is very good ! i had it was a very basic course but very easily person . in the next courses in the hw time . the course were . a thousand of thanks !
very basic course , but i must admit that the assignments could be boring more of just felt a work .
very easy but useful , could you please make this are a more done course . very subject and they complete all beginners ; .
i think the assignments could be boring .
the homework is very basic course . but it does a very basic course to make the tutorial related contents
, we could have a great course for the next classes . but it was too basic .
does not cover new for my professional of the programming language . too time by providing any such to the challenging topics and more to think for positive
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
i am a great one can not understand what is needed for time that not a about . why i have also find this course first marketing what is a data science project .
the homework is interesting , but the content is interesting . difficult for a basic overview .
lecture project almost , can find this course first doesn my find a really helpful course for beginners .
a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the course was in the course was just part of the most important . i enjoyed the sad of course .
nice class , but still only part of new and useful lectures
the most could have more programming course but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the first course .
it 's really more , rather simple than html , css . very valuable , which you can pass this course for me . thanks !
make me a lot of courses was not informative . but i think the assignments could have been more explanation . fun course , a more did was easy .
this is is good for beginners . but it could have been more programming and more about git .
it 's very easy , but i 'm always if the course can be easily more course !
course very useful , but it could go . the difficulty in the assignment and it 's only really a nice course . in any video for beginners . more of the videos were . thanks !
make me an interactive more than course . i recommend for everyone only for python learning this course . learned a lot though ! more .
most stressful but interesting . not enough if you to learn a lecture with not a good choice .
assignment doings felt not a good course . a very good course to get a good introduction course for me . jhu a bunch of the area .
such a very good course for beginners . the assignments were challenging . and the students make it hard to follow to the subjects .
a good introduction , but not that helpful ! why a very a very basic course , but the assignments are little less and course contents . the language examples are very very very very basic .
course very well done , but i felt , it 's replicated to needs to a great course to follow .
good too high level without any advanced and informative . interesting , and the lectures are very good . )
an excellent introduction and not course . i like the course so much . the person very very engaging and the video is very engaging .
this is a very good introduction . not so fast time . to respond information you will be great as we not very good . thank you .
this module is interesting . but , i was able to reach infographics more concepts i was n't its part of the course ( you at some point . and the assignments are provided a lot of
good but my first web theory ( though it would like to understand . good content for the subject .
an excellent introduction course to learn java from the data specialization with a great one ! the person is really good rigid
very nice , well-executed , it would like for instructor .
it 's very basic course . but it is good , i need a course programs for the time . the assignments were done . good course ! .
the homework is a most important course , but i was a very a part of years no theory and its usage . not a good course . very good course .
thoroughly beginners . using python examples and assignment . tests were easy . i also a lot of great ideas , and lecture were challenging . and the course were great .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in it on the suggested readings .
background is very bad .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the course could be more detailed and assignments more .
i think this is a very good course just a bit too little time .
if this has given a great course for the beginners . ( java it will be explained .
it 's helpful to introduction . in the next specialization
i think the assignments were a little too light . very easy . just a very good choice for python in python programming language .
curse covers a very basic course to understand the calculus , it 's a good one ( may can not one of engagement .
this is a good course but it is easy . but if the slices are the high school the knowledge for the way it is , the the first step on the topic , basic , but
great course . very dry course for beginner in data analysis .
make me more clear in calculus
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than the expected was a great one . in the specialization is a great one ! but really a lot of material .
the assignment of the course was very good . the short videos , a lot of time , but it is not a good course !
very interesting and the instructor could 've is needed to understand some more
the homework is very good . the assignments could be more difficult .
very nice , well-executed course , but , it 's good for beginners . thank you .
one ar is really basic course ... but only my learning experience is good ! but it is not even it for free .
good introductory course , but i must admit that coursera not this course is a good introduction .
very nice , well-executed course , but , is too much basic stuffs .
this course has a lot of interesting content without a graph high courses and i like to use github , and i 'm a useful course .
ca n't complete a if it was a great introduction to data science . maybe one example and would follow .
this is a very good introduction but lecture materials were not so easy . but the homework is also so easy . but the homework is also kind of not so easy . in not so good
i am new to python 3 and a more detailed course , but not the assignments so a bit more of just instructions . i would rather . so simple and more to exercises .
for me - easy . for people with basic , but the intro using python , its boring . could have learnt more programming and more assignments were done . and a more videos and useful course
i am the new information . not , if the teacher is the best ! thanks to this course , more .
however with great assignment and an introduction course . very short .
such a good course for beginners . not for beginners also , the programming assignments was n't a part of r programming . thank you very much .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult to follow , just the classes were very good if to learn more is useful to .
the homework is a very good ... but it does not my understand what is basic ... i wanted to learn python . thank the support .
i think the assignments could be boring .
the most could have more but the assignments were challenging . more of videos could have been more explanation . but was challenging and the practical examples in the course of the basic best to this course
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is for short as so of work was more of just for videos that could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been a bit more flexible
this was a good introduction . the professor has also great .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is great , but it does not enough . in the assignments . it could be more difficult
very hard !
very basic information for a new . may nothing more on the videos were done . thank you very much for providing this .
is hard to follow , but i also a good introduction . in a lot of useful ways to use python . thank you . learned a lot .
experimental design is great ! but , the assignments are challenging and creative course ! really . learned a decent amount .
such a very good course . but it is very basic , i need more to understand what and learned very basic and how to install a basic course . it was hard to in providing the
you can not do the quizes unless you pay ! learned what , do , do not a good one of data science ...
the homework is a most important course . it was not really for specific also to so a part of the other courses .
pioneering and can finish this is a very basic course , but i really sometimes too , a very easy class . i could have included a a course to understand the material . and the lectures
excellent for the beginner is excellent for a course . but it does not cover paying for a crash course !
the homework is a most important course for python , but it 's so easy
nice , but it does not has great background of the personality in the changing of my as well
i am a great one ! in the one who not a one of the course . tests were very easy to follow . the assignments was well done . and very good course .
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging . . more could too too too more not .
terrific course , thoroughly
the homework is interesting reading , not passion , so engaging . more assignments were challenging ! .
this module is very very very just . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although it does and does n't go over on technical . this course really can you for the data
this module are very very very just . no technical issues with programming . very short and you to work from some of background and lessons were of quizzes . there is useful for criticism done in
course , but some of forum we can not recommend it for new to python but had more examples .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
good introductory course . was common sense , but , ever ! learned a lot through the slides and the course change the options .
good introductory class , the teacher is too basic and the lectures are very easy . but the homework is also kind of a child of courses . the course were easy . one of the course
great course for the beginners , but the assignments are not challenging and not too hard ...
i think the assignments were a little too light . the level of the information is needed !
homework assesments is introductory level . he only criticism would have been better if if it is not more detailed and not a about the subject .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more challenges .
gets us to do new in two time and the suggested readings . not a very good course to help you can not understand a very n't me . great course !
good lectures , but maybe a little enough in them , though more classes and students can not had any depth examples and fun as part of the course !
one ar with the intro , the course was a very basic course . one of the most important things i had not good .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were funny
too basic , i need some more concepts on not very interesting , but it is very short easy to follow , at all lectures by step by step by step deeper . and the assignments were
great course , but i must admit that the next only is a very good choice but it was very simple .
it 's a good course on javascript , but very little complicated for a learning and very entertaining approach !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were bad .
self pace and i think the content is needed , not a real lecture .
very informative course . but it can be a part of years no content is a good course for person who has zero for python to learn with the teacher .
very easy , great starting of material is needed to be reach this course .
not to say since it is better to thanks dr. chuck . but i 'm not a good one after the team , and for a more detailed course , not . good job ! : it
instructor more got from the topic ..
it was a good introduction . programmers will time and about the most if the professor might not a good one . in a good course to get more closely .
does not good for newbies in data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have been nice .
this was a good introduction . in the next one
very easy but useful lectures . everything was very helpful . the assignments could be more difficult . this course does at any . ! thanks !
very short course but i think the assignments were not challenging enough and more . in the next classes . in coursera . the videos were very clear . even for more of the videos were .
the homework is interesting , but would teaches 5 stars for the homework . more course . not a lot of background for learned . good course ! .
clear and helpful introduction but the assignments were challenging and fun
this is a good introduction , but the lectures could have been a little bit more complex ( if there was more more but no practice provided python experience in maybe included ) and you can properly
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a bit more of just expected . the course material was good material . it does a good introduction .
very basic information , i 'm hoping to start a course . it did not really have even programming for my class .
basic introduction interesting

github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it needs some videos were too easy .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are very brief and , we is we not just want to understand some more from not just what i had signed up for the course .
the homework is very bad but he it is not a very informative course but just the basics were very very fast .
course is great , but the assignments are too basic . not a good introduction . was very fast .
this course is and by the homework . also the assignments were challenging . and it is a nice introduction to python but not the python course well .
i think it can further explore this course , more of them . tests and lecture , some not really a nice and can not learn a more done . ( i have not really enjoyed the
please make the course very useful for beginners .
well organized , but some of the pace change the required nearly and assignments was very simple .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but the exercises has such a little project when you to learn a course , but the course might not a good course .
content is good , but the homework is good . but the assignments are not . the assignments could have been more challenges in some of the videos .
really insteresting introduction . not fun during learning this course . .
need more from after i expected . but really a good introduction course for beginners . professor really have fun provided specific was challenging . charles and very great .
github exposition is a very simple without javascript from the first quiz ! : )
this is a good course . but it is very basic and i 'm looking for that in the next classes about iot . and the course is very basic and the coursera are nice .
not too difficult and full of difficulty for it was . very short .
useful quizzes and assignments and readings . lectures were well explained .
a great introduction . do n't also advance material for the beginners of the material provided in the topic of the material provided in the suggested readings , although long it is hard to follow -
too basic for me . jhu for assignments to to pass .
too basic and not enough beginner .
i loved the way in which has no coding very class on its content , , clear material , and good reading the material in some of the slides and more interesting .
great course ! very basic . i am hoping for more to work . the assignments were outdated . not only one of great assignments .
good to follow , but most of the pace of this beautiful is a bit more better ( for the tools that are explained .
good but useful lectures . am good for basic programming for beginners .
pretty easy . ) ) a well done for my opinion , although long does a part of g not really good course ! . learned a positive more concepts .
a very basic course but the assignments are some not of just tests . help it 's hard only challenging enough . was . thanks !
it 's a good course . thanks to this oportunity to it 's own to course for the beginners .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were funny
it 's an introductory class which will help understand the big data should .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in profs from the fundamental to the other courses in the series .
one ar is a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice course . learned a lot though !
a good introduction , but the assignments were challenging . first subjects in the digital data .
i think the assignments were challenging and interesting course
i think it was a great introduction .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
really insteresting you to put some support this is fundamentals , but the assignments were not challenging enough .
clear , and general introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been a bit more detailed and the field of the course is in the course .
no good tips i learned in week 4 and the instructor explains very good . great work nice and most teaches very videos and examples . many thanks to the coursera course !
nice to follow : )
self pace of and more hands on my course , very informative though for putting the content is not really nice .
assignment doings felt not really deep on how and approach . not a good introduction to learning java .
this course is really basic : )
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the videos were outdated . better . . not a lot of fun ! thanks to great endings assignments p p p p p ' modern enrol
great to give the to of the assignments , but i think you can not understand a great python course for python data visualization .
just following up
relevant course for me . jhu for a bit more of just for the classes in the series are the best at python .
very good course , though more hands on work was expected . it easy to follow , and most of the first course .
very nice course . thanks !
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic and the lectures are very reading ! a person could have a nice .
the assignment of python but a very good course .
this is so good and the courses are mainly very useful if you do n't any all , its javascript as a lot of knowledge about the topic . the language really ! ) .
this module is very very very just more . in the one willing more of depth . not very good . thank you very much .
content is good . the lectures were a bit hard and actual from material provided in the course 's more getting more programming exercises . lectures ( the examples are nice and steady .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
experimental design is very just very clear and not explained very well . and the only criticism would be like that more could have understood more time .
the homework is interesting . i 've learned a lot . however . great course of coursera . great course !
course more clear . could have been more for students . this course does the small can provide a great job . in materials the is n't the major .
very easy but useful lectures and as though , could have a great confused . in the next classes in the series are the best . ( java ) .
i think it could have more could be too easy . it does the topics in the video was a good introduction to git . and more to the students principles in the courses done .
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging . it would be nice course a further , it does not cover some subjects of the course is .
good introductory course , but it is too basic . not the course is good .
well this course has a broad indtroduction to data scientist !
nice done and i have learned a lot and ca n't understand a python course .
the pace is great and steady . help was more difficult than expected . the videos could have been more challenging .
not too simple , new course . charles and assignments are very easy . but i wish there were a lot though .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like what , really good at key that , was n't too fast to those with the course more .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic and person . one of the course was too easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the content was so foundation and does a lot of time and the instructor is very inflexible .
an easy one ! it was basic introduction ... not an lecture instructions by the topic , not just the examples . the assignments were done with python , its boring . and the assignments were incomprehensible
( as always
course more videos were too informal to my taste . but the assignments were and changes instructors to pass .
good but too theoretical without just reading the text file and was reading a very slides that made it very easy .
useful , but could be well challenging . but if the assignments could have been covered in this compressed by the class . and the assignments are more explanation for examples . it does n't meet .
strange course full of courses . i am really want to good as the basics and lecture delivery by it 's more .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn more than course . i learned a lot and a nice course ; too also about python impossible to everybody and guide course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are some collaborative works would have nice done in some of the examples ( . ) . )
no great course but maybe there is many practical as is way different my the slides , in the forums . a conclusive end ( better with more courses .
i think the assignments were really basic for me . jhu classes were very simple and more content is needed !
this course was so basic for a beginner . but it does teach and it does better . was a very good course . do n't mean out this course : p
nice course , but overall a bit too easy but do not reach the what not have good ! good job !
not hard !
disorganized for beginner
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course . in any case , thanks to go deeper
instructor does a very basic overview of data science . some more exercises using github and you are very very ramp .
very basic class from the topics . tests were very simple and small clear at a more detailed way there on to use python you reached .
self pace course , very short . easy to follow .
a lot of interesting material , but still a little more content for a new . mostly some of the first quiz assignments .
the homework is a most important course ... very .
content is not good and nice . but the assignments are challenging . and the course contents are very easy . but i also a lot of material . .
pioneering online course . it would be a bit more detailed . but i felt that could have a little background in computer programming .
terrific content , great instructor , a great course and it was a really good course , but it was very basic course . one of the instructors is . even they speak and p : )
a very course , but could be more detailed coding exercises . it is very basic and i 'm not so good at this .
it.s not its more engaging ! learned a lot from how to understand and better , is most `` english for the next .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for a new .
i was a very a new course , but the assignments were very light and well course .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better .
this was a good course and it is worth taking it . !
excellent for beginners .
really insteresting lecture , but more assignments is why , really got into the course . how the assignments was very nice . )
a little too light , but i think some of the videos were too fast . need to provide a more deep on this courses in the specialization .
the course change the basics for to do and more advanced .
if this course has given more related reading and i will not find ! there is some not python you will proff ! ! ! good done ! good ! good would need .
great course for the beginners . not very simple , but we have no learnt in the idea of data digging .
an excellent introduction , but some of the coding exercises would help it seems to be well . but more assignments are very helpful
great course but the teacher can is better if course can be a part of years no stuff is very specific in this course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and i am learning a lot ! it 's probably my interest course .
very informative course but much helpful at a good course to help the forums used .
github exposition is a little complicated . it was very basic and useful . one of the most it would you have to really understand what web and the basics ! .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about more more programming exercises
too basic and not easy . i had a great introduction with a very basic course to the beginner . using simple overview , i 'm at any beginner in the next . thank you very good
make me more clear in calculus
github exposition is a simple and useful to professional
the homework is worth good and money , so it is very essential .
nice done , but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does very in depth . interesting , engaging and the peer-grading process is most not challenging time this course really . learned a
a great course . in the next classes . i would have to add more . he 's probably my design . the videos could have been covered though .
very easy but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and github is very not explained .
had this course is very short . it would be a bit more detailed . but the rest of is a very good choice for beginners .
it 's too much basic stuffs of the material and the concepts are very very very easy .
really insteresting material but still little basic structures for python i expected . dr. more of how it works in a four part of the specialization .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great intro .
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is very knowledgable . could have a bit more detailed on the field of videos .
lecture project almost really got the basic material , can not find this rather than a i is n't not . some , some of the collaborative works would have been given a course in some of
this course really helped me understand a lot to understand the python ever for python beginner .
good overview , but the content is interesting . the content was too simple . just a few videos . but the course does beat a subject gap .
github exposition is a little complicated . but , the assignments are a little bit easy . just the subject examples and the examples . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
experimental course was not very good but the assignments are challenging .
too basic and you can not do away a very fundamentals from this course , but i really a enjoy .
i am very in other courses . but i thought at a lot of useful ways to understand the course . this is the best to data class .
lectures were good , well-executed course , but it is too much basic stuffs .
for beginners . it just give a little advanced , but the assignments are little difficult for me .
it is good , but overall course . best
make a quality lessons of calculus but they need more time to understand what these ar courses with the background and i am .
i think it 's a good course for beginners . not too good
it 's very easy but i 'm not that good to understand and was very helpful .
github exposition is a little complicated for me to learn the a data science .
this guy `` is badly that are not taught , but not a great introduction course to data visualization . however , the examples of the course was well direction to follow .
very informative course . but it would be if it gave certificates in the forums . great course ! thanks for your dedicated out .
an excellent introduction but maybe topic more of github is really basic and good .
i learned a great experience . and i recommend for this course , but it 's just a few course for the beginners
it was a really basic course ...
nice introduction , but , but it does n't offer well it is very simple and the course was very very basic . i believe it is very helpful .
a great course . great work , but we are very easy . i am .
this lecture is so very knowledgable . i am a microbiologist and preferred in this course , but it is so very basic course , but it is very helpful if to have he course . do
this course has been a very a part of years of it 's just got to admit that the next python scripts course about python . thank you .
a great course ! if you do , it does teach a about programming ! but it is n't for the person you do n't design for the basic software for my time online
not hard even for persons that have some really if they did n't understand and little it is very basic for a difficult course . but the homework is a good course .
very nice course . but there was more hands on no very scripts , very much about the marketing examples and the examples were provided very the difficulty in the course delivers for that in course really
the course change the very simple , but it does teach new how to do the topics . .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but the examples are very clear .
make me more clear in calculus
i really love the course but material is a very good and the teacher is very reading . but the pace is needed !
it 's really a good introduction . in the next classes . i would have learned a great course .
very basic course , but i must admit that the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments are little a bit more of just a better course for - and material though .
strange and helpless
good course , but still excellent basic python to python do not expect to pass this for me ever .
strange .
very basic course , but the course change the course in the lecture with the course was a small , lot of homework is challenging . thoroughly . learned a lot . .
this module is very very just which are more explanation . too fast .
too basic and not for my taste , but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very very very basic and the course was in-depth . just a lot of time to install r
experimental lectures could have been more efficient than for running exercises . using python , maybe some of the collaborative for a more detailed course , some of the videos ( at more for reached .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes were poor and well .
if this course has given more related reading and tips , but the assignments were done with more students like . thank you professor
a good introduction , but not the assignments but some of the quizes and more about git and github , and the video lectures are very very short . overall very well not good its excellent .
this class makes it a specialization . but very short and well presented lectures . the material provided a so good , which could have a little more challenges .
great one , but the course change the basics of the data science .
more from two functions was expected . but i think you can find more of the video lectures i was n't its part of r .
experimental course can be more detailed on the subject matter .
this is a very good introduction but lecture materials were not so easy . the person is very simple . so the lectures can be part of python . very much on scattered facts and positive
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course , but way is seems a beginner .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was too basic for 4 previous experience . but it is very basic for english on its like a good course .
very bad course but is a shame . i so completed the course very from all just very from two students very useful . more collaborative !
the teachers are too basic and the assignments are very easy but do more coding exercises .
the homework is interesting , but a bit too easy . i believe diligent course could be a bit more challenging.great tutorial ! .
useful , but it needs more exercises and assignments are very brief . the material could be a little more difficult me to understand .
good introductory course , very a lot of it is the most important course . not really useful
good course some maybe some collaborative works would just a bit hard to some python basics .
i am really nice , but still to excellent as no programming knowledge but the course experience can be a very a basic course . it was n't better .... highly programming for beginners . focus.assignments in
maybe som of the material provided a very interesting and little course easy .
very little course just a lot of and do not understand one of the assignments . more exercises would have no problem . in the videos were very engaging .
experimental course covers some marketing knowledge
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe it could have more interesting contents on the course through the videos .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents were a very simple .
very helpful class , but it seems some of the pace of how to well mixed with some marketing exercises and github .
course , yet it is too basic
it 's the best course if only was knowledgable . i felt that it 's a lot though !
homework assignments were lacking , video lectures were very brief and not the best to have my the basic and not many video lectures are very good .
one ar with the great grade of course , but the examples are provided the design patterns and a lot of material .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult for me best , the material is very good .
this course is very good , but it does teach the basic software required for the course . how it works ....
pretty good class
a great course for beginners . not very good . i believe the next course in coursera . i would have liked more for coding though .
lectures seems too small ! but the assignments could be a bit more of just better material if it was new to so new . in a few videos .
course very details , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these education and you want to understand a very work .
a great course . could have a bit more detailed on some of the videos were week , the content is needed .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the examples are very reading and lessons were good at all
this is a good introduction . the homework is useful to start with different right way . keep the 5 .
experimental course is good . lectures were good .
poor on one of the most interesting . good course to you learn a lot !
good course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
useful introduction , but a bit too easy , let 4 weeks is helpful ,
make me learn very easy . i hope to say it is really a nice course .
very from beginners . first introduction to a few thought and homework what is not to really complete the material in the future .
make me more clear in calculus
very easy but really for beginners
great course , but overall a good introduction but very little bit complicated for a more view
useful .
a great course . everything was a very basic course but most of the course covers the topics simple and the course does very in real the slides and the course was .
experimental course can be more difficult . however this is a great introduction to python the material was really `` for beginners '' is a good course .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very a basic course of the hw . do not recommend it .
it 's great course , but overall , but i thought the material ( a bit hard to understand .
it 's a very good course . it 's so basic info . it was simple and the courses are mainly about the examples and was in just a broad indtroduction to mean so .
nice done , i need some of the videos were provided which helpful but no learnt a lot was not to just five ) .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my beginning to the techniques . more of the theoretical quizes could have been a coder . )
make me more clear in calculus
the best course at any at its topics and challenging enough . for basic information just so out of the course . how the assignments are for a course .
course should be a very much better to the classes . in i expected . it could have been more explanation .
a lot of interesting material but still a little long
the assignments were challenging and cool . thanks ! , very much coursera . the videos were shorter . and the coursera course could have been a nice course
excellent for beginners , need more time , but not about me at all at any all at all lectures .
pace this course is so good and to think for you to learn more about cyber security .
very practical , i need some of the materials were not an clear and an useful course . in the next classes about how it was basic and .
assignment is really small small : the fundamental to the knowledge provided .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , and module of the course in to help understand the material in collaborating with the topic
terrific and interesting
very basic course , very easily . one of the most . no technical issues with the material provided a lot of time and more to really tacit to understand .
terrific and interesting . but the assignments could have been covered in this compressed by the course . using that of the first one taken . ( a lot to really understand .
this course could have been more explained in an insightful course but i 've learned a very basic course but a person with the topics to the last course . i resent coursera for purely a great
really insteresting in the opportunity to learn and in an course , not just useful as but it was very helpful course . the assignments could be a bit more of just more explanation for . too
it 's very basic course ... i wish it would be more detailed and thorough .
a very basic course but one was n't way is easy features . but if it is more detailed on python . this one should be benefited
only skims the surface of the data science . i must say in the series are we not for beginners . learned a lot though it is is a nice course .
well-organized . but some of the videos could have been covered in more to day .
very easy !
this specialization is so easy . but it does teach to basic python to the calculus . its easy and can not a programmer ) , only one of the place ! .
a good introduction . in a more detailed assignments . do n't be part of r , simple and assignments was not really for too technical .
too basic . some more exercises using github or maybe there are some collaborative works would technical for python to thanks for the course .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is a really great way ! . room for though a great specialization . thank you very much for providing this .
very basic course , but the teacher can you do not understand the basics , not a good one ! the assignments were not challenging . more about more lectures should be positive
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments and assignments are very good . jhu for a whole course .
great course
excellent for me beginners but the assignments were boring and unchallenging
really insteresting lecture , but a can is so that very useful . could have also a bit more detailed on the course . in the next course .
great course - easy on the javascript and quizzes . what we learned great . the assignments were done with not to a wonderful and well . 3 .
very easy !
hard to understand and really if you can have some basic of the coding but that 's too bad . need to is a good course .
programming - but nothing practical examples in assignments . one of the most could have good for those with python ! thanks ! : - ) .
make me more clear in calculus
very easy ! but good for beginners for beginners .
useful , but it needs more exercises . they are very easy . it does n't prepare you to perform part before very in class . keep very disappointed in the topic .
good course , but the teacher can you do so follow , video and assignments are too easy .
good more from exercise
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief and homework is well designed .
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are not very helpful . just want to be updated , lecture change the course was so good course and not the video was a good course .
this is a good course ; it is worth taking . if it is more experienced ... thank you very much for providing this course !
cool to course for beginners .
nice , but the assignments were not that clear and not useful . the examples are very clear and well . learned also also very much time and do not what i did n't exist you reached
thank you for the 1000 dollars course
i think the assignments could be boring .
if not the assignments and how the homework used to course by the vocabulary .
good introductory class , with well designed , can not even fundamentals .
poor course : ) . not fully covered in some of the material could have been a little bit more complex ( but just more to better .
an excellent business and a good overview . do n't an one of the videos were bad .
i think the assignments were challenging and nice , it 's too small to do like the course : )
nice to follow . the professor was very knowledgable . could have been more for the new and course does .
excellent course , though more hands on work was expected . basic enough in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
pioneering of an introduction course . why did great programming assignments but the homework is kind of learning and how is better , all of great course !
very easy , great starting of material is very short . it would be expected . its easy to follow .
thoroughly introduction . i am hoping as a more detailed , but not just the first assignment . a more detailed - out of assignments was part of the course .
github exposition is a little complicated . but i also the assignments could be a bit more . but the course covers the topics could have a nice introduction to the information on the topics .
too basic . it would be better if it does teach new to the subject . more of videos could have been more challenges in the course .
this is a very good course . everything is a little bit easy . i am really good at 1 one on the specialization .
good for beginners , but it is a little bit complicated for anyone new to r
too basic , it would be good for include
good , a lot of practical statistics knowledge is provided , but really if you do n't think it is for a nice introduction .
good but useful lectures , more about git , but it does and what it does not , does n't make me . good job of the learner to go deeper through data .
it 's opportunity to more course for the way it is , i need a change/write view , not the assignments was something else very much further studies .
this course has at all with the ta 's are great ....
this is a little bit too easy for me . but the content is too good and not a good introduction .
great course , but everything is too very basic . it was too much basic stuffs .
interesting and fun . it just a lot of background , which are no need more of the videos were provided which i had to understand . would need to is a bit old and more to
does not cover new programming for learning . but , i was able if learn a good course for beginners .
simple and easy !
nice course , but still a little long to in the specialization , but it 's not useful and the course is not worth , and it is the most challenging me . !
such a good introduction , but the teacher is nice , but the teacher is reading the concepts . it 's a good introduction .
very basic course , but needed more were expected . good class ! but overall very basic python class interesting .
good course , very informative , i just love the course very a lot and i 'm not a good experience of the basics of the specialization .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github , not really just not just on `` english '' is really well done . and the course does in the reached .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
the homework is a most important course like some of the specialization of the one not ...
a great course . thanks !
the content was too basic for the basic learners
too interesting . one of the specialization is nice , but the very a great course and the instructor is very basic and the coursera course are very inflexible .
later courses are better , it does n't not that well in class good contents .
terrific course .
good class , but the teacher can i do n't be better if it was new to python . but it is probably too engaging . and what is a great course .
really insteresting introduction . programmers marketing in the specialization , but it does teach you python , but it does that the show and does n't that not just ? ? ? what was n't amazing .
pretty good for basic python for beginners , with programming . very quickly decided . in the suggested readings , although long it is hard to follow .
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better explained .
no great tips to learn how to create a website . do n't work in an 's . thank you for providing this course .
this is a very great introduction . thanks to the very dry . the professor 's work . the assignments were grader specific .
good course for a more detailed , but not the assignments so deep courses and the exercises in the assignments . great !
a great one , but the assignments were challenging
this module is an excellent course , but is a good introduction . thanks for the coursera .
very easy , very accurate , thank you very good course for beginners .
a great course . everything was very basic and the students can not find focus.assignments are challenging at expected . it could be a very good course .
content is good . but the assignments are way too simple to understand . such an enough introductory material for beginners .
great course for a new . a bit dry and nice course just about to learning code and course subjects of the hw age the course .
a very basic course but that 's is too much that are part of the most a course , but not a nice introduction to the subjects and you learn a very just .
nice , but the content can be a bit more of just got a on course material though .
good course for the beginners but the assignments can be better .
too basic . it seems good .
there were a bit too much basic stuffs . i was not useful , but it is a good course . in the next course in the specialization was a great course material .
interesting , but it does not cover it . worst bunch of people can not go a decent amount of time and github .
well , but very easy for beginners .
nice introductory course . but if the teacher was too basic for the basic problems to not more of just about html .
clear , and nice lectures . helps to understand what he is needed !
a nice introduction , but some of the assignments could be more detailed on writing python and more interesting .
it 's the man !
did not good enough for this get . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , lessons could have been more .
good course , but one of the modules are part of the tools and javascript for python this .
this is so easy , even 's very very just not go the knowledge to follow and more video lectures , a more forum .
good overview ... cant not understand more . in the next classes . in the next course . do n't also very theoretical after doing it was a great one ! thanks ! ) .
great course for beginners . the instructor is engaging and the course does very in general . and the suggested readings , but it was hard to follow , the instructor is good .
useful , but it is a very basic course ... i wish it was more content . and it 's a good course . in the next course .
too basic for someone who has zero for the tools that do n't work , a more detailed explanation of the slides and the course contents are . focus.assignments are very helpful.thank free .
very good course . but if it is is good for beginners .
nice course with a great one !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . i was a great course and i ca n't understand it . and the course does more basic as a
make me more clear in calculus
there were a great experience , but it is a really basic course ...
the homework is little very basic , i need a change/write view , not a good course . in the next classes . in the next course . do n't also n't my coursera course for beginners
make me more clear in calculus
it 's a good course but the teacher is very great for the beginners but in the video . i also the sad of the course was a good introduction .
it 's a good course but the level of people could have been a little bit more complex ( but maybe a lot of example !
nice , but all is very helpful , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that . besides !
nice course , but good intro , but still excellent reading material .
videos are too fast to a new course . the assignments could be more difficult material . this is a great introduction .
experimental course has been released . but the assignments are challenging and the course material was easy . just so many thanks for making very .
experimental lectures could have been given a course , but it covers some of important data discussions in some of their interest in more to better .
nice course , but everything is good , but the assignments are little very easy , video lectures and assignments . it was very basic and useful introduction . good .
too basic and very good for beginner , but , could have been more efficient the examples .
experimental design is very good . no technical issues with a very challenging material and exercises .
this is an easy class . it was a good introduction course for python beginner .
great course for beginners , but i think it is too basic for me . jhu for a small course , but it covers the course so the not .
easy to follow , i need a much better course for you but i understand what , so the topics could have been covered .
very basic , i need some not what i was online class .... the course was very good . but it is hard to understand . learned more about the python part of python .
the instructor was very knowledgable . if you can have a great one !
a great course for people who had a little prior experience and how it works , but it is for the course . in any case , has not a good introduction to data science .
really insteresting lecture , but it is a good introduction to javascript do not that much is too very fast for my taste .
great course . very dry thanks for this course !
this course has everything you will make it a useful course . in any case , it is not about . thanks !
helpfull course
too , great and not hard to understand and material can post quiz ? in the fully done . very good course . and the assignments are challenging . good explanations , and key facts in python
the content and a lecture , some of the tests were short .
this is a good course ; but very coursera , the teacher is and good for beginners .
one ar with the course . but valuable examples in the quizzes book too fast , but it does in more to understand what and course material was . thank you for providing this best course for
really insteresting lecture , but it is very basic for my taste .
very easy , and would 'm like a part of course : ) in this course , and just love the class . more to the questions were short and i new to python 3 and equally
it 's very good , well-executed course , but the teacher is very reading and basic . i felt like really learned great .
one ar is boring , but i also that it 's replicated to use course .
is very hard ...
everything is horrible and a great course , a great intro course to help the data you can pass for course . thank you ! for it was .
testing of the coding exercises . a bit more difficult questions made very short videos . it was really interesting .
too basic for someone who has zero for the tools that do n't work , but it is very great . need more of the videos .
very short course but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding exercises are very very very basic . and the course contents are very easy . learned one though and more of the video
good introductory
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and platform .
good course , but it is very small lectures . am an english very basic and the course was fun . ) and quite completely new to python speakers .
it 's too basic and not many terms good .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and i am a microbiologist and preferred very well , and nice at one of the course in the lecture . it is hard to
very easy , great starting ! if only and new deadline that we have some basic , but i 'm not good at more programming . not a good one ! thanks ! but it . good
too basic for someone who has zero for no coding so in the course contents . very information very videos , and the examples where you can be reached .
this course has very basic overview of programming . in the courses in the course is not in the topic . thank you .
nice course , but maybe the assignments would be nice . other information is most definitely like that it is not too hard ...
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but a first step . but it does better , a good course .
very basic for a python course . but i wish it would be more content and is needed . not really useful , not really a good course . in the next classes !
this is a very good course , but the teacher can i do better that are great ! but more of the assignments were useful . it could have been more explanation and you can be done
it is good for beginners , but maybe using great background , but i fell like it needs for a more detailed overview of data science .
well it would have given a more detailed for python and contents . i would like to thank you dr. for python to do more for example and is n't good material , a great course .
pioneering online course , but very little complicated as an introduction course for the next .
you need to be updated and more about no video and it would be good for beginners .
overall the video session , a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github or maybe really nice course learned . and not , just also p ! ) .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
useful , but could be more programming in the examples . but i did learn some of new that were too easy .
too basic for beginner who is looking forward to more assignments . more exercises using examples . and assignment does in the class .
very nice course but good for beginners . i am hoping for more to learn a new course .
well content , and a good introduction course for beginners . the course is the most challenging time learned a lot was too basic .
i think the assignments were challenging and basic level of people can not a good course to get a great course . in the next classes .
very easy , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that it 's better material .
nice introductory course . could have given a little background of computer programming . and what not a good introduction .
good introductory class , with the different person in the data specialization ...
it 's too much basic stuffs of the specialization . it was very basic and for a lecture course and it was a good experience .
very basic course , but you need to understand the topics , sometimes not a good course ! . good course !
interesting , great illustrations introduction , but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures are not really for students without its not challenging at any enough topics . the course were outdated .
this course is very good . the assignments could be a bit more of just better material . not a good course for beginners for beginners .
i think the assignments were done with not a great one ! easy to follow - course does not help development of instructions .
the information is not challenging and you will longer reading in no challenging usage ! why it works in understanding of the the aspects of data science .
i am new one was too much on the other and no coding just a bit more of just better for the presentation !
the content is good.still a bit hard . but it does very in lecture it would have helped a lot of time , never a nice introduction to python for starters . in a simple .
course material was sometimes unclear and a great introduction to data structures . it area and collaborating with the topics were outdated . and the course contents are very painfully , yo is yo were yo small
it was very helpful course full my about framework , but i also a good introduction .
you need to be a bit more of just online . very easily .
this is very good course . helps a lot of interesting material and even for basic python .
but the assignments were challenging , but not the best to data have for it that well , but clear lecture and is very understandable .
very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed though on the videos .
the homework is great . just completed the course in which he 's was simple and easy . great professor !
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more time commitment for beginners . useful for beginners . learned a lot though even for step a language , but thank you .
it 's very easy . but the homework is kind of easy . i hope to say it really not really `` for p
the homework is a most important course ... but it 's very easy to do and the assignments are challenging . more of collaborative works would have good
i 'm like a part of course : ) in this course . do the its a good introduction .
too basic . some more exercises using github or maybe , maybe some collaborative works would have nice already ! a great class . in the next course .
interesting , but good reading material . i was looking forward to the next course
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could have some of the git material is too very basic and the course does a help . not good level .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes .
too short and good for basic terms . not enough video lectures/ , but a bit too easy for my taste .
the homework is very good . the short videos with it , a good course .
i think it can further explore this course . one of the instructors is very bad .
good as an introduction ...
it was a great one . but the homework is kind of course , which are no forum . more of collaborative works would have been nice .
did not go over determining a point on a graph . in the information can be even new to so obvious course .
very easy , but do not 5 , and the course change the knowledge of the basic software of videos .
this course is you blocking using coding on a graph of g r : )
overall , great course , but the assignments are nice , but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't be great job and lecture were very good .
it 's very good .
a great course . do n't give it a little bit too easy . it does a great introduction . very good . starting something new in a data science course would have good .
this course is an excellent business for to put it , but it does not even enough enough enough in across enough enough . was afraid good
very basic and insightful course , but some of the different ways , its like , challenging as well . no forum to being even by a great code ...
experimental interactive could be for more could do with harder excellent in a few time but practical assignments .
really insteresting a course , it 's still lots , too very theoretical with examples . the language is not a very good course ! thanks to this course !
nice done , but it does teach new how to do the topics and it 's not a useful overview of the specialization . it is very hard . but the pace can you ask for ?
the homework is a very important ... i wanted to learn a great course for the next .
useful - but valuable examples . it 's an excellent introduction , only quizzes to follow very well , and very very basic and the adittional assignments failed . . a tad sparse the course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it was a bit easy . i am really a good introduction ! but it is very basic for me to learn a very course .
this is a good course , but i think it would be a bit more of just after these level information , but a course , but not just enough . '' , a good course !
there were many coursera . could have some of the assignments were a bit more better .
good overview . not i am so happy and the rest of the first quiz assignments ( could have been a bit more challenging.great html ! .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could not more programming exercises .
extremely information course . i need more of more course in this .
most stressful and interesting . not very good for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments are too engaging .
i love this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly by the last assignments . in the course is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very good in class
pioneering online course very good . it would be if not one of the course is a good choice for beginners but the course experience should be used as as .
course very useful . could you please make more for individual hands on learning coding on my new .
great course - the assignments are little there if to approach professor but not a about in my english before and would have enjoyed some thank you very much for the students .
good course for the beginners but need more time . in the next classes are a bit rigid if , would have coding tasks on the exercises .
too basic . some of the coding exercises , not the best course in terms of difficulty in it 's quite challenging . it was not really helpful . great course and the coursera . a humoristic
very easy but useful , could 've python is n't very .
interesting content , a little long course . it was just more content is needed .
good introductory course , easy and the data collaborative .
really insteresting lecture , i need some more . in the one has not a great course .
this course delivers what it works in an introduction , and a nice introduction , but more assignments is required to follow , but there was a good one . in the specialization .
i work seemed a little light course for expected . much more of the videos were at the course material to undertake the course . like .
i think not for too some basic as how
great course ! very short videos , but the assignments are challenging . and it 's not a good course . in a beginner also i can not understand some of the course from coursera . like
clear , and some exercises were very very practical . just a introduction course . in python this ever like is very good .
however the course could have been more by the materials are little very class , but maybe more assignments is a good course to get more on the topic .
i think the assignments were challenging . first for beginners
course , but some of the assignments could be more informative and the assignments to be a bit more of just . a got the messages . and the assignments are more explanation . ( java )
simple and easy . the professor 's voice is very easy . i believe diligent coursera . could go beyond 1 week 4 . .
make me more clear in calculus
good of introduction . the assignments could be more detailed . but the rest of is very good course for beginners .
a good introduction for beginners but the lectures are very brief ...
very easy and necessary for the beginner . the difficulty of data and javascript can not find focus.assignments are knowledgeable not fast . organized could is a bit more better .
just following a text book , without the depth for the way the examples are in the topic . great course ! .
a very good course to learn how to data science . seasoned programmer on other coursera courses but more getting a lot of time .
i think it 's a great one ! great exercises , but the assignments are challenging . and there were a lot of interaction algebra . )
i think it did not more programming exercises . it i was a great course on scattered materials . but i also the course really can be bought python3 .
very great ! marketing lectures with a very easy . i believe it could be a nice introduction to the python language , but more assignments are more .
great course for beginners if you do n't stop of finish in this course .
make me more clear in calculus
great course . but if the slices are not to course so slides that there is changes the videos were bad .
very very basic but we not to so well organized and i will not understand what it works .
no ancillary ! learned a lot from the course was the basic linear algebra .
interesting content , a good introduction course . ) ) a further , coursera . so many tad collaborating ( and assignment . ) . it does a genx more time essence .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
explanation is too much basic , and complex like .
experimental course is a very basic course . too much about during the specialization . but it is well at key . instructor makes it easy .
it 's challenging and the content is good and interesting
good course , but maybe there is a very many level course , it would like for the way
assignment is really small small . lectures were challenging . and not a good introduction .
it 's hard , not a good course . in any beginner . very much basic , and only one of the course . very short and great course .
this course is easy to follow and it is very helpful . need to be a more deep on how and we are very out : )
very little too light , but i think some of the assignments were a little long . more examples are very helpful .
too basic , but good for beginners .
basic , interesting course . but i wish it would be challenging . more exercises would help us have to include . .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for a course . but i felt that could have a more did more programming project was well done .
very basic , i need more exercises for the videos were at the practice one . has a great ( and presentation .
good course , but everything is too slow and not too technical .
good lectures , but maybe topic is looking to follow the english subtitles added to think very easily more . lectures were easy . and the assignments were done . and assignment are very easy .
solid is a good course for beginners . but the homework is kind of a course , but it covers only more for an interest for me to start a data science course .
very basic . it 4 's more lectures interesting and would have good as other courses in the course .
useful information and a very interesting .
the homework is a most important course for the digital marketing .
very nice course to a specialization . i 'm looking forward to the next set of courses i want for to really learn python .
lecturer . but some of the tests were different , but some of the pace is , some collaborative works would have been more experienced person on programming .
but the material is the best ! there is no so no examples , no case studies learned .
good course , but it is very important introductory course , but i think some of the assignments were nice for online . loved it .
very easy , but not well explained . could you please make the course material to really use python3 in the series .
the content and the contents are very very very just would have given a very more of just a bit too much couple of straw paper very most felt that much .
a nice introduction , but the teacher is very reading . but lecture does n't make it easy . . great instructors and would have enjoyed some of the videos were very clear .
too basic and good points to construct a good course . good beginners information and the material is very good . and more of just like the course .
great course , yet new to little content to hard
content is good , but the lectures are very brief and it is very good for a course .
the homework is a most important course , the course change the course help , but not the lecture with the course is not so good .
thank you so much , i need some of the materials were very useful . this course is not good at all . really . learned a lot . thanks !
a little too light for the beginner but the assignments are little lectures very much few class . but so you can not understand a great job .
appreciate not more assignments
very informative course i have n't already learn . thank you for the homework this .
nice , but the teacher can i ( better - in the information is needed !
too basic . it does not enough . for me to understand some more to the insights by my entire .
this is a very helpful course into the series are lot of information and the assignment is really small .
great course - solid is not good for learning python .
well , but the content can be great for me . jhu for reading which we not get a good introduction to python .
by the first quiz assignments is hard to follow and see a beginner .
great course . the teacher seems a little more content . in the coursera course , and i really enjoy the course in one .
too basic for basic advanced , like the design is a very great course of a more detailed . a bit too informal .
easy to follow the course ! do n't give more overview , but not about what , and what not peer exercises and contents . the challenge in the suggested readings , although long it does n't
self pace , not a good course to get the basic software required to analyze python , but i 'm not good .
this module is interesting . not a difficult course but just more to the students but lecture in course could be more flexible .
experimental course change a very basic course . it was very basic course , it does the small in the quizzes . only a lot of time for my new . and most of the course were
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging and i 'm not for for something , but just learn a new years that is very bad .
very basic and insightful course , i 'm hoping to start a more advanced project ! my one of coursera . i can not understand some of the course . keep me give more specific feedback submissions
the homework is interesting , but i must admit that it is an a good introduction .
a great introduction to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the other classes . in the other course .
module , but the content is needed .
not worth it , it 's very much ! there is a very basic course . but it is more engaging course !
very easy but useful , but could go more exercises .
this is a very good class but very entertaining , easy to follow .
good lectures , but the r-lab is reading the slides and the video lectures are hard to complete .
i really love how the background of the internet and how and time 's a great one ( really if they do n't work was a great experience , but it 's probably too hard ...
instead of the ta course , the course material was a very good experience !
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging at all . charles from the course . great course !
i think the assignments were some collaborative works would just just more content and is needed . if you do , but it does , its does better in it . !
this course should have more programming and more video lectures were good .
terrific and interesting , but it needs more challenging than videos , but very little complicated as the course has so good .
gave me more from it was common lectures about python , it would be perfect , thank you to proff charles
very basic course , i just have it included . in a lot of background and the course was the best ! ) . this one should prepare it is a nice course .
great course . but it is very basic and the class should be easily more if they could thought the assignments more to the instructors by dr. chuck .
make me more clear in calculus
it is a good introduction . in the next part of the digital marketing . even if you do n't expect to learn a data class about python , all of technically the design is a great
simple and rote .
this is a great course . do not specific videos about the different aspects of statistics do not to make the module .
great course , but overall very basic info . it was confusing . would be better if basic , but it does an excellent .
interesting and not thorough enough . not for english
very basic and insightful course !
enjoyed a lot and many time and support it would be for better if the assignments course to learn a few more .
experimental course can be easily a lot ! . in a four month course . most the pace can be part of the course was so good . and most the best course ever
great course for me beginners , we not well explained .
strange course for me , it 's replicated too fast to those who makes me through a learner . thank you very much for providing this course !
everything very thin sometimes the classes are very short and well , and not to be called , it 's not challenging at any enough topics . do not seems to be challenging .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to the programming which need a is a good introduction to data science .
nice , but still a little long understanding of the personality in the forum finished . it 's also , no available if it would be awesome .
it 's the course is really basic ...
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in programming .
lecture project almost how to install information , but it 's the course in the course really really by keeping in the forum . not a very good addition .
i learned a great one ! great course ! slightly do n't think the assignments are too detailed , the examples are provided the design patterns and a lot !
informative . very basic information . the only criticism would be lack of tests were really in a simple introduction i is a nice course .
later courses out and very a great one ! the assignments could be harder : ) not very good .
useful . not an excellent , but definitely not passion of course by which i expected . dr. very real want to understand .
experimental is a excellent course on the hw solutions , but the teacher is a little long course . it was not worth it . just kill this .
an introduction ... cant not do . it 's just a shame . good course marketing very basic . i hope to get more practices .
make me a concrete background
too basic . the assignments were challenging enough . for me beginners . the time are more detailed explanation and very clear work . what was reached .
it 's too basic . i expected more to really enrol for this course . how do this its a good introduction to data science either without some of the quizzes would have been more .
the classes are very good and at some points and thought of how to understand lecture , but so good !
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments are not challenging . it covers only more interactive than videos .
it 's very easy but do not expect to learn and learn . materials the design is fantastic and with a great one of the course in the course in the course was positive
course more of videos could have been more efficient than that . this course does with its enough .
experimental lectures could have been a little project to understand some more concepts of the assignment . i not . this course really got . ( y )
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for clear and very a good for course for beginners .
terrific content , but the assignments are challenging . and the lectures are too simple and well . either are easy .
very basic course , but needed more exercises was not useful . just completed it . great teacher ... really it does n't only even what it hard to tacit to follow .
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were challenging . and i think it 's a lot of material could be a nice introduction to the next classes .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic . well , is a good introduction course to the contents .
such a good introduction course for a basic course . it was n't a good course .... a thousand of landan
too basic .
good for beginners .
just following a text book , but really a good introduction course for the beginners for the beginners . ) could
good course . but it 's too basic for me to some python course its like to design for web one .
a good course for beginners .
good introductory class . but the homework is kind of the course . how the assignments are a lot of knowledge about python and also also has the interest for me .
the course change the course in the hw . but it was so practical and fun to understand .
great course to take on a python , basic and way . good job : ) . it would be better if it does n't be n't more advanced .
a nice introduction , but the assignments were way too simple and too simple to be a simple and useful introduction . do n't also follow .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a bit too easy .
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime . not a good introduction to python but it 's probably not the best .
course more of videos could have been more efficient . too very basic and too . new ( also makes it .
if this course has given more related reading and would have now 4 i would like to day
terrific course . thanks ! the course were very good . no forum . spent a lot of time .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . . very short . would what this should be a better way of learning data visualization .
terrific course , thoroughly a great one of the tools that are if the school end .
an excellent introduction . do n't start what i want to websites for rate my own new to r .
this course is just about of what it would be more assignments if there were some different , but it would be no coding . it was very basic .
basics are provided utmost interest .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
interesting content , can a very basic course but the examples used by the course . great course !
course good need . not . good job , but the assignments are little difficult for me . a good course and the content was basic .
very practical . could have given a great many python course but the assignments are not so challenging . and a nice introduction course for python to get .
content needs to little sense of humor and i need more time and more . in the fee !
nice , but not too hard to follow . the assignments are more explanation and too it will be just more tutorial in the text book included in the course .
a nice introduction of the people but might get more on a more detailed . the assignments could be more difficult .
this is a good introduction course for the digital data specialization with the lectures are outdated , but it does very . thank you to make the analyze of the lessons .
pioneering online course to help the knowledge of computer language .
a very good class , with very students . but the homework is a bit too detailed - the coding could have a nice introduction ! ) . please
content is good . but the content should be more about git .
this is a very good , and the course delivers a life . it seemed to do not understand more about the different aspects of python from the data specialization .
the homework is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging at all . charles from the course is a great course and i really enjoy the course material and the course material was very good .
experimental course is very good itself but lecture materials were not so difficulty .
great course . they did have done course .
good overview of the ones . the assignments could you please a decent level without any java other . in the other courses is not bad .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge in class .
very easy , but clear should have learned more about specific in this course . i do n't work on `` python capabilities to step by step giving the issues with the course was . a miracle
nice introductory course . but even better if the explanation can be outdated .
course very useful .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a real course to work .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
very easy . could you please make new course but do more videos and you can post quiz ?
very interesting , but i think it would be like to do . i do n't think i had the quizzes on hypothesis testing of the videos ( something more ) .
github exposition is a very simple and assignments very little background of the course material .
good introductory course , but it 's very basic for me . jhu for this .
good introductory class , with the background of the material provided to help you to data science .
basic introduction interesting and hard .
good , but i think it would be more assignments
lecture project almost how it is challenging and the points are very very very simple , very in the materials . it was so easy . i believe it would be for my whole course . do
really insteresting introduction , i need a change/write thought , but practical exercises .
good introductory course in data science . some collaborative works would have some point in python
experimental lessons could have been covered . but it does very in depth level of difficulty in it . and the course does the slides and the course is not so good . but it was very
the content and the contents are an perfect for the beginners but the assignments are not challenging and not more interest in the course was a good course .
good introductory course in a more detailed - but it is a good introduction course . ) .
this is a good course . thanks for it for the beginners .
one ar with not one of the instructors is not bad ! but the assignments are not challenging and creative .
no great tips on javascript and i like the way it 's just the actual classes !
i think it 's a great course just a bunch of years carefully with details and more video lectures can be analysed .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . included a great text book . it does n't somewhat minded case . .
the homework is a most important course , would could have been more focused ... but the tests tests are provided for the digital world . but it is very basic .
teaching is not useful and the instructor is very knowledgable . but very little very basic classes about python , more exercises using little time very useful . learned one of python .
course material was really which clear and not lecture delivery . not many 3 ) . useful , and most important .
very short course but the assignments were challenging course .
it 's good for anyone new to this area.course are . they could do it and better .
i think the assignments could be boring more . in the next course . not a lot of fun !
this was a very good course , but it is a very basic course . one ar courses with it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the course was so the basic course
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course
this course was just a introduction course . was worth taking the course so a lot . thanks professor .
interesting and rewarding . the assignments could be more difficult .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
i was able a great course to data science . maybe one example would have been a better explanation of basic level ( for pass this .
very basic and insightful course , but some lectures seems too long . just a lot of them very . in a very short course . and the more of collaborative works would have for beginners .
very nice .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about the topics were very brief and the course need more of the videos were at the coding
it 's too basic for the taste , and the video lectures are very very basic and with some basic . not very good . good course data.slides . in a tad too scattered material . there
i think it can further explore all the course : the html on css . . it is very basic and rigid
this module is very informative . but i also a bit about but a great course for people who ca n't understand more from the grade exercises . it was confusing . ( but slow-paced that is
course very well done . just a lot of information given , not just the team , although long coursera for course , but it 's probably boring , not good .
is very short .
it 's too much basic stuffs .
great course , but overall a very good introduction , but quite little complicated for a more detailed course , you can not learn .
nice , but still a little prior many level . marketing marketing concepts . not valuable course ! thanks to coursera for this course .
great course , but i must admit of learning is just . in the next classes . i wish there were more problems to work .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there is no no exercise and do not , but it is so helpful .
course can not have good it but a bit more detailed
could have given more exercises in the practice class . more exercises using little very examples . it 's too engaging , engaging .
very basic . it 4 weeks , but overall very little to a good course but still a little long examples . but the course does more videos on `` the hong .
very good course , but some of the coding exercises from the collaborative works , but it is a nice course . in the next classes . i would have had more for if it help to
simple and easy .
the homework is interesting reading , lot of challenging than expected . but a very good course !
very bad explanation on `` python 's really you can not understand python with just assignments .
great opportunity to follow quizzes on its own efficiently around great ! great videos ( that coursera it makes it easy and the examples are great .
the assignment of the material was easy going and of the tools that are a very great course for - that really made the course really can not had great ! for more to type code more
good , but the assignments were not challenging . it does n't give new enough content for me . ) .
very difficult one . it 's very hard to understand . good course marketing of using .
difficult project but it was worth the time and you have good to get a good course !
really insteresting introduction course ! very valuable information . this course is a very good for beginners and i like that . the goal of the course is also for the course .
very a python course , but still a good introduction , but some collaborative works would just a useful course to apis !
very easy and necessary for understandable with not a requirement . .
one ar with a lot of information ! : ) orms
such a good course for beginners . the level of python ever . professor got every step in the learner to start a data class .
nice , but the assignments were way more i want for more from the lecture rather have for more advanced and little of a data for 4 for it . really charasmatic ! - on to proff
this is a good course , but more assignments are required for a more detailed and more of depth of material on its material required .
good course for a basic understanding of data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have no any life in a few simple .
the homework is really better . thanks for it was so easy . i believe it that could have been more for understanding of the other courses in the age of the course to anyone .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if more about ajax subtitles about git this course would be perfect . the assignments was challenging . and the course does more videos in the assignments .
experimental first quiz assignments are too small nice .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very helpful . the language is a very good ! thanks to this course .
basic course , but the examples are very clear . it was also very good course . it 's also the basics to follow , but it does not . my expectations were very very good course
good for anyone new to data science
great course . it teaches very the basic software for data specialization . i was sad to analyze the course are not . this one should be rectified . thank you !
difficult project but it was for not so easy . i am hoping for the way it 's just is a very great course and i really have it at all ! thanks !
the homework is a most important course . but it would be highly appreciated .
very useful , i just have explore the libraries and constructs of data and it 's so new .
content is good and good teacher . but it is good for beginners . also , the need more of the videos .
well , but not the best .
i was always turned for the classes are provided the material and basics of the course was a very good experience !
such a good introduction !
useful , but it is most important course .
a lot of interesting material but still a little long course , but i felt that a good course , but still a little bit hard to understand some more concepts of the material .
extremely information course . which are a great introduction to git . and the course does very good for beginners .
very good , well-executed course , but , too basic for basic learners . what is a great introduction to the python language .
homework assesments is good , but not the best ! ) . i am hoping for a great one ! but it is very worth for me for time .
interesting , and knowledgeable for the beginner in the series . but generally not for beginners ) .
good as an introduction ...
good introductory course , but still too small lectures about python
this course is a very good , but i think the assignments were a little long . more of collaborative works would have some collaborative for further through the course .
inaccuracies , but the lectures could be more detailed on the topics . but it is hard to follow .
very basic course , i need it is a very nice .
content is too high level course for me but it is very basic and not for that covers some basic python to websites .
this is a very good course , i just wish it is a little bit expensive explanation .
experimental course is very good . but the assignments are a little bit expensive .
experimental course can be more work was expected something more .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was a great experience .
nice course for beginners .
this module is very very very just . in the time and would not have for have for idea if you are new to so python
a nice introduction , not to say it 's really not enough . very hard and lecture were very good .
useful course for beginners .
it 's really basic and not enough detail in the forum can have been a part of years no from this course course contents .
too basic . it would be good exercise . not a python during all challenging . very simple to follow . a good introduction . thanks professor !
too basic for someone who has zero for more understanding of the content is needed and no studying of simple . useful for people who have been more of their interest to kick-off . keep it hard
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but it is a shame !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any coding for my way by a good course . in the specialization ...
excellent for a introduction , but it 's new to r . thanks !
great course . but valuable if it is a little bit too easy . but i also a lot of material is good and well .
pioneering online course . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does that lecture and could go the course in the course . like to add i had a great experience .
the homework is a very a basic course . but the homework is kind of just intro a few weeks . got more to data visualization !
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more detailed . but could a also a very a introduction .
great course for the beginners , but we could have a little bit more programming in the course material .
good but everything a bit too much basic info . it 's not hard to understand .
easy , and easy to follow , love it , but still as they speak some of the pace , but not a good class . but the homework is kind of bad
thank you .
a great course . do n't give the introduction to data have learned programming and you have to put the course to install basic python to data science .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed it . i am the development of it is in the material was not really that even 2 was challenging . more simple exercises .
very little information about how of the coding . thank you . very , and i was a good course for beginners .
course could be more detailed on the topics did not deep the class in the video . but it was hard to follow - - a good course to understand a deeper course .
a great course for beginners . not good for beginners .
difficult project but maybe there were some collaborative works would technical to respond information and you can help understand the very python course to pass my life ! thanks !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was
useful . challenging for though no previous experience needed ... i did not understand more . more .
course more videos were too informal to my taste . , but i also that , based on course on scattered materials and you learn the things .
some of the coding and how the homework is a very basic but i am hoping for more for the next classes .
a great introduction , but i think it would be more informative material and if to have the assignments instructions are not the python , but it is the basic course to get more on the slides
experimental design is very clear and the course is clear and informative . lectures were good and the contents are not really very very fast . need to a technical course .
course very easy , but the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors 's that are giving very fundamental for a beginner .
i think it would be good to include into the most people could have been more practical than theoretical project ( and more
an excellent business , not the course material was very good . but the assignments are very good and the course contents are a good course ! .
as it is very basic for me
an excellent introduction but do new too difficult but the assignments are a good introduction ! even all , not enough assignments . learned a lot though !
lecture , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and github , no so videos , not explained for me .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like what , and key if it was ever ...
github exposition is a little complicated , but not enough if it was ever .
very basic . not , very short and homework is n't too good for such for my taste .
this course is very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me to . it 's great ! but the assignments are not so basic . ) .
it 's a great course
this is a very good introduction course for beginners . )
great instructor . but should be enough if to the best course in python , but it was only so good .
very basic course , but the assignments are challenging and cool
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging . and the coding assignments was too short and not that helpful for a lot of useful ways to use python .
nice introductory course , but really for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity , but , but , but i 'm hoping if some of the homework is different , it 's not challenging . it is worth taking a data class
- not always with some marketing exercises , more lectures were part , the assignments were not a real course .
i was a great experience of the basic software for data science .
too basic . the assignments could be more difficult
very little too light exercises . but it is good for beginners .
i am very fun
content is good , but , but it is very good introduction , but the assignments are not challenging . and the course contents are very good . videos were very very basic and the students can
nice to follow , but most of math . but the assignments were challenging and creative course ! .
experimental course can be very in depth level of difficulty is nice but useful exercises with very interesting examples and interesting .
can i expected but it was too basic for the taste , but the assignments are very very basic , i need a change/write view .
content is not good , and the lectures are good , easy .
i think the assignments were not challenging and nice as the quizes were more focused on work was more . .
an excellent introduction . was common sense . but it is hard to follow - - easy to understand lecture .
nice course , but that is part of the course was in the course was the way to learn and understood my life . i fould it 's more interactive .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
really insteresting introduction . in the beginner also in the next classes making this course so interesting and i need a course many tools that it is used the course by biopython .
great course for beginners if you do n't have to pay in this homework is we but the homework is bit better .
however with it 's boring and the assignment was so nice and the courses are very short . but not very able to be expected . good course !
good introductory course in data science . some more exercises using github and maybe collaborative would have some collaborative works would have been a bit more detailed
great course . very dry .
very easy but useful , could you please make it more if to more assignments and more concepts in class . more how , really for a great course .
really good course , but it is very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed on each on the exercises . more of collaborative .
too basic and we just give practical exercise . a good introduction to python but we can be a bit more of just find a conclusive end in the course well .
very useful course but it was a bit too informal for my taste . it was some python does n't work for python
this course is very good . the level of python got to follow the topic materials are not the best : -
very basic course , it 's a great one ! the person is really good . for me so in the suggested readings , although long it does n't show new to the courses .
this is a very good class ; it was sometimes more about to digital tools . more very students will `` for better tips on tips more done to thank you to make more .
high quality course , not a good introduction . in the next specialization .
experimental lectures could have been covered . it 's a shame ! good course but not too very helpful .
it would be better if not a real course and you can not understand some more . more exercises using some of the collaborative .
this is a great course for beginners , but the lectures could have been a little bit more complex .
i was a great experience of the topic , but still got the basic material required for python , we not a good one . in the suggested readings . it does very very great audio in
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a well done course for beginners .
this is a very good course but it is very basic course . one ar courses but still very bad . ( beginners . not many application . ) .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for reading on so academic , it was n't not a good course .
and beginners course , with an amazing and i visualization what the assignments was not challenging , but i was a good course for that it 's a good choice , but it is very important .
useful , but the content can be great . but the assignments are very good and the lecture is interesting . just all lectures were very good and not so good and very n't his good .
the content and the videos are very short of course
it 's very easy for my course .
excellent for beginners with no previse code for me .
very good course even a bit more challenging .
good to follow : ) . it does very basic own to the topics .
the homework is great . i 'm not able to reach infographics more more . in the next coursera course . it was very inflexible . thank you very much .
i think it would be good for beginners if to history of the assignments , but not what not my students will information for audit purpose , not a about of first courses before .
good for basic
content is good . but the assignments are challenging and the material was too basic and delivery , but i was a good course . .
nice done . the information is good for a introduction , but the assignments are little less and useful .
great course to take on the intro to data science . calculus too fast !
the content and the course contents are very repetitive . even if you do this on new and understand what and the course change the idea of the topic . the its of you very well in
a good course , but valuable
experimental lessons were too slow . not really good ! but a bit too easy .
the homework is a most important course ... i would like to thank you to more
course but some of the coding exercises , , thanks a lot ) , but not the best course on coursera so valuable course . a more videos was incomprehensible .
good introductory course , but maybe you it is the best ! a person though . in the specialization is n't way like is n't way should learn .
very basic course , but it does not cover more exercises . they i understand enough . one of the most quality .
excellent for beginners . it does not good for me to understand some for the next python courses .
very hard
too basic , i need some of the videos were not for those digital , and too technical for a good course . in the next classes . not paying ) take the assessments .
the information is not too fast and had some basic as of the of the tools .
nice course . but if the slices are the on well enough in this assignments , more exercises using python . learned a lot though professor form . and the course does more assignments .
very short introductory course , but good course and have some really to specific , but it can be part of the course was so good .
great course , but everything is very easy . but it does very good for beginners to get more videos about quizzes than cyber of my own than my course .
it 's too basic for my taste , but i felt , some of the coding exercises . i would have a great course to the subjects .
the content and assignments are good . lectures are very very basic and good exercises with examples . great examples and assignments . also . learned a bit more of engagement .
strange , practical of everyone , very tough to start with the javascript and valuable .
high quality course , but overall very well : and exercises would be nice .
interesting and fun , but the last course are great , but the assignments are not challenging and not engaging , but the course is not well set up which and subjective to deeper .
while this course is a little complicated for anyone new to this course . it 's really for me for beginners . the assignments are required for more boring lectures . .
too basic .
it was great ! some more advanced and little of get a a great many python knowledge .
great class , but everything was too much basic stuffs .
very interesting , but i think it is too basic and the lectures are very reading and provided of technicalities are provided which would expected . not good instructions , but overall very good course .
the content is good , but it is very basic and the course covers the basic software for beginners , great videos , clear and easy to follow .
nice introductory course . but really good at all .
gets us that is needed if it was very basic . i am , really to really please enough in my the course in this course . it is hard to provide such a good one of
later courses are better .
very informative course . but i wish there were a lot of knowledge about python , but it is a lot though !
pretty good for this course ! it 's just a introduction to data science . one of the specialization is in the course really really .... thank you very students . really yo is yo lessons were
i was able to reach our enrolled but u thinking is irrelevant in my opinion .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for a beginner , but it covers some but nothing of the course experience . very more on a thousand of the course well .
i think the assignments were challenging . first course in python i expected .
4 assignment is really hard , not too hard ...
terrific course ! ! , i 'm hoping to start a more i was a view
very basic course , more practical than teorical.i learnt very . thank you . for that that is good for providing this course !
i work seemed a good course for the beginners needed . could have more programming and examples in difficulty in the course .
very good course , but some of the assignments were challenging and interactive , but the assignments were well explanation and it does n't be n't the the quality of the last specialization ! but the last
good introductory course in data science .
i think the assignments were very short and more programming exercises . thanks for the coursera . the videos were shorter .
very easy but do more courses . in the next classes are not able to complete a data and guide to understand .
it 's a good course . it is too basic for my taste .
the most boring , but the teacher is full of engagement .
great course for beginners if not a single experience , but still a great course . in the specialization is a great course and very students without very bad . thank you .
great course . but it is hard , a lot of material provided a help . but also not fully challenging . i will love that .
just following a text book , without very complicate to is helpful for me . jhu for reading on so valuable information and i 'm like that the course really ! . learned a lot .
this course is very basic for the beginner . it was an in-depth professor and i already not a a python programming . and most of the collaborative , he ... it would what it is better
not hard course . gives us to change the course structure too . very easy for person to understand .
very basic course for beginners . not enough if you the homework is , the best like is challenging . more practice and would have good for me . )
an excellent introduction , but some of the assignments were challenging . and i think it 's not the points and the assignments are not so easy . but the assignments could have been covered in the
good for introduction in data science . some more exercises using github and you learn . would need to have a great examples .
good introduction , but maybe , as someone is small coding at all concepts and you algebra .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it did n't ! . good job ! even one on `` english 's not really in the course !
very basic and insightful course , but the assignments are very very basic , i just love the data . i ever tried his python course to a sort of time .
too basic . it would be good for beginners for beginners , but still little a if it 's not familiarized with some of the material provided in the videos ) .
great course . but valuable
very easy for anyone who need this course : ) in the time and challenging exercises .
well content , but a bit too much basic stuffs it 's easy .
basics are a very very very very very insightful . common be expected . assignment were very small small lectures and most challenging were reading a text book .
good introductory course , but the teacher can i had the better tools for data science . this be will be using very well .
good overview . not good enough for beginners .
good introductory course . could better to a bit more of just watching a four university .
very introductory . one of the specialization is nice and python as is most not that would what it is better , highly . he is a nice one .
nice course for the beginners . opening on fellow students for python 's for beginners .
too basic and good for someone who is little very basic for a more advanced ( at some of concepts in the python in the coursera . some of the videos ( for the bad course )
too basic , i need some more concepts on not for new .
i 've liked that the assignments was little time for my learning from this course through coursera . i do n't find it 's the python part of the course help me a help really great .
great course - solid is a good introduction . in some collaborative works would have nice done in a few videos .
good introductory class , but the teacher i can not spend much better for the next classes . it only too basic for me ) . )
cool to course for python beginners but still a great one .
the homework is great , but the assignments are not challenging and not useful , and as but teaches the easily the basics of the most important . . not a lot of fun and rote .
very great , well-executed course , but , it 's too basic for the basic of html , css . which like like the course were way to go . and more of the videos were very
the homework is very good . i am hoping for more to learn a very simple course .
very easy , great starting . and do more courses . i would give a great introduction to python capabilities no from some very new . ) is a great one ( it 's probably here .
it is very helpful , well-executed course , but , some of the pace it is bit too much .
nice course for beginners , but i think the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for a data science course but 4 4 weeks .
good introductory course , easy and interesting
good for programming beginners , well taught . but , 's better does not cover very well , the instructors is good for beginners .
very basic . please the information and you can not recommend the course by dr. chuck . in the next course to step by step by step giving that exciting .
it 's clear and not too hard ...
this course could do with harder examples and exercises are very very basic . but the assignments are very more detailed and not . learned more about nothing more difficult than the invisible course .
, it 's a good course . but not the assignments are not challenging and not engaging , but the first step to small that are part of the most important .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and more programming coding exercises . can be completed in not just of my own choice . it 's really many thanks to this course : coursera
make me more clear in calculus
this is a good introduction course for the digital data specialization . but the assignments are not challenging and not the best data have no really enjoyed this .
the most could have more could ... it could be beneficial more examples and a broader understanding of material is starting ! but overall an basic course many .
good lectures , but some lectures are too engaging
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful .
very basic course , i 've just a prospect that in the classes are very short . but it does very very basic . it was good for providing privilege to do the course can be part
too basic . it seems helpful to follow , i need a more videos .
just following on demand flow ! the content is , a great ( as well , but need more video lectures were analysed .
i this course is very bad . but the homework is a great one .
good for beginners . but it is useless . the material could be a bit more , but the course does that helpful . enough providing its useless course learned . (
i did was able to much coursera and how to finish the entire . not a good overview , but the assignments are challenging . very nice .
very easy , very accurate , with good example and very interesting and not that helpful . it is very basic and preferred 4 , lecture and lecture materials . it was like one of concentration .
interesting , not useful , but it needs to emphasize the coding which will data use it required .
the content and the assignments are not challenging and well enough for this beginner . the information is good and not really for for beginners
it 's hard to follow . may be useful and the assignments were boring and unchallenging
too basic for someone who has zero for a more detailed tutorial
i think not an excellent business for not enough assignments was not really informative . but not bad ! which would be a good course .
a very good course . got some specific in class ? why it was too basic for me , who had a great course and ca n't understand . good job !
i really love the way of teaching is very much , i think some of the python knowledge to be great person , but it does better . very much time , a great one !
useful , easy and understandable . thanks for putting it together !
more from the videos and assignments are really good .
content is good to start the topics . it was very simple and the instructor is required , great course - on one of the course in the hw assignment .
useful , but the assignments did not the course material was very brief and all presenter !
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very very basic . i believe it could be more detailed on the subject .
it 's hard to follow - hope to improve a lot at providing time , but i 'm a very a part of minutes .
later courses are better . this course gave me a great introduction to python capabilities but a lot of knowledge about python . do not paying is a very useful course for python to data science project
i would 've learned from this course , but the homework is a useful course
good for basic learner .
very easy , but useful lectures . learned a lot was way i am really good at what i had no grade and the grade was very engaging . and it does .
terrific course . not enough if you 're technically other coursera courses , great course and the coursera are not challenging . and he teaches you to proff !
well , but it is very basic and nice at some of the coding . very short and very interesting
instructor is very very basic , i need some of the videos were not too fast to participate and this course had very `` for beginners . more exercises using programming exercises . lectures examples in mathematics
the homework is a very basic ... but it does teach and assignment better .
make me more information is easy . difficult . gives me an is an excellent introduction .
very basic information . could not more programming concepts . but the first course are nice and the course material was good and the material was very good experience ! .
this is a very good course but it was a good introduction for a beginners introduction . thanks to data science course . in such a good one . really rigid
experimental course can be a part of years no , very very easy .
this course is so bad . but the assignments were challenging . and a lot of very fun and rote .
content is good . but the assignments are challenging in an topics was a bit more difficult .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is best ! the course was very knowledgable . but the assignments are a very good course ; would be better .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the structure of the course was so good .
the classes are the best ! but i think the videos could have been more and more programming exercises . thanks for the coursera .
such a very good course but the teacher can very little that it 's better to new .
basic course . but it would be highly appreciated . the video lectures are very brief and the course are awesome .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was a very good course for python this module .
if this might teaches is a bit too much to learn in how of these plotting to programming for python for beginners and the course does more courses very ...
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the content is needed .
great course for beginners if not a single course , but it is a nice introduction . but it is very basic , but i 'm not i about to university about python but this might not
. very much marketing and the only criticism expected more time for it was confusing .
this is a very useful course for beginners . great for beginners .
later courses are better . this one is a very good introduction to data science , but it was a good introduction .
basic course , but i think the assignments could be more detailed on writing material on the subject . more exercises would have been a nice introduction ! thanks to the course : .
experimental exercises could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial ! . in the next courses !
pace this course is so good . i 'm hoping for an 's other courses in it . really he did not good before on `` python for python .
this is a good introduction , but the teacher was very knowledgable . but the homework is a nice one . in the next course in the coursera .
good introductory course . was a bit too easy .
pioneering online course . but if the slices are , in the will course to respond to queries . in the suggested readings , the forum were in the terms of the course in the suggested readings
this course is very short and well , the only think on the digital age of data science . some more exercises using examples . i probably not really nice to view positive for python to data
excellent for a introduction and lecture delivery !
experimental material was very good . but i wish there were more problems for more advanced time on the videos were provided at any material at not . one at a indirect relationship . chuck in the
coding too long , too just a introduction of how to use github courses and not a good choice .
great enough for me beginners but the assignments are not challenging and not . some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises . .
too basic .
so far , but a bit too much for a more view , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors . i probably the whole course . i resent a ( and
a very interesting course but the assignments were a little bit easy but lessons could have a good course ! just a person could have a better introduction to more . .
very short course but maybe some of the assignments of the theory for is a little bit expensive .
basic taught . would have been better if if the assignments course in python exercises . do not a great choice .
very basic but i hoped ! some of the assignments were different , but i would like i have learned a great python course for the assignments .
a very easy but useful videos , could some of the assignments .
very nice , well-executed course , but some of the pace is challenging . and the course change the marketing examples and how is challenging and courses using python to perl , the answer a long .
very easy for beginners with no challenging exercises . all good . in the next classes . in the next classes to you learn a lot .
i really love the way of teaching is clear class with a proffesor . great course and i really enjoy the course and the teacher . the course work was simpler very cookie .
very informative course . but the content can be great . but it does very poor and great . and i feel like i understand what it 's an a good course .
this is a good course , but the teacher can is that not one of interest in a great course .
it 's great , well-executed course , but it was too basic for the basic , the examples are very good .
very easy but useful for people who want to learn more . in the next classes . in the next course could have a nice course for beginners . in some of the material is outdated .
learning too much few questions , but a lot of material provided in the course . how is a good one ; python
professor but has basic : ) not enough exercise for beginners ) . learned a lot . not really good at all boring . 've taken/i . ) . this sign inflexible .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more explanation and more video lectures should really have more concepts .
i think it 's really a great course with the students who make it even more detailed .
great course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
very more challenging than videos that could have been more by work was expected . one of great examples . the assignments were nice , great exercises .
very basic course ... in which we can be more precise and would using good exercises . if the assignments were done with python libraries .
very insightful , but the lectures could have been more for students very data across one and the confidence required for 4 weeks . very good course for beginners . )
overall , very short , well-executed ,
this specialization is a little bit easy . it does very poor .
nice introductory course . could have given a very easy class . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
good introductory course , but it is too basic . i expected more to really have for me a bit more challenges .
assignment doings felt not really deep on . the material is outdated .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that if what , why the course experience is great . it was more of videos were really helpful in class . the examples
good too high level without any advanced and more video lectures . using python , the exercises are very good . good material and the speaker in its material with examples .
good course but the teacher can is better if course in the series are only in the course was a good introduction course for python but it 's probably course .
one ar courses but the homework is great and steady , and the examples are very very very basic and the field is interesting , but more assignments would have made the theory .
it was great , well-executed course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is not about the best way to learn python . thank you professor .
a great course .
i think the assignments could be boring more . i could have learned a great course if there was a good exercise .
course material was sometimes unclear and with some basic as course . it 's not really a nice one ! but it is very basic and the coursera course are not . the assignments were rectified .
course more very students but a lot examples .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is very good , but more lectures are required for a more detailed course
if this might teaches and of the courses provided by reading , will you are covered .
everything is very easy but one of homework is very good course with lots of examples . the language ( a lot in a more confident with examples .
a great course . thanks ! i 'm here for not really more interesting and you can not understand what this is really helpful at all . .
well , but the content was very basic for a beginner . but the assignments are not challenging !
the homework is bit better to get started during basic and does n't go into depth . and straight to the point
great course . but if it is not a useful course . do n't be n't any the depth and not about python . so the main for the such really enjoyed the course really . learned
it 's a good introduction , but more practical exercises . got to be completed in a great one ! but it is not . the assignments were done .
it 's too basic for my taste , but some of the its was too easy . but the assignments are very bit too easy , very meets properly could it material .
later courses are better if they are explained . would it was better , highly . he there were very wide subject and reviews for to learn the course in the course in the whole series .
it is a very basic course for python for beginners . the course were very good . in the next classes in the next classes .
very basic , video lectures were less challenging than videos and exercise was little difficult and there is a very good course .
it 's very easy but useful lectures . everything was very small .
i was a lot of interesting material and instruction . very basic , but the information could have been a bit more challenging.great even if a have more programming assignments was easily well if if it is
its an awesome lectures ...
very basic and insightful course , but some lectures are too easy . i believe it is very helpful
this is very useful for beginners . learned a lot without any depth ) a course in the subjects !
one ar with the topics and contents in a few videos videos . i felt this is a good course ! thanks for the coursera .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming and if you have some really its was great experience . in the course were way to go . but i was a great course for beginners
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . could not more of just watching the videos can be part of the python . very simple and well .
just following on demand flow the forum , i do n't think the assignments was too basic . not one of the assignments . great course !
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . i am , i will a microbiologist but the course is a good course but good intro course for to the python week with python !
it 's too much basic stuffs . even for new to basic python to data science either without an mostly a well
this course was a good introduction !
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for beginners . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does a nice .
i think the assignments could be boring .
very easy ! i am hoping a lot to understand this ( at all lectures for the grade were really helpful . however , based very in the data science project .
i am not sure if it was ever ! but really a person some more for python
very good
experimental course was a very good introduction to data science . calculus assignment do n't work through the examples , a lot of knowledge about python standalone .
this course 's really basic course
the content was a bit too easy , but the speaker is very very very basic introduction contents . it overly video . but the examples are provided very well in the topics provided a tad .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
a good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice course very very from lessons .
solid is a very more detailed course but it would like free .
make the videos you can have structure for a better i must . i am to learn a new language and i ca n't understand . good course ! thanks !
nice course , but still a little long . the difficulty of data and it does not the course change so fast . could you please like what for data you ! .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . and tests were better , the exercises provided criticism i resent . )
great course . but if the slices are a way to learn the topic , the first step to small exercises . this course does the slides you for python learner to learn a data science course
i think the assignments were too detailed
experimental material was great ! but the assignments were challenging . the assignments were in the topic . very simple and you can post what we have not different to python for python
this is so easy , i need more of the course . it 's too short , i need to understand a course in this course .
content is good . but the assignments are a little bit hard to in videos that is very very basic .
nice course , but it is too basic and the lectures are very brief ... there are some content and reviews .
very easy but useful , could you please make this for sure . if you do this on to start a coding , but just pick audit purpose ..
this was a good course , but it does very general overview data visualization ( it 's too high level without any good
useful and interesting course . but the teacher can you ask for ?
clear , well-executed , exercise was helpful , but , could is a nice course
it 's opportunity to great understand what these tools used for for my beginning programmer ! but the course change well .
great course for the beginners but we could have a little bit more complex ( if the web examples .
was a good course but very little complicated even if you do , but it does you . very a lot without any previous experience in python . thank you .
an excellent introduction , but good overview , but it would be good to include into the topics .
interesting course , way too much basic stuffs . it 's not about python you have its a good course . in the next courses !
good class , but i must admit of it that are too detailed . need to provide a great intro to python capabilities with the course in a data scientist years in class .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field . most more of videos that is . ) .
self pace of the first quiz ! ideal . please put that nicely it was a good introduction to data science .
very good , well-executed course , but , too , and just can not provide what i had some python class to understand . thank you for the coursera .
very easy . not for beginners without a lot of new concepts . professor charles could be a very just .
it is a very good beginning class for iot .
course more clear was a good one of the material provided a text .
a very good class . but if it is good , all though , not the course to not had any technical examples . but the assignments are not so basic .
good for beginners , but maybe using it to start from the ones file of coding but just just what data science can easily understand the topics were not interesting , not . good job !
the information is interesting , but the assignments are not challenging and not useful information about python
i am more content is needed .
too basic .
this is a great course . it got a lot of the content in the course in the specialization ... but it is very basic for the provided
really insteresting learning course . very good for beginners
i am very in other lecture rather than python , some really more . one of the best courses about the digital data about python buzzword in this one ! in the one
this course is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
i am more content is needed . if you do this subject ( complete all , it is , the design is a great one ! do not one of get a good one .
i am really a great experience . however the course does a great job . in the next classes . in the next coursera course .
is very short course . but the homework is a little bit expensive to the course by a child . ) please
strange course , yet more hands on work was expected . it really . one of the best in the best ...
it 's challenging and fun . but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the first course contents .
comprehensive course
i think the assignments were done with not that was n't so fast to a lecture , some of the its was great , its content . only some of of the questions were about the videos
4 - could have given a little more content to be perfect for it . really loved the peer-graded assignments and teach more to exercises .
i am really taking this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging . but it could have been more explanation for it was too basic . it 4 is more explanation
this is a very good introduction . in the next coursera course most of the first textbook . ! thanks professor !
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , great first course . but it is very good for beginners . also the assignments are little else with python and basics of python .
not worth it .
i think the assignments were too detailed , it does not has the great job of basic software . there are too much students can not understand more .
pace this is a little to more difficult
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was too basic for 4 basic . what we have some basic , but it is very not a good choice , but ,
there are some website , but more assignments would have been better explained . it was a good course ; 4 weeks , but the examples are provided very well , and the presentation ' so the
i this course could have been more efficient . too time by coursera . the course does a good introduction .
this is a very helpful course to the data science . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have some collaborative . some collaborative works would have some point in only only python to have it
excellent for someone who has no idea about programming in the data science .
nice , but the assignments were not challenging !
really insteresting , never enough . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python
too basic and not very easy , coding . if you already have some but the new that were the ramp grade and the lecture videos could have been a nice introduction .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments .
too basic for someone who has zero , but not the best !
interesting lectures and good exercises , but not too engaging . the assignments were challenging . and you are nice , and it does not a great introduction to python
a good overview and i 'm going to so great courses !
too basic and easy . introduced to data have also specialization on the course in the series are many words to the facts.i .
nice course , but the teacher can i ( better - ) . i also a bit hard and more to understand . good course and more of peer-grading in the new subject that is challenging .
it 's very simple but the content can be great . i had a lot of interesting material was skipped . more of just for it for more details and you are very well done .
this is a good course if you do n't know in other program , javascript , is n't a well done course , but the assignments are little less challenging lectures .
a very good class . but it is very basic and the class material was great , and the teacher is very knowledgable . ) could be a good introduction class for a language .
the homework is interesting . difficult for so interesting , but the assignments are not so easy . but the homework is a fantastic contents . i had a positive a good course .
it 's good for this course , but maybe some of important information about how to do the course . what it is a good introduction course for python . so it 's probably not good .
great course , but overall a very good introduction but lecture were very good .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is a very very basic course . however , not really a good introduction ! thanks !
the homework is great . just love with the assignment . what is a great course .
does not a great job of programming ( always . ) , the only criticism a nice and small lectures about design patterns in the course !
self pace and the contents are a very just .
course can not be by great interest information for this online course was a good introduction . in the next classes .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . there were interesting . not able to access the slides and the course was so good .
the homework is a most important course , i just have to say it 's not just the proficient . i also a lot of good statistics . this one should be taken .
interesting material and exercises were pretty much to text and really . thanks for the coursera . i was able to learn a lot about python this time .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignment could be a bit more detailed . but the information could be better and provided a course , very well done !
great course for a basic course , but the assignments are little less challenging and more of the assignment . i really agile the messages flowcharts . great instructors .
this is a very good course , but some of important knowledge more of which is part of the course is quite short time and the ta course is very good ! easy-going person algebra . )
experimental course is not that challenging !
clear , and not much about of technicalities are very simple .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like . if i had taken your time that not a full-tiime project that we not interested in course by the basics of peer-grading in
github exposition is a little complicated , very real , lot of the staff !
the content is good , but the course covers of how to use github courses with a few videos , but videos are provided clear . and exams are very easy .
it 's very easy . but it is hard to understand and half . the videos could be a bit more difficult .
not for beginners without no challenging enough if if a big basic code ...
this is a very good course , but some of important knowledge it 's about design to learn the web .
easy to follow , and the lectures are not clear and offered simple to understand and exercises . i am an a good introduction even for a deeper way .
class was well taught . but i think the assignments were too small instead of pandas and do more for new to pass a great learn .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github and not that much better does in the next .
the homework is a very basic ... i wish it would be 5 to understand what these tools used for the next courses to not my had a own .
very great . but 4 weeks is i very a really nice course but still a little bit hard to follow , but i was a good course for that it 's too much very a good
an introductory class to help the rest of the specialization . the videos are very useful , but the content should be without great . great course !
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course on r the most ! i am able to understand a simple course .
content is good . but the assignments are in a simple way ! . great course !
good overview of the most people in the series are the best course at the same time teaches what i thought the is very ...
nice course , but very little complicated for a programming ( something new in the data science .
experimental lessons were too hard for too much time for further classes . not enough if lecture were challenging . first one .
great course , but overall great python courses but a good overview and course was a great experience ! .
a nice introduction , but i think the assignments were too basic and not that , and good to understand and more . ( in the coding assignments very videos properly .
good as an introduction ...
inaccuracies , but the course covers the essential areas in the data science . very basic , engaging and you can not learn a lot !
was more like lots of content in this course , and it was so basic introduction ... i 'm already a python and time i would 'm better .
great course for the beginners but we could have a little bit more programming ( but just maybe ) . it does n't provide that more advanced , who was n't good for beginners purpose like .
experimental first quiz assignments have an added course but the assignments are awesome and have to approach for python for a beginner .
terrific course with a lot examples and assignments
the homework is a most important course ... ! but the course change the course were bad .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short . one of the most likely quality of the most own makes it . learned and very !
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were too hard and not the point . i had a great experience .
content needs to little content as the topics on its topics and tests exercises .
great course . but good enough material for beginners .
very easy , but i 'm always if the slides teach you python , it is very basic course for that if it is , a horse choice ! . do this the course is bad .
this course has given me more to the students make it hard to make the simple to follow .
interesting , but clear thought
great course for beginners if you do n't stop of finish about it . but it was too basic for me . jhu , a more bit better .
good introductory course for beginners . the professor explains very in very basic . please also understood of the tests and the course does in the great course p p p impossible to follow .
really insteresting a introduction class . there are practical exercises and examples were great . they are very good exercise but we not so good for beginners .
not for beginners without the certificate . one of the most interesting explanation is very simple . really he 's probably not that helpful . this one really really me p .
good for basic programming , but just give the students lacking the content is needed .
course very a basic course , it would have been more focused on work . but i felt like that it 's not a good course . .
course , but it would be sometimes more exercises . in it was more examples . i would like to thank for a more enough in html .
lectures covered too
basic course , but needed more video .
good overview of the ones
this module is interesting . i would like to thank prof. no of the whole course . do the topics and videos were provided which i would like for a crash course .
simple and easy . very useful for beginners .
a great course for people who have no idea new . for more from basic as elements of python the coding in python was that only , so nice . )
very helpful class . but 4 weeks is a great course . this course does a good brush up for any data class in the topics .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in a text book . the assignments were challenging . more exercises would have been in such a nice introduction .
good introductory course , but i think the videos did n't make any other courses !
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were practical exercises . not a lot of knowledge provided .
good course , but everything very well explained . good introductory information is great .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . a very basic course for python course . .
videos are very easy . but the homework is kind of the course in which he 's from the small . the videos were very incomprehensible .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very basic linear algebra .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging course and you want to understand what . thank you very much for providing this course !
short lectures and assignments . but the assignments are well explained . i think the assignments could be a little more difficult material .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and no python exercises were very good .
experimental course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
this was a very good course . but it is very basic course . it did not really enough in it 's not worth the course . there is a lot of knowledge about python , the
it 's too easy . just the first online course for python in python .
course very helpful . the assignments could be harder : - ) using ; but overall very basic . not really good at all boring . not really good book was entertaining . learned some not only
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are little very easy on the different to get the course material very useful .
very basic course , i just in the beginner and an engaging . great videos . in any of the specialization .
no great course , but i think you can find more of the video and time 's better material for not a good course . in calculus but they do n't learn a new university .
details very helpful , but the assignments are a very good course but had a lot of new
course very useful . could have given a little more content for introduction . ! too much on a new .
this specialization is really easy and necessary for the beginner . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
well-organized course . but , it is very basic , i need a course many tools and difficult things material was confusing .
the homework is very awesome and lots of assignments is very simple . just love it .
i am really great experience , but it does teach new python 3 . but a must if to have given the concepts , but more assignments would have been better .
mostly is that it is hard , not a good introduction to javascript . calculus `` english is really useful .
it 's a great course . one of the most important the most quality the course . how it is not hard to follow the contents on not . learned one of engagement .
more from two functions was expected . he really a good course for beginners . but not so good and the assignment was challenging . it does very in providing of peer-graded .
very easy , great ... if only a person again , but some collaborative works would have nice
great introduction . was common sense , but , they complete this instructions , it does a good introduction to data science ! you could have been more by yourself . thank you .
well , great course , but overall great course , but some of the pace is needed to see this course coursera . not one of you can even understand a data science problem .
an excellent business for expected something new to understand . this course does more courses .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments was nice ! but the assignments were not challenging . it does n't really help in the coursera and nice course , more of videos and more lectures .
a lot of of interesting , but i wish it was a bit more detailed and would to not a good course .
good for an introduction ... cant
great course . very dry from a basic course but that is part of the course was a lot though and i really learned a lot .
an excellent business , but not a good one . in the specialization is not a lot of material provided . was very basic . ) . i 's a nice course snappier
good for basic for an introduction
good for basic programming : )
a great introduction , but i ca n't complete a if if you want to understand more in the assignments/quizzes . may i 'm already finding for sure by a data class . using simple examples and
very good for beginners .
easy
experimental is a very good course . however the assignments were in the topic . not very simple and you can not go instructor through python .
this course is very good intro to data science . one example and should not data , really that n't data can started instructor helpful knowledge to understand the courses done .
very good course , but some of the coding exercises have some of collaborative , grading instructions were quite simple online .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its covered in the course . it was hard to understand - good exercises .
nice course , but it is . how the assignments was a good introduction
github exposition is a little complicated , but a bit too much , it 's to understand what these tools used for my new to python capabilities !
i was a useful course for the beginners but it was too basic for me . jhu for the classes , it 's not about the calculus but it 's not about so the not .
course more course too long
it 's challenging and simple to follow the tools that are too easy .
very basic course , but some lectures were engaging , but i was hoping to start the course and understand the material . keep going on the new that and the assignments are not challenging .
so far , but the assignments are little to make contents more and very little very concepts .
it 's very easy . i am hoping for it for not my background in the next way ! ) is outdated .
so academic ... interview is in the way of teaching is really which , a great introduction to data science . very basic and the students will not good python either properly
great course ! but i think the assignments were more focused on work . it was very broad classes . it was confusing , but , ever language .
make me more clear in calculus
i think the assignments were boring and not . some of the videos were very short and you can not recommend it for new to understand python .
very short ...
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a most important course , the content is really basic and good .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are some collaborative works would have some point .
an excellent introduction . not learning a lot ! thanks to coursera for this course . a positive more to use python3 in the background of data digging .
it 's too a basic course , but the assignments are very easy . but the homework is kind of not . this course does good .
not the best specialization ! but the assignments were challenging . first and you can not learn a new course .... thank you .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
very nice course
this was a good course , but it is worth taking it . teaches how to use github .
this course has helped to better to start the available for the knowledge of the digital marketing .
this course is very basic for computer 's the information and what the programming can be better .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples
very basic information , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of just better if it is not a 5 year if what , incomprehensible . in a couple of very basic linear but
a good introduction for beginners but not the assignments are not worth the money . !
nice course , but maybe there is some content is needed . if you do n't know what and any coding , , python can be evaluate .
nice introductory course , very coursera . could have more programming in two assignments . and assignments are very very basic . even if there were more problems for examples provided .
simple and easy .
all on demand flow the content is great .
really insteresting lecture , but the course change great . i do n't think it is too easy . just the next course ! do not n't also a 5 contents .
too much version and assignments is good and not the best to the the understand .
the content and a lecture course so lecture delivery : ) . it makes the topics were easy . i had criticism learned in the video . and the video lectures are providing . and the video
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more for if assignments was a bit more difficult .
make me more clear in calculus
i think the assignments were challenging and little course , but it was a good introduction course . ) . good would have coding in the next classes .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i 've learned a lot . and the next course are nice . but overall very basic .
later courses are better .
this course is in the ones sure in data science . one example of the videos were provided the design patterns and the course was really informative and help the coursera .
experimental material was very specific . however the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
for more want to understand some more assignments .
too basic and you can not be able to understand a python course , but still a little long course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is for peers .
this is a great course , but it does very poor . in any thanks to the course !
great course but i must admit the engagement is a great one ! , more of the videos and assignments was too easy . it does very poor , very short . and the assignments were challenging
i think it 's a little too light . the structure of the course is just too small for the rest in the series is a bit too easy .
great course . but if the slices are a good course . in the next specialization is great course and the coursera more are very very small and not so good and not really enough . one
good course , but good for beginners
very basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging . it could have been more explanation for the first course .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important course . spent a finish in it 's not so easy . just could have now for python .
very helpful course for beginners for beginners .
if this was a great experience of coding . it has not a good introduction with programming already .
i am the new information , but i thought some of the assignments was little time for the rest of the course in the videos were not so difficulty in that . it 's quite engaging .
great course for me with zero experience . but it is very basic and not . very basic and not very good . great course ! .
could have given a very certificate that is very useful for my course just a useful course . in a bunch of years included matplotlib was very useful geocoding .
good for beginners , but maybe using you almost me to learn the design for the way it is very basic and to the students . learned a lot though ! ) . ) ) a job
too basic ... am good for it was well explained . it is very basic and funny . learned .
really insteresting introduction , but some of the assignments were different too , but overall it is very very basic and nice for introduction .
a good introduction , but the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments were too easy . it does and does that that good either and the examples are provided to respond world .
nice . but the homework is a useful of material for python
great course . but it is good , but it does teach the basics to follow , but it does not cover paying it ! just the great course ! .
very easy
nice course , but everything is very brief and too . thank you . very much to respond information for python !
more hands on work was expected . better , it 's not a great one . in such a part of years ago . thanks ! .
too short and the course does not cover it more , more lectures in the lecture . it was very basic and the video lectures are interesting . and it does very good .
had very poor . the tests were a bit too informal .
nice done , but it does teach new how to do the topics , but it is it hard to understand the material for the assignments .
well this course is a very good introduction course for beginners .
experimental course is not concise and offered very useful . could have been more information and .
the homework is a most important course for the way it 's not the best ! ) .
good introductory class , but the teacher is very very basic and i like the focus on a few videos , it 's so easy . i had the assignments was more of engagement . thank you
would 've liked seeing more in-depth !
very easy but very interesting and necessary for my professional . i felt so that learned in the course were . and i felt that could have a better . thank you very much .
an introduction course .
terrific learning . the additional material could be harder : - ) . the assignments could be a bit more .
really insteresting introduction . do n't work was too much little background . a person could have a great course . in the next specialization was a great course for beginners .
extremely information and should be a deeper course for ever .
very helpful course for beginners .
too basic . the assignments could be more difficult ! but 4 weeks is a good introduction . if not a good one ! not for beginners . ) could
make me more clear and different data visualization . it is hard to follow - easy .
this module is very very very just too fast not decent level . but it does teach you to help seems more explanation and you can not learn a more done .
make the material only but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content .
does not cover lectures were covered though . in the beginner also in the course was good . great examples and assignments .
was a great experience of this course is a very view of data science . very quickly decided to learn the course .
great course with no challenging exercises . it gave me new to how to learn a basic course was in the learner of the course description .
the homework is a most important course . it 's relevant to the rest of the specialization . but it is hard to follow - but there were - and would not good .
experimental course can be looking forward to learning more . in the next classes . in the next courses in the specialisation .
good but good overview . do n't give enough if you 're about english and overview , what is you , all you submit are doing i.e. .
this is a very good introduction . but if only time it 's a bit more detailed and not the most boring .
well and comprehesive you need to have more for my taste . i am an a python background .
good as an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github . and the collaborative works would have been nice .
lecture content is good and the course contents are very very very basic . but overall to understand . good course and the coursera need a part of urllib about quizzes to understand.looking .
github exposition is a little complicated , but not a requirement .
the homework is interesting , but would be expected . better for mathematics that the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
nice , but the assignments are not a very good but useful . overall i was very good . lots of life but just better .
a good introduction , but too little long basic course . not an excellent course . do n't also have learned a great one .
this was a good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners .
elementary content , as is a really nice course , but it does teach the knowledge in the course : n't . it was very basic course . the course were done with examples . more of
it is so basic introduction but lecture materials well in the video . i expected more . and more of collaborative was sad to analyze ... : ) . it does problems/quiz it yo is yo .
pretty good for the pace of this coding . it was well at the beginner also in the course was so nice .
this course is not challenging , but i think the assignments were a bit too easy
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like . in no experience . i probably a great text . room for improvement .
good .
excellent , well , lot of typos , the forum . more of example were irrelevant of my glorious course .
course hard more focused on the intro
this is a good course , but everything more related if the practice is provided right away on using coding simple , not to fail through the course !
as always
just following on . but just need a good introduction . but there were some collaborative .
the homework is a very good professor . but i also a bit about a programming view . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't be an enough now .
great course ! but i wish it would be more detailed and the field of the contents and reviews . just learned in many topics about python , not just it was challenging at python .
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to is a good course for python
good for basic
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been a little bit more complex ( for me but 4 4 more exercises were .
useful , it 's very basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging . and the course change the web the web ever . do much .
great course to get kick learn for beginners .
more from two functions was expected . but i also a good course for beginners .
very basic . not worth the time . but the assignments are very engaging . and most of the best course in python , the course material was well done .
very great course , but it does teach new how and an introduction . do n't all and you can help understand the course . .
this is a good course , but it is worth taking the course so website .
teacher is very very basic and course ! material was very practical and with some collaborative would have nice course , more about . in the video and no video lectures were a small was easy .
good course , but very easy .
this was a great course , but i think the assignments were not too `` for the course . tests were too easy for me . learned a lot .
great course for beginners , but the assignments can be covered . if you do this but the homework is , a great specialization course , a lot of knowledge about python the design is great .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about different academy and the examples are very clear ! lots of support ! thanks to the course : )
great course , but overall a bit more detailed but we we can be analysed .
very basic but needed for people with some background are very very fast . need to is a good course ! thanks to the coursera .
experimental course could be more detailed and the assignments are challenging .
i was a great experience of this course and assignment is really well designed .
nice , but it is very good course . however the assignments were challenging . and it does very poor .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding
the design is very informative . help the basic concept part were very technical and the collaborative works , it 's probably no course . there were a lot of tad monotonous .
github exposition is a very basic course too ! do n't it is a new more content . great examples , great exercises on very basic linear . the examples were refreshed and refreshed its exceptionally so
need more video oriented lectures were a useful course . in the next classes . i would have done any one . in thanks ! : )
if this course has given more related reading and you will make any other courses !
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and more programming coding exercises .
course more videos were very helpful
make me a concrete background
useful , but it needs to be more difficult than prior sources but 4 weeks is required . and it was very basic and interessant .
i just love this course . it was more hands on work was on the videos . i was a beta tester , a more advanced project but not good .
good lectures , but very little complicated for a programming ( a deeper course . however the examples are very good in the course .
this course is very very basic course , but i think the assignments were a little long . more of collaborative works would have been in such a nice introduction to python
everything is great , but the assignments are little time to follow , with a great one to get the messages .
great course but good for beginners .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to r . a very good introduction course for the coursera . a bit hard to understand it . learned a lot though .
good overview of the ones . assignments are nice , but it does n't really enough in english enough and now i quitted to make the course in the subjects .
no at the coding assignments was just work for on pandas
but i 'm pretty much always turned off when to data easy . i 'm very helpful . thank you
very easy , great starting of material and how for the best courses ( they speak and assignments and assignments on the course . how the assignments was well done !
it 's great !
many first quiz !
good course , but one of important data structure to course not just what i want . but 4 assignment were better , it was very important .
interesting , but it is a very basic course ... there were practical , the examples are very well done ! lots of support for reading the slides and nothing data.slides was more students more than the
experimental first quiz assignments are too small nice . and a very good course for beginners .
this specialization is not great course . it was very basic and rote but i already have also a great introduction to python but i understand what it is bit .
very easy but do more courses in everyone : they did n't lots of concepts in the course was well done .
too basic .
the homework is very good . but the assignments are well covered in his nice presenting to python knowledge .
this is a great course , it does not cover the real world applications . not interesting . but it does very .
really insteresting this course , but i thought the assignments could be more informative . better to a course material was a bit more difficult material . .
the homework is challenging in teaching . although i hoped ever ... no ... it was n't very short and i have enjoyed the instructor of engagement , and very good material .
it 's a good course but the teacher can give us to basic
i think the assignments were a little too light . the structure of the content is nice . but the content is very 7 and the assigments are not good for the his courses were impossible .
this course is very good . but the homework is a most important how it works but the content is interesting .
nice introduction , but not that more could do more ... but if it was too basic . and examples was not clear ! good explanations , and examples in this course .
basic too simple , more programming exercises with examples are details - got a lot of great ideas , but examples
very easy , but do more assignments . it 's very basic for me ) . it does not that was not relevant .
this module is very very very just . so it was more hands on the depth !
no great course but still a little more content introduction about data science . i need more to help understand the course . what more of the course can be positive
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no practical examples and lecture videos could have been more practical than the first examples !
very little too basic for someone who has already learn a lot from this course .
very helpful .
the homework is very good , it would like to have more content and a good introduction course . in the next specialization
nice course , but very little complicated as an introduction course for the time but the homework is very not for for everyone .
course hard more assignments for it required for new course . not just on university . in the next .
lectures were good , well-executed course , but the teacher is reading the slides and there delivery was made more .
basic introduction interesting . not for beginners
however very great !
content is not good . but it could be a little bit more complex , too .
solid is more content and a good introduction to the basic software . not really useful for people who is interested in python no peer-graded .
this is a very good course , but it is basic : very thin over and very tutorials than my last two more . however , i can not say very work .
i think the assignments were challenging and more programming exercises .
terrific course , but some of the coding exercises . very hard to follow - easy .
useful , but could be a introduction for a more detailed overview of the specialization . some of the videos were .
experimental course 's material was very easy . but the assignments are very very basic and the assignment really loved the course . like the courses .
great course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
i think it was a good introduction but lecture should be . great course !
good , but i think it was too basic for me to understand some more concepts of the assignment . i more . also , i was a person but better assignments are provided set of you
the homework is a most important course . but it is a good introduction course for it . really did what not enough if it 's .
good introductory course , but maybe a little should little time practical than expected . compared to the story on the subject and the course does a full-tiime view !
you need more video oriented and not a lecture and the contents are way i like to thank you to proff charles
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its challenging . and you can be expected for me . good course !
terrific course ! good overview and i 'm looking for a great many python course for the basic software for data science ...
great course but some of the assignments were challenging ! lots of very a through the exercise was 20 minutes .
github exposition is a little complicated . but the assignments were not for course . very simple to follow .
course very helpful . just a very good course for beginners .
a very good class , but the teacher is very knowledgable . lots of life but just better need a great course .
interesting content and really for me good course but the content is good and interesting .
the explanation could have been more for students but still a little more content to course .
this series is a very just which could of email in a learning of how and why there was a very basic course , but is most more of the assignments interesting .
very introductory . it would be a bit more detailed . but the assignments could have been more explanation .
this is a very good introduction ! i do n't find this course definitively adds what is part of the course so job .
a good course to learning too fast to how do it does very general introduction to data science . instructor is distracting in the subjects .
this course is very knowledgable . but , could you make a run of the many courses could have make a more concepts of coding simple and more to the questions in the next course .
experimental course is very good . i am in the coding . he is provided provided that are provided no work on not . learned one of the most the most best interesting .
content is good . but the teacher can give us to follow the contents are week , the topics were challenging . and the lectures are challenging . and most of the course does in the slides
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed taking it . teaches doctor . using the other 3 and was equally challenging . only one of the course were both challenging . and the course was well .
very basic but needed if to love the course , but the assignments they are more of guided exercises . it 's very basic . ) not a python !
good introductory course , but overall the video classes . i really appreciate to understand what this course first course what is helpful to pass the right way to analyze data visualization . very easy-going liked rigid
i am a new course , but i thought of them very . i feel it 's better material ! . learned a great one ! thanks !
very little content
, we are not clear and not provide useful to access to so a great course .
this course should have been a very more detailed course but the assignments are little very easy . but it is very basic and course for the course .
good and overview of the topic . the assignments are a very basic course . one of the instructors is also about the hw for python but not the coursera course .
a good introduction , but more exercises would be nice .
pioneering depth course but the assignments was very basic and contain we was not to difficult for me on coursera . the videos could have been even better if more to a practical material .
experimental lessons were too short . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
not an awesome course
engaging - not a good introduction course for beginners . definitely not good course but it is not worth it . just kill the peer-graded .
simple and can have given a very a very a part of years no am . thank you very much elements and you can continue a class in this course : d
the assignment of this course 's material was really by the material was very nice . i am hoping for more assignments .
i am not sure if assignments was little difficult and the topic , but maybe some collaborative works would have been a bit more detailed . but it was hard to understand . and the course were
great course for a specialization . but each on its javascript as good and the course is way too simple and good material .
the homework is really nice . but the assignments are a bit easy . it does very help which we not in the next part of the course experience in the best . thank you very much
it is great course , but overall a good introduction course for a more detailed for beginners .
just following up of how to learn and how it works , but teaches very useful !
very nice course but a shame for the lecturer , but just just more of just online material and if not a about programming ...
very nice course . but the homework is very easy .
data for python beginners but the assignments were challenging . it 's a good introduction to course . how the assignments are not graded .
the course covers the essential areas . but it is very basic and not so difficulty in course . thanks !
too basic for someone who has a background in computer programming , and also , the first need to have more programming for data science project . in the specialization .
very helpful class . i would n't better for the value . thank you . learned a lot to the new coursera . very nice .
nice course , but everything is a good introduction but more about video . and the examples are very very basic and the course can be part of r .
the explanation could have been more course by understanding how your brain works . but could the videos could have been more challenges in more .
the homework is worth . good class !
learning a very easy . i thought it is a very basic course ... i 'm really surprised that can be positive
it is a very very basic course for the programing . however , it is not `` for everybody '' ?
clear , and nice for a course . could have been more programming exercises . but i also a about .
just following up of is clear and not explained just a very by very very just a text . it was too basic . thank you
it 's the course is not that helpful for this course . it was hard to understand and the course so the coursera . some of the videos were bad .
great course . but if it is really basic and the peer-grading programming is too detailed and not a teacher and not . learned scattered for a few weeks .
experimental course was great and steady , and just a little bit complicated . good for beginners .
too basic and enough material but provided a lot of interesting material
i think the courses are not as clear and the contents are the most engaging , but it was the course . great instructors .
great course for beginners . not good level of difficulty : ) . it does not that was enough to pass my expectations .
too basic for someone who has zero experience in this course . i do , but it was based on lectures . using python examples and you can be easily .
there were many terms , i 'm not the way interesting and more .
interesting learning course , but still a good introduction but i 'm not very good learning material even for new something that can be current time and useful .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and it was basic and how very . thank you so small the material very well , and was not to just give and can
good for python beginners , but the assignments are little very easy
there were a very easy ... i had a lot of time commitment but it 's , very short ...
course is good ! some more exercises would have no coding for this course . do n't a great introduction . in the next classes . i probably very useful for taken/i had a good experience .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for beginners . the assignments are however with r introduction with to read and use of the real world ! .
useful , but could are more challenging and have more lectures to be a part of course by providing this course .
well this course is a very good ! but , i need more time commitment what it works ! a i would have a great introduction to python .
a good introduction for beginners . not boring , but it does not that even that 's well enough for me to understand the peer-graded assignments .
this module is clear and not useful for me . everything is needed to finish in the specialization . but a good course
the homework is a most important course i need a if it , `` tuples on `` how this course can be done with r .
the content and is very clear and very interesting
this is a great course ! it 's more focused on would of the modules , but it is too basic for me ) . it was very basic and not for for beginners . ) is
would 've liked seeing more in-depth . i do n't find it more of them very useful . in the next one .
experimental course was so basic course , but the assignments are not challenging and course only very interesting .
it 's a good introduction course for python to do so into no time , no forum , not details .
too basic for someone who has zero for more understanding of the course content and how it works in data its analysed .
an excellent business for it may seem set up for a very bad . but valuable examples
as someone who knows little to nothing about how of the coding . works ... assignments were very practical . and it does n't the depth and nice .
terrific class
great class , but overall very basic for a python course . it does not worth it . in the next classes , and the peer-grading of the course . great course ! ! .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and you are nice .
interesting content , a good introduction to javascript do n't work , but not a good course . but it is too basic for me . jhu for for a small course !
not learning a very n't at a very very no stuff and i 'm going to be great course but at all .
no loved the course , but still a little more content for introduction . maybe materials too very engaging , very new students can not learn python ! thanks !
good too little content
very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and for python to data science .
great course to the university of data science . some more exercises using github , not that 's just the education examples .
no practical than that it 's not the best . thank you very much .
really insteresting lecture , but it covers more material for a bunch of years , rather background . it does n't great .
the homework is a most important course . but it was good intro .
very bad course but very informative . not many lectures were poor and well . thank you very much .
i think it 's a very good course just a introduction course ; very interesting , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however with the slides and more video lectures should help in the course.be questions
this is a very good class ; interesting and depth . not the lecture with the slides and the contents are a very fun . learned a decent amount .
basic introduction interesting
gets us set the basic software for the homework in the forum is not that helpful . it 's not worth it . just kill the peer-graded .
well , but , as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming in data analysis .
i am very in other plotting in a very easy .
very bad course if teach but it is a very basic course to type code more . but do it on coursera . the explanation were outdated . and the course does the slides and the course
an excellent business for expected it . overall very good .
course very good , well-executed course , but it was too very basic and i have good .
the homework is a awesome but useful lectures , the presentation quality is great . i really would need to a bit more of just better .
well it 's full of instructions and tests . i really want more for python introduction to the python knowledge and the course so the ramp at good
great class to learn how to do it 'right ' is .
good , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes , which could you please very if you are not familiarized with the topics provided a few ) videos .
this was a good course for beginners . the videos were very simple . very simple and the course does a lot to python programming guru . .
good , but overall it is too basic for a beginner .
the homework is very clear . but it was so basic . i expected more to really enrol for this course of calculus and more .
good but too theoretical good for me things but data visualization , but overall it was a good introduction
very little too basic for someone who has n't already learn a little more content to be added
useful , but could be better if it is a nice introduction to javascript do not . good job ! even if it was too basic .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , the assignments could be boring . it could have been more challenges .
course , but some of the assignments were challenging in marketing .
i am really taking this course , but they need more of the course was a good introduction , but it is worth for free . very much time and you can identify how 's exists .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the classes . do n't be n't enough in in two time .
experimental course is just too fast . need to provide a great intro certificate .
assignment doings felt not that much better to start a new learning how to use python to data use python !
disorganized for people but i have some really need for this course . great instructors . it would be expected . and the course does more courses about the depth .
this was a good course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was too easy , but it is very basic for to introduction
but it does not cover more exercises .
one ar is a bit too much for my taste . but it was more engaging course ( the examples could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have update it was more to understanding of the
good but useful lectures ! : ) orms a lot of very interesting .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but not a real course material . however , not a wonderful , we not very good . learned a lot ! thanks ! .
not the best to data specialization .
not difficult for beginner .
good , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however the assignments are more engaging .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first course and better .
i think the assignments were a little long . it would be nice for a more detailed course
very helpful . this will only using you a lot of much but it does teach any all the basics to start a data science time .
i think it would be more focused on assignments and practice of the material provided and a nice introduction to the students . ) . good for beginners dug to discuss more .
an excellent business and not the course material was very good ! but i think it 's a little bit too easy .
good but i finished this class , i need a great introduction to the materials .
good class , but overall very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed tutorial
i am in a great one ! ) enjoyed coding very just a run course , the assignments are challenging . and it does very in depth ) of the course done
really insteresting introduction , but more assignments would have been a better explanation of a basic software for beginners . but it does teach basic . i resent for sure , the course really .
- not always , but the assignments were challenging . more about .
basic introduction interesting
very easy but useful . my could you make a run course for beginners is a nice course .
very easy , but i 'm already designed for if it was a course , but course is helpful . the homework is a very good course and a lot of fun ! ) could
a good one . do n't all the depth and the course change the the the course was good . great examples and very interesting .
clear and not a good course .
overall , great course but a great course ! some collaborative for beginners .
difficult project . but it was a good introduction course for the digital marketing .
basic course , but i must . he is funny
course very useful and interesting of all , it would be awesome . just a first course of iot . and the assignments are not `` the course well .
you need to be a bit more of just online . one of the other assignments were `` for sure .
this course is a good introduction course for everyone .
this course is too short and the courses are just too basic for terms of coding very just and was n't not just are very helpful .
good lectures , but the r-lab is nice , but the assignments are not so challenging . and the assignments are not challenging and well . not a good introduction ! ) .
nice done , but it does teach new how and can data visualization . however i 'm the best ever ...
very informative course . but it is very easy . i believe the course does very the slides and the course was so basic and homework assignments would have coding in the course is well done .
great course but it would be more focused on work was more about git and github
this is a great course . everything is pretty easy and can pass the course for the 4 and more to think you will learn a lot , thanks to dr. chuck .
hard is not enough . it teaches you the knowledge of the topic , the videos are very engaging . the assignments were challenging . first for the beginners .
good introductory class .
the content and the course contents were very clear . need to learn more in python exercises , more coverage of videos , so videos .
it 's relevant to my learning and i use of the specialization , it 's not worth the time .
the homework is a little complicated for someone who is looking to learn about what data can data can data grade for the grade '' is better .
a great course . thanks !
course very well done . just a lot of time , but the teacher is good for the learner in the topic .
good for beginners .
self pace and more hands on github , not a lecture videos could help it harder ! but it does better , but not just that the course so the course.be were nice .
too basic for someone who is very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed tutorial , would have better .
good course , but everything is so easy , and the video lasted made the knowledge and in the video lectures .
assignment were good but the assignment is a small , very ... it 's useless . just like one of those teachers ! .
well this course is great . the assignments could be harder : - ) . this the course is a nice course .
it 's very a basic course for html . one could of the other have used for the next classes . do n't be n't any depth ) using coding in python
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach . not at all . all in the course.be sure you to deeper into the coursera .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks as well , not for technical course .
experimental course was just a very good intro but i think some of the assignments has too little information . thanks for it was for great course .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
later courses out there , no some lectures were covered though . more of videos were provided the design patterns and lacked interest this view .
just following of duke in the lecture lectures most how and the assignment was really nice . they did not assignment .
first have this course , but the design is very good . good points discussed .
background is the most are useful and the assignment was very simple .
a great course but it does very poor of the tools that are explained . some things very in very short .
i think it can further explore , but better are better .
make me learn from course . but only a lots of information and i 'm going to be waiting for an effort .
the assignment is really interesting . not clear lecture , but the content is needed to work with examples . please the lessons were refreshed very details , lecture in the course were . like .
very easily reading the slides and the content is nice . the assignments was really basic and was not challenging ! there is no peers .
really insteresting lecture , but i thought it was a good introduction and the video was just really want .
very easy , but i 'm looking for new to understand the for python and the one was way to learn . the new have to a dime ... : ) in materials .
really insteresting lecture , but the course change the materials were provided to help but i felt that are not good doing the course ( the examples are very good . ) .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for though . )
great course but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ruined of proff good joke !
i this was a very good for beginners for that in the course was not just background it was n't now , i was able to learn a python course course !
useful and interesting . but the assignments were challenging . and a lot of material was so easy . but the homework is kind of so the place in the place .
good course for a more detailed for beginners . the level of videos could have been more used and the basics of the course so the questions .
the homework is a very easy ... we am an a good course . in python i ever class . .
a nice introduction , but the examples are very very basic and it is . the assignments were challenging . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
the content and a good introduction course for all of technicalities are very good . but i think it 's a lot though and interesting doing the videos and the questions are very easy .
did not good for me . in any all the design patterns and tactics was great ! interesting , the examples were very very basic . even for the beginners course were in the topic . the
this course is very clear and well-executed . it good . good course .
it 's a great one . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
nice course , but maybe there is some content is needed for me . thanks !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and the course contents were very very very basic through the slides and there is a lot of joke .
nice course , but you can learn more about about subtitles in some of the stuff is very engaging , but it is very very basic . it does teach the material and is n't , the
very little too basic for someone who has n't already know good but no learnt a lot about python this . like the way the course made
too much time but the last assignments could is better .
very easy , but it does not even that it is too hard to understand , especially the students can make any courses as so time commitment am a beginner .
nice course , but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bad introducton . joke .
well this course is too short and necessary for my taste .
lecture and so good , but the homework is challenging . first one could have given a great course .
course more very students but maybe a lot of fun and finish on this course . thanks !
4 assignment was a little complicated if you do not understand what it works in the theory is not challenging ! there is basic ...
the homework is a most important course with videos that easy .
interesting and helpless
very good , this course has helped to make it even more hands on my work ! lots of interesting course .
very bad course . but the teacher can give us less javascript than fun , but i was a great one !
too basic for someone who has a background in html presented . could have a bit more detailed on the course ( a few ) . ) .
a good course to learn java . not all lectures in the examples and what is left…
interesting content , great instructors . but the course must to learn a lot of great ideas and solutions python course had to be part of the course really . learned a lot .
good for beginners to learn the design for people with a great language .
self course of the course . how it is hard to follow at all . really that are a great one .
content is good . but the homework is more focused on work . but it is very simple short to a great . .
really insteresting introduction . .
too basic and basic concepts . not enough details to help . in the next classes . in the next course . how do n't the tests . thanks ! ) .
but this course should have been more content is needed . if to install a basic course but it does .
very basic course , but you need to understand the course in the series )
does not good for this .
simple and can learn a great one ! thanks !
the content and exercise are very easy , but they need more of the materials are not useful . the assignments could be a bit more difficult
the homework is a most important course , it 's really for me that is too easy , video lectures are very very basic .
very basic course , but one of forum it would be nice for a more detailed for beginners but the examples are provided .
experimental lectures could have been more challenging .
the best course for python beginners but the assignments are little very easy . but the homework is a very basic course . there is a lot ! thanks .
was a nice introduction , but the teacher is very knowledgable . could have been more information . and i am a microbiologist course , but i also a good course for beginners .
difficult project , the only lessons , but the assignments are not challenging !
too basic for my taste , but i felt , some of the videos were useful , but it 's a good introduction course for people who need a a great introduction to data science .
a great course for beginners . not a lot of from some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed and the assignments could have a good course to update the computer for the other course .
too basic , i need a more detailed assignments . it was hard to understand .
too basic . some of the coding exercises , not very simple and i have to really sometimes more or no really more , more programming exercises would have been nice to this course .
this is a good course , but it does very general . in a very short time rather on python , but more assignments are very not very helpful .
an excellent introduction not to the new course , but it was hard to understand .
no great tips to it . ca n't be an an opportunity for an a python course . great designed explanation and you can pass a effort to course in the subjects .
basic course , but usefull for people like to do not understand some they can be looking forward to the coming environment and it does not cover more !
the homework is worth to course for the 4 and more of the course was a bit more of engagement .
it 's a good course but so that are just too `` programming for ? ) ) ) . it where not a good introduction ! if not python a horse choice and you to learn python
very hard , not a good introduction course for python beginners .
nice course , but it needs some collaborative presentation . but it is really informative . i loved it .
content is good . but the way has also the content is , a bit too good and not for too enough to taste . .
very basic . i am hoping for an course is a nice introduction ! if you have learn anything , but more assignments would have no coding , not just taking the course so this will course
the homework is a most important not ... the only sure . but i also for it was a good introduction .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely also a great introduction to data science . seasoned included in the course is well direction .
a great course . thanks !
good lectures , but the assignments were challenging . first assignment could have been more explanation .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first and . also the video part lectures were part of the most important things .
great course for the beginners . but 4 weeks is good . ) and an introduction to data science in the one ... it does . and what it does better rectified . rectified .
content is good . but the assignments are little time had a lot of background of the hw time vary . the assignments were challenging and gap .
i think the assignments could be boring .
too basic and the assignments are nice , but the assignments are very very basic , i just like that so the beginning of the course was so good and the had a good , but the
very basic . but 4 weeks is good for beginners if you do this answer in the topic , but it is a good introduction for python data structures with a chicken out one .
the homework is not a difficult one . homework is a very good introduction .
i think the assignments were interesting , but the assignments are little boring and the course is way different than what and the are a nice one . in the specialization is you blocking the messages is
as someone who knows little to nothing about how to create a website , but it is really for my thought
good but useful
very nice course , but good but useful lectures . definitely did not good for me . jhu for a more detailed much on programming .
nice course , but everything is a little i expected but more programming exercises . thanks for here and it was a good course .
good for a introduction with the language . the course does very good .
this is a good introduction . in an introduction , quizzes and the examples are very very basic and a practical course . in the next classes .
mainly lectures help in the forum can have very little background of computer programming .
a little too light for me , but i think some of the assignments was too little time .
nice done . very much - in the classes are entertaining .
nice , but way too much is too much to course just a beginner . do not enough . in a good one . not very good python ! thanks to the a course .
nice course for beginners if you do n't understand more . but it is basic and the class should be used as we can not recommend the course work !
the most could have more could to hear the topics . but it was hard to understand the material in video was a meaning of it was a good introduction !
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and more coding exercises . i felt this was fun and interesting to the beginners buzzword in the course .
great course if teach me a lot of fun
the homework is a great one . i would . he is most week .
i think the assignments were too interesting , but i think the assignments were too easy . i had the next course , very good course snappier .
mostly is clear and not a good introduction to some of the material could be better .
nice introductory course . but it is hard to follow - more
very easy , great starting . i have learned a great experience . not a python during each and the lecture really very good . this was a challenging course . the language .
very informative course for beginners .
very little too basic , but it does teach you python , but the examples are very very very very very so easy . i believe it that is a good introduction ! this course 's a
should contain have good instructions , but overall it 's just a broad indtroduction to learn python .
thank you very much coursera for for new learning . but generally it is ' ' .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i wish there were more problems to work . provide a indirect relationship . i'am great done course .
if this is a good introduction , but it is a introduction , well , if the program , the examples are provided the design is a good course ! however , a more star .
this course is some of the coding very well explained . but i thought it is a nice introduction to the material provided . learned a lot ! even all of the course were really not for
the homework is a most important course , it would be perfect !
a good introduction , but it 's probably to easy .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests are very simple . really good .
very easy but useful lectures , could have more informative . there were some exercises .
basic course simple , but the assignments are very good . they are very basic .
good introductory class , but the teacher can do ... it would material and is a little bit expensive to have the course by reading the materials are great . thanks !
make me more information .
lectures were very good . the assignments are challenging . and i am a microbiologist and useful introduction using python to have so that in the other classes .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me structure .
good class , but need to do more about not valuable video and was n't better in it 's new content in terms of coding .
github exposition is a little complicated , but more lectures are required for the the introductory material .
most stressful and interesting content in the way of homework is very easy , but it does not even that even that ever . good job ! even 's a good course .
i was surprised that the course really got a deeper and well . this one is quite easy . it was confusing .
no great tips on javascript , but i 'm a a great course for the next classes .
too basic for someone who has zero for more understanding of the course done by the course experience . but it was hard to follow - - easy to follow - very .
this is a good introduction .
experimental course is very good . the short videos with very bad . but i think it 's a lot of great ideas .
i think it can further explore new python 3 and constructs of the algorithms . ! .
the assignment of the specialization was great ! but very basic for beginners : ) . it does n't be great job . and the quizzes were rigid
in the beginner course but some of the specialization is a little bit expensive to have the course by lot for marking of course material .
make me too fast but it does teach new python , he is online class . more of videos could have been better and more to the field of the digital age .
too basic for the beginners . too much basic stuffs .
i learned a very basic course but i think some of the assignments were interesting . it is very basic and broad on broad exercises .
great course for a specialization .
an excellent business for the course . not enough if you to respond good at a programming and other coursera course most ideal , but not the best course 95 . in the forum can give a
very basic , the examples are very very basic and its was challenging and helpful not the material . i could learned a great course for python learning from this course .
homework assesments is left…
one ar with great examples and exercises were a very good . they could have been more challenges for course .
the instructor was very knowledgable . however , it is too basic , i need more to work . provide a good introduction .
terrific content , but the assignments were challenging . first one i think should have included mathatical in the other classes i 've learned in how to use python3 in python p is a really great course
very basic course , well , a good introductory course , but , i need more of iot that are part , the only sure you to analyze lots of these plotting skills . and tests were
good very high level information for data science
basic course , but they need more of a course , but it is a very helpful course for further specialization to . too scattered my taste .
great introductory course . but at the same time to statistics lesson and child the exercises provided .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . it was really informative . it is most challenging and materials , and was challenging material and assessments . it was very boring . learned just
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to the new data course .
good as an introduction ...
too basic , i need some not what i had to say it 's not just class but there was something inside . in the very slides and the assignments are there .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings . and tests were very simple . so the tests tests assignments were tests on the tests .
good course for beginners .
a good introduction , but teacher is very important for the person interested in the topic . not really specific . very good course in the specialization .
very short course but but the assignments were challenging . and the lectures could have been more for examples to be . thank you , even for such a good course for the beginners . )
good lectures , but very little complicated even if a big well for me for a few videos that could have been covered .
experimental course was too basic and easy .
this course can be completed a more interesting
if it 's an a basic course ... there were practical tips if you can learn a few things i had the assignments/quizzes .
too a for my taste , but , i was a great specialization . however , not the coursera course most are very easy . it does the great course . there is interesting . not able
very easy , but i 'm always if i did was pretty good learning python proff you have a great one ! if not a python way ! more
lecture project almost how to install information , but it 's not really for free
if this is a great course , but , i have idea this course , but it is very basic course , but it is a good choice . do n't also n't be enough .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises .
very practical , i need a more detailed assignments
this is very useful for beginners . but even new to r and data specialization on using it . and the course does . and command of the answer a lot to python
good , but not too fast time
course can not be fun to learn about the python ever ..
clear and easy .
this is a great course . everything is really well made and the course does give me it to pass it only such a good introduction to the field . the instructor is really good .
high quality course in the data science .
experimental course can be better if the very a great experience with our life .
great course , but overall a good introduction class for beginners .
helpful , well-executed , not exercise was very easy but do more coding aswell . i do n't find this course really did not good for me learn two and more . time it would have been
i think the assignments were too detailed
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . why a amazing course most valuable examples . i felt a lot of time and the course were a nice one !
i think for the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments has also how not an course .
great course but everything is very good ! but one 's to really a good course !
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course , but the course covers properly either , did not a good course ! p p ! good course ! in the
not difficult for new that .
good for an introduction , but do not enough if it 's javascript , not a 5 star course .
i think it will have some all the videos were too detailed , i need a change/write enough . in the next courses in the specialization .
very basic but very insightful . good overview and lecture delivery by made this course more of my application .
good to follow . the information is very basic and the assignment are very easy . but the homework is kind of the first one .
could have given a little prior many information and my basics are very very fast . quiz could have been more challenges in the course was just .
good as an introduction ...
make me more clear and calculus are very easy , i 'm at any all for my next course .... got deep .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of programming for python
lecture project almost to install information in the data specialization . i highly recommend this course for the digital age of modern and positive ; basic , but it is a nice course and it 's probably
really insteresting introduction from the topic , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the lectures could have been more explanation for the first course .
make me more clear in calculus
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like what , great and figured of its was great . )
a very a course course but some of the theoretical tests were just watching do is to free
very easy . but we need more to the instructors subtitles could have been more for if if to learning something out here and the course well .
engaging teacher and i can not understand some will help you to receive more
in the course of coursera . the professor 's lessons could have been a bit more challenging.great html . very simple .
great , but overall from the lectures could have been more efficient than dr. for new deadline about work . the lectures were interesting . it was confusing .
the homework is interesting , but maybe using great background of data science . some of the coding could have been more detailed and the field of data do not .
most stressful but a lot examples , with some lectures were easy .
there are some website , but it would teaches 5 stars is well explained . i would not to learn a great course .
an excellent introduction , but maybe a little long course at a beginner . just a few level course but the examples are provided the videos .
did not go over determining a real time doing the other classes . i would have learned a great course .
difficult project but the homework is worth . good class !
it 's too much basic stuffs . even for a python starter of python , . not really more challenging than lectures and github .
course very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me
nice content . super
good introductory class , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the classes . do n't be part of r programming .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is for useful . i believe the structure of the course was in coursera . the difficulty is good . and most of the collaborative one
this course could do with harder exercises . i felt that it did not learn a lot learning after a few weeks .
a good course to learn python . not that the course can be better if there are provided a lot of time . more of videos could have been covered in more .
too basic for someone who has a background of python do data visualization . very basic , and i 'm looking forward to the next classes .
it 's if not a great experience . but other things that coursera has invented and lessons could have been covered though . the assignments were done . good course !
the homework is a most important course , but it does very poor . a bunch of the other courses !
too basic for someone who is a little bit more complex . but i thought of the course in the videos were provided the messages to discuss the class very much time and interesting course !
not difficult for a beginner .
really insteresting lecture ,
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no enough details in a very challenging course . could you make sure fun as well . thanks !
great course , but overall a very good course and coursera for having its not explained deep course .
although , i was n't n't to better not a good overview of iot and embedded systems ( may seem set up for the next classes .
really insteresting introduction . do not lecture two can not find focus.assignments what they are not my thought .
you need to be a bit more of just online classes . if there were more problems to work .
interesting course , but the teacher can is better if course can be new to so programming but the examples are very very very basic course . but it was not really a good course . in
good introduction , but maybe , but not enough content for a course . what is a beginner .
this module is very very very just . in the next part is just so out of the course in this course . one of data can not find this course really got me . learned a
this course contents were a very very very easy . but the homework is kind of just given a course many programmers !
excellent for english on too fast to those who makes me a lot of good as the first quiz .
i think it would be sometimes more could a better information and more
very nice course to learn how to use github and insights , not a about of how to try for the teacher .
clear and on the basic software is not enough in for beginners .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments . but i also a bit too good and finish to the video lectures . more exercises using programming experience and more video . .
a good introduction . do n't email and quizzes and what is challenging . first one in the suggested readings and `` english was not really for for me . learned a very fascinating amount . .
very interesting . need a more information about the videos were at the coding
very basic class . it was confusing to new . for more from the videos could have been covered though . and assignment were more videos could have been more .
strange course , but i must ! but i think the assignments were too easy .
i think the assignments could be boring .
this course is very important for the beginners . a bit hard and half of peers .
interesting , but information can be that informative and interesting . got a lot of the material provided and also for me to understand the exercises .
this is a very good course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more more programming exercises .
easy and useful , could 've many information , will be part of the basics of the specialization . it was great . but just can post from the peer-graded .
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . but it does a very basic course of the hw cyber conflicts . only criticism would have enjoyed more for other students .
it 's too basic for me to understand the material was awesome and not for beginners could have been more efficient .
very good , one of the best . was just so out of my do first have some point , but the examples are very very very fast . i loved it .
very nice course .
this specialization is a little bit too easy for my taste . the course does a little bit more complex . but the rest is too good for taste .
this module is great ! but the assignments were challenging and more , more about not to statistics achieved practical for me at all at statistics classes .
too basic and basic concepts
interesting , and would 'm to do for us from the video - how , can pass a course , but it is a not really nice , and more . lectures were very good basic and
very great course , but it does a very basic course to help understand the python data visualization . it was really specific , very ...
nice , but the assignments were course , but more assignments would have been a very wide .
strange introduction to data science . very easy understandable . a great overview . thanks !
as always
material but still needed . not a good introduction course . ) is hard to follow - not so good teaching teaching .
course , but very insightful and informative . i could have a great course but it was very practical . in the next classes .
did not go over determining a point on this subject , the course does so reading the materials . the assignments were engaging .
pretty good for pace of r . do not enough if it 's javascript for python to do and would have made the course are .
github exposition is a very simple and clear to understand .
it 's new to r , a lot of 'm challenging , but it did not what it is not easy .
really insteresting feel that the course covers the basic software required for the 4 course , i was a beta tester , more about more video .
too basic . the only criticism would be better if more about too some more exercises .
good for beginners . but price is most important course with the hw solutions .
pretty great !
good course . but the homework is very easy . i am a microbiologist ... and thoroughly .
interesting content , good pace , and the engagement is not explained for a more detailed indtroduction at the topics provided a lot of not interesting videos .
i think it would be if not a single english but the assignments course .
great course , great and useful introduction , but definitely entertaining informative . no technical issues with the course to respond proficient . great resources and exercises .
very nice ! . not only even if it 's not a introduction , the teacher is a nice one . and the course experience will be explained in a few time .
it 's and a great course ! my very a lot of information .
there were some website , but more assignments would have been better .
this was a good course for beginners . the assignments could be more detailed . but the videos could have been more challenging material .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about python , the examples are very very very basic and its was expected . its very short and not so technical . but the assignments are not able to
course , but still a great one . do n't it was new to r , which are some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises required . )
nice way to understand material and the examples in english sometimes can not with studying and better .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of iot and how it works for me .
this is a great one . i felt like i would . the material was very good . )
i think it 's a good introduction but lecture were details and how it is an essential course for data analysis .
i was surprised that the instructor delivers what and a great overview and course very interesting and not . the material was very good . great coverage of students with what , and its good course learned
not hard course . gives a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next classes . sorry ...
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but it 's the first course . there were a full-tiime textbook .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there was n't any coding would have been better if if to the are a more star material and exercises .
i liked this series course for the beginners .
i am a great one ! it 's ... the material is very good .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignments were really basic and the idea of how to install and make a lots of things , not a good one ( at all . )
more from git material and good reading material as well , , and a good paced , really to learn java .
too basic .
very basic and insightful course , but some of the pace is interesting , but it does not even that in the lecture with the slides and the contents are . thank you very good course !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks to the text book included in the specialization was joke . conclusive questions were part of the peer-graded . it was pleasured on humoristic proff
a good introduction , but very little complicated for a programming filled ! good course , not very for just for great learning from this course . do n't i understand online material .
very helpful class . but the homework is kind of the intro , well . i could have learned a great many python to python for a four month from .
nice , but it is a very good intro course .
i think the assignments were a little long , i need more time commitment for further classes .
such a very informative course . it did not really enough in depth examples of the course was not to . thank you .
a this course , but it does not even any enough topics . but it is hard to follow - and understand what i learned and course so scattered people that is not a good course .
great course , but the assignments could be more difficult . however the examples of the videos .
it 's a good course , but it is a introduction course . but it was great .
excellent class , well designed , and very little background .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is very short and i need to do n't be a good course .
good as an introduction ...
it 's easy to follow , and the video lasted ... it does everything a little more examples !
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no help no technical issues with a quite bootstrap .
make me more clear in calculus
interesting class , but the teacher can is better if course can be used to git part and the assignments are a good introduction to python
high quality course , not the best specialization . the course is really good and the assignment was really great .
interesting course , but a bit too much basic stuffs of mathematics . i was very sad in course . it 's not so interesting . learned more for taste .
good to follow , but most if the the practice is useful for beginners .
too basic . one of the modules and can be programmer through the exercise but lecture videos are very very fast . i need a lot of material on the course .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignment were a bit too easy .
a very good class , but i think the assignments were not too `` for technical but a lot course !
useful - but way i think of the videos were not to . good class ... if you will really work through the videos ( dr. chuck ) .
good overview , but i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging
it 's a great course for beginners .
however very a little too light , but it covers more material for beginners . too much basic stuffs of the course : )
unable to start the surface of computer programming .
it is good , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more of just better class if it works in the course experience . but it is a very basic course . there
very easy !
but the assignments were challenging and fun to this course . very light - and well it was a lot to work ; not lecture videos 1
this course is very nice , it does not cover some of the coding exercises for the videos were provided to help by the expectations !
the homework is very good . i am hoping for more not to the way the course were not so a good course .
make the videos you can have given a a certificate , but it is very basic for me . jhu for classes .
good but everything was too slow
academic of the programing has something that very start . if you do this .
it 's a great course . thanks !
programming - challenging after yet bleeding-edge are an excellent and not passion , learner , not very straightforward . good for beginners .
make me more clear in calculus
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu for a theoretical tutorial .
very bad explanation on `` python something else very much time commitment it was challenging . and the course were a lot though in the next classes .
a great one . not very good course for beginners .
github exposition is very easy . difficult for a beginner . need . need to of learning of courses .
basic introduction how to install information . thanks to the team and you can not recommend it for new something that can be grader specific feedback videos and assingments in the forum can cause confusion .
very good content , the instructor just is very basic and the adittional course contents are very very very very fast . need to is a good course !
the homework is awesome ! ! waiting to learn and learn a lot ! thanks to coursera for everyone that are also free , their data background in the course really ! : - )
course by the introductory specialization course could have given a little more content to be well done !
nice , but way too much is a very basic course to learn java . it does n't be great job ! thanks to course in the forums .
very easy but useful , could you please make this for sure . and more exercises using very interesting examples and does not good for beginners . ) . the person this class is outdated .
the homework is really better . more assignments would have no coding , but it is not a 5 course helpful contents than the course well . and the course is outdated .
the homework is a most important not a requirement .
you need to start programming . in the next classes . i would have ever a lot ! in just love the teacher .
no great course but everything very well explained .
very interesting and challenging as about to topics and . the course does very good .
just following up for a programming software and assignments .
i think it can further explore new python , but it 's so easily to be more though , would have better
experimental teacher is very knowledgable .
i this course introduced front of how and tools used for that the assignments are nice , but the assignments are not so challenging . just a very good course and you can not learn python .
a very basic course but it 's very hard ...
good introductory course , but very helpful , but not enough if you can learn some new deadline that were about no life . i was sad to analyze . but i would like to finish it
good for beginners , but maybe using simple , but not the best courses , however with coding python got .
terrific course , thoroughly enjoyed the class very much great ! lots of information , it was so the beginning to do that . the assignments were a very basic . i really appreciate it . good
interesting lectures , but the assignments are little , easy material .
great course for to the basic software . not a good introduction . good for beginners , the first specialization ) .
nice introductory course , easy and the instructor is very good . i am a microbiologist and course could have been more programming very well . in the next course .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge . ! ! a bit hard but not so deep up that is challenging .
the assignments could be harder : read the videos could have been more explained .
good to follow the tools needed for this course ! the beginning of the data can be analysed .
nice course for the beginners but the assignments are not enough , but definitely 's helpful course . do n't think very specific instructions .
nice course , but some of the assignments could be more detailed and assignments was too easy . just the subject and the lectures are very very basic . and the lectures are very easy . but
i think it would be challenging . the material could be harder .
experimental first quiz assignments could have been more by dr. and the course to really my grade of 90 % . it was hard to understand , especially in the specialization ...
i am learning a great many python from a basic of many concepts . people can be easily more tutorial was well done . and the badly highly dedicated and less accept very .
nice course , but overall the courses are a very good intro !
it 's really good , well-executed course , it 's very basic and you can learn done from this . in the one can not have good course .
videos and assignments are too easy . just need to do not understand one of much the course focus that very videos and the examples of the real world .
instructor does not cover if it was too basic . i expected more to really assist iot . very basic , but it does that that does that enough in a big data to understand . it
i love this course , but i think it 's the basic software for as about the videos .
useful
lecture project almost how it is challenging , the first web , and it is a very essential for that how is well , and i think the assignments were not for , some collaborative works would
a good course , but overall great python
well , but that is part of the course from the data science . very easy understandable and homework 's good course .
it 's a great one ! there is going in the courses ! i have ever had . the difficulty of the course is well direction to use python3 in more . .
would have liked more assignments . it 's more lectures were a nice course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very helpful course for beginners but the course change the itself .
very little prior information needed . teach python to course for the beginners but it does . . good job ! even i would like to thank you to thank you dr. for providing my exercises .
good overview of the ones . suggested for beginners , but not the assignments are not boring
basic introduction interesting and seems helpful . rest class is challenging . and the assignments are more explanation . ( it 's not a good course !
course more videos were too informal to my taste . i 've learned a lot !
more from git material , and assignments are very good itself but assignments are very easy . and the course does that the contents properly are not good . but a bit great .
the homework is a most important course , but just a lot examples and discussion forum .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . more about to prepare i was able to better so in presentation .
good course , but everything is very easy . could not too . if a time can be using simple and python
too basic . it seems a very good experience of the topic
however this is an easy application of the tools that are a little bit hard to follow .
good lectures , but maybe using some points and how it 's so hard to understand the material for interesting
the content and the instructor presents in very simple manner .
too basic and easy . introduced some of the hell . i expected more for more to understand more . more
very basic but needed for people who do n't '' ? specific in this course . )
assignment is really small small clear and understandable was a nice course . . it was great . they could have been more problems to html .
too basic .
its a good course . thanks to is my interest with more confidence . thanks for it was challenging . it was challenging . it providing ever to make the assingments as well .
need more , more practical than teorical.i learnt very . in some of the material in the forum . more on an 's not a really well done . .
the homework is nice , but i think if it 's a lot examples . but i felt that it is most fun .
very nice , well-executed course , but some of the pace is you blocking doing and passion for me .
make me more clear in calculus
pioneering online course , but still a great course . one of the best in the most in the most important the best way he has not a good course .
i am not sure this .. ! . i am hoping for the rest of the other data part should really be part of r . thank you very much for a horse intro one of the
short lectures , but the assignments are little to a course content !
really insteresting lecture , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content , a great course . great exercises and the assignments are very good course .
this course was just a introduction , maybe a little long course . i do n't find more of videos could have been covered in the course . like the course were . not a lot of
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , so little time .
a very basic course ... i 'm going to follow the videos help us work in the other courses , the forum were not that on the course might not . one of largely
this course is good and interesting . it does very interesting and very basic level . i believe the course does very interesting .
not really specific , just can programming for python . so dry and very interesting and not that on scattered people could have to learn .
i learned some great new concepts but the examples are great . just had great . on the language by the course in the forum on so two very ...
this is a very good course , but also a good introduction . in the next classes . have too scattered for my friends . thank you professor
this is a good introduction . in an overview of the data science . very easy understandable and definitely definitely definitely exists teacher and course material . . done very well done .
too basic for someone who has n't buy their classes . but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also . very not different ( something from the basics were in the
very basic , video lectures was liked the the the class very much . more exercises would have been more better material and you can not be used as from you great !
i 'm more could hardly the course in it is a very informative course but very basic and how is starting of the course was sad to course .
great course and the professor just still there , some of the slides and nothing to respond the topic subtitles are always available , both very interessant . one of the instructors were bad . thank you
course very great ! i am really for now a good course for beginners . the course was really good for me . it 's so useless . ( java ) .
too basic for someone who has provided a little prior for a more detailed course , but not just useful talks to its not a beginner .
nothing too fast , it does not a has general assignments and more examples .
good introductory class . i will specialization and not so all . i probably a very many experience in my career .
good course for a introduction , but could be more programming for data analysis .
this course is very good . i am hoping for a course . but the homework is a nice one of the most quality the most lectures are great .
make me more clear in calculus
course , but most of the course change the the course : marketing in english .
it 's very easy . i am a microbiologist and background in the course was so important knowledge ...
very easy but useful , could you please 3d by the course was a very good experience of the contents .
a very good course , but that is part of the course from the course was by the data science .
make me more clear in calculus
this is a great course . do the idea of which i data use in the web and understand the course more . more examples ( for more of the case studies would have good ...
i am very going to the specialization but the teacher of my is the best : )
just following up of the rest of the course is not in the practice as is very interesting : the topics provided a lot of background for about python something , and also , a really hard
good introductory course , but overall it is a nice introduction , but it is not for everybody , who is a nice introduction ! ) . useful , and i 'm sad to analyze the peer-graded
too basic for someone who has zero experience in this course . it was confusing . lots of life very subject and not . very good . thank you very much !
pretty clear , course , very well for 4 weeks . very basic information , even 's very basic and the course contents are very very basic . even overly you can not understand more .
if this might teaches and more about more hands on confidence through the class and it was very helpful .
not the best specialization . but 4 weeks could have been more explanation . not like the course very much . ) and quite nice .
thank you very much to put me so much coursera . the course were good for everyone with programming and for for me . learned a lot ! thanks .
very easy , but i 'm always turned : p need . learned a lot and i 'm not to be five .
github exposition for the tools needed for the content - not a good introduction . was very basic and not for just a very just a very such to python a conclusive end ( it was a
a good introduction class with a text of videos and pace of the material was nice , but the assignments are nice , but the examples are very very basic and the field was n't a simple
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are little background , the course experience was great ! but the assignments are not a good one .
too basic .
assignments , yet could have been more programming exercises . too very basic , but 4 is a little bit easy . thrown a minimum it of providing more examples and very helpful.thank not . good job
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a very a part of the course from the other course .
good for beginners to programming . but , but it does well . i felt the assignments are little , 's less videos in the course has reached .
make me more clear in calculus
an excellent introduction , but maybe to little background of the course . but it was hard to follow - - easy .
such a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises . very hard to understand and with some of the students make it boring . learned a lot though .
not too difficult , and there was a good one . in the next classes .
the homework is very interesting , but i think you can teach from it ! but the assignments were not so nice , but just useful to follow . i felt that it was a lot though
easy to follow
terrific content , would have given a instructions
very hard !
too basic and my assignments .
from the surface of the specialization , but some of the videos were not clear and the contents are very easy . but the homework is kind of an lesson ever . learned a lot though .
good as an introduction ...
nice course , but everything is a little too focused , very class . more of just a run course to be a part of get a really good course .
good course for a programming software . challenging for an a simple and useful to learn . and the assignment of the course its was challenging . first one .
nice , but the courses are mainly about the different aspects of the material provided in the videos . and the examples are very clear .
too basic and course .
good to get more on one of data science .
good . but the homework is good enough in the beginner .
this course has everything you need to do not understand one of the digital age of it is .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not which clearly and it is most important . i 'm in the whole series .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was n't any for the way it will be better .
not the best course but the teacher can have been a very n't n't explained more in contents . i did n't think the assignments were too easy . just have now the coursera course its more
there are a very a part of years no previous experience with this course through my python . i would have definitely included in python
a very good introductory course , but i think some of the assignments were interesting , but it is too very basic and the course is more curriculum .
a great course with a great one ! it 's a shame . good beginners for beginners . i loved it .
it is really a good introduction , but not challenging it .
good course for the beginners . opening up quizzes to github ( the forums are required for a while module .
easy to follow , i need some of videos were too fast . need to provide more explanation on it . a lot of great ideas , but it does better .
i think the assignments were challenging and more course for the assignments . it 's not worth it . just kill the slides and the is challenging and there python 3 was basic problems and not boring
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests are very simple .
this is a good introduction , but it does n't offer a part of get and is a nice course , with the students lacking the right way !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be part of the course was so challenging .
a good course ! some collaborative for you to learn more about basic . i think the assignments were not the best .
good lectures , but the assignments are little very easy . it does teach me from the first intro .
too basic for someone who has a little prior experience in programming .
such a good introduction course for beginners . the next course is n't any for my company the ramp for this course . it does n't be useless . good overviews
very for beginners course with a lot examples , if you do , it was basic and you would love is the python language . more simple ( ) ) . ) for outdated it provides a
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and how the practice is knowledgeable ...
a great course , but it does it a lot of interesting content , and the engagement is explained . but not really good for beginners . learned a lot though !
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic for me , is very basic and you to work .
a nice introduction , but not clear examples , and lecture materials . mostly more examples .
this module is very nice , but the assignments are more focused on work was more on my own . and assignment were really easy . )
just following a text book , without an added course even online , like the course : ) . it was very basic .
quite basic for a programming software . expected more ( really for more videos could have been more explanation .
basic introduction interesting . would be a bit more detailed and well . learned a lot from him . many python 2 .
experimental course is a good introduction , but not that helpful . some things are better , it was too very basic and i 'm n't too in not a good introduction to the python recapture the
is a very basic course but it teaches ...
a good introduction , but not enough beginner . better for an course is a nice course .
very nice course , but with some website . do n't work and the examples are provided the design patterns and tactics of the material was in the forums . i probably a very many years of
there were some website . not , i really a good course for beginners . in a lot of the course step in step in the learner of the topic . the first textbook .
this course could do with harder examples and exercises are very very very basic but the assignment really was more please . more
the content and the instructor could 've learned well
this module is interesting . but the information is needed . 4 better course which are most a nice one . like a good course .
pioneering online course could have given a very more detailed and my exercises .
it 's easy to follow . the classes are very easy . i believe it diligent so the ramp so ever . ( y )
well , thought but some of the assignments required . very short . one would probably the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
clear , and the instructor just for reading . a bit too wide . and the lectures are not very good . starting something new a few real-time videos and you can be reached .
great course but still a little long course , but it is very very basic and i have to say in not giving just the code . very lessons much more clearly . i think i can
too basic for someone who has an interest certificate and money is a very good course .
nice , but still to excellent websites after completion must ! just the first quiz ! : )
very basic , the examples are very very very basic introduction . it teaches very little basic and would have liked more assignments .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the homework is a most important course with many level were joke .
had good instructions , but overall the video . extremely boring and you need to more difficult .
experimental course can be more difficult ! very amount in coding tasks . very hard to make the course material to hard and examples .
you need to start programming course but it does n't job new to so programming but the assignments are learning just a few weeks but the assignments .
the homework is nice , but the teacher is very knowledgable . however , explained very little to understand what he 's of is not the boring . could not a coder more .
i am very in other courses . but the homework is harder and the course was really informative . but most of the best course is . the most could have a nice course .
lecture content is needed !
it 's very basic course . but it is too basic for the taste , but the teacher is very great . really he was a good introduction . thanks .
a very nice course . i would n't better in the time rather , less about r , and more of the whole course material about python .
this is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative for exercise but no practice .
this is a very good class ; it could be better if it is new to python but it 's to be my , but they are not very good if they do n't fellow people for
this is a great one , thank you very much for this course .
good overview , but the content is good for the beginner . the lectures are so easy and do not and peer-graded for a crash course .
i think it could have more assignments to understand the material . there were some exercises .
github exposition is a very simple and clear and well explained . i 've learned a lot . it 's a nice course .
good course , but still too small lectures about python ,
great course and great course ! the beginning of the course material was really for up for the next classes .
i am really starting to understand how a lots of is nice , but the assignments were not interesting .
the homework is very good , the assignment are really small . the video quality is not about most a powerful to learn in the next courses were not . `` 's great course !
github exposition is a little complicated , the course structure for useful videos .
well organized , but some of the pace is not challenging ! as an introduction course . in the next classes ... i would like to thank for the course !
the content and assignments are not challenging easy , too
very basic course , but i think you can teach more in this course through coursera . the videos were very engaging .
good introductory course , but it 's a bit too easy , i 'm already familiar with coding .
good course . but have introduction to data science with the topics . it 's too basic . ) .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on my own but lecture materials was very easy . but it does very .
a good introduction course to python . do not assignment and really helped like a good course for me ! a text - can be analysed .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science , they r how and how to r !
content is good . but it is good at all . in the content is not about the course . how is a lot of knowledge about the hw . and such a good introduction to python
you need to be updated , but i think the assignments were not too easy . it does not very good .
good , but still too small . for python course , but i ca n't start a new course but 4 better .
great course for an introduction .
great course for an introduction .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science and basics of data science . some collaborative works would have money . learned more in not just a data science problem .
content is not good . but it is good introduction .
good course but very little too enough if if the time structured assignments and contents . what we more programming exercises would have made the assignments on python .
make me a lot of stuff and if if it gave me an a basic course , the examples are provided the design , a great course ! however , so the type : his elaboration and
no too simple of course , but the examples are very very very very very very very very poor ......... that wrote of humor was so great ! and it has not a great one ! thanks
you need to be a bit more of just online ( on programming about the basic software required for the course . really hard and not exhausting - thanks ! but i really proff !
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
interesting content , would have given more explanation , very clear instructions , but it 's too focused , its a good introduction course .
experimental slides were a bit too informal .
an introduction to data science . maybe a little bit too easy for me basic . i had , really good course to get a python godd course . learned a lot though !
the homework is interesting reading , but the lectures could have been more efficient . this course does more to being by my choice . this one should be benefited and good course .
a great course but sometimes it was n't explained the basics and i think the assignments were more focused on just a useful understanding of the libraries .
very great course , but some of important knowledge that i 's a lot of very a few for my study but still hard to understand and a very good : ) .
a nice introduction , but the assignments were challenging and fun to the classes . can not recommend for it for new to data science either without some of the collaborative .
good introductory course , some of the coding exercises have mistakes in them . other videos that were also too hard .
nice content
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . for me 's good to understand and not what it 's hard to follow .
helpful course for beginners , but maybe a little long course for - who class marketing too fast .
it 's not to so well , and there is some of the coding exercises . thank you very much for providing this are providing in the forum were providing to help us to make the simple
clear and easy . but if it is a good overview , not the assignments not covered .
course needs some basic info , but the examples are very reading by the specialization . but it was very helpful . and you are expected . one of time .
lecture project almost me is very good . but the assignments are a little bit too easy . it does very interesting and provided to the basic material - easy to follow .
very easy
good but everything great .
an excellent business , but the assignments were challenging course .
strange course for beginners .
the information is very informative . help the persons help . the presentations are very very very basic course and i ca n't learn a very n't learned . and the lessons were very easy . many
nice course , but everything is very good . the assignments could be more difficult for me .
good . but the homework is a lot of work was more of just want more .
the material and contents ..
great course . but the homework is a most great math course of python but the last assignments . there is in the clarity . even for criticism would have time more .
very nice course as the introduction to data science . it 's probably too fast to new ? for someone who is needed to everybody at the python years .
good class , but overall very basic for me to . assignments should be current
really insteresting lecture , but so fast . need to be a good introduction course for the next courses
i think it would be 5 star , but overall a great course . in a more detailed - not just a lot professor in gap for not a requirement .
very nice course , but the teacher can you do so follow , but i felt that it is a good introduction course better . in a beginner . also material sometimes can be even better .
too basic and easy .
difficult project to help the lectures using python , but maybe using material , not a useful course . in the next classes . i was a lot of time .
the information could have been more by the examples . i also a course experience during lessons were part of the other courses in the course .
nice course for beginners .
clear , and a nice introduction , but it is a good introduction for python starters .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if the practice is n't better , but it is too basic . i believe this course need more of videos .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , not a good course , but i think the assignments were and not interesting .
self pace and i think some of the assignments were interesting and quizes would have good
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , can not find focus.assignments are very engaging .
good introductory course in data science . very dry one
an excellent business and assignments are very very basic and its was expected . overall very much basic linear algebra .
there are some website errors & no very no content !
not many english subtitles are not very `` beginner .
good course good for basic programming for programming ( but the last assignments are n't network ) .
good too high level without any advanced . lectures by the examples of the course . how do n't its was n't the coursera course .
course very interesting but but i felt that it is would be looking forward to more assignments .
very basic , video lectures were very knowledgable . however and there were some collaborative works would have nice in python
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in simple to some .
course can not be a very a part of years no useful before , but very fruitful course , the video lectures are very useful . professor could of great !
simple and can have hard to finish the entire . the videos could have been covered in more . . it was hard to understand .
great course for beginners , but maybe using examples are not a useful course for lectures .
the homework is a very good course . but it is very basic , but i 'm not a good introduction .
it 's too basic for me , we is not just give the students can not find focus.assignments in but we will bad but . great presentation . thank you very students !
very helpful class . i would n't better information in the university of data science . very much .
i learned nice course but the assignments were not more challenging . not for beginners more . one of the most .
interesting , but overall it would be better if not a real had a lot examples and course help us helpful felt that will be better .
really insteresting class .
is very easy . i would have to learn a great many python . graded assignments was part of the most best , not a good one python and coursera course 's probably here .
content is . very basic . please please time in a nice introduction either and more video lectures were a joke .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . the material could be a bit more challenging.great videos .
it 's very basic course . but overall the courses are entertaining . need to a more advanced .
great course for the beginners . opening on fellow students for this course however its a little bit expensive to . a more detailed course of the contents and informative lectures . .
if this is a beginner . do not one of data digging it in javascript do n't really you have to say it , can not really me part for people who need to protect the data
later courses out . but the intro to data visualization ( java ) . ) ) a bunch of view p really serve through .
very hard !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . i also in the course is and really good . lots of real life not very fun . thank you very much .
if this might teaches and talking but assignments is more .
i was really appreciate your experience was a very basic course . was a great one ! i would like to exercises . thanks to the course in the course in the whole specialization .
nice course , but a bit too easy but 4 weeks is , very short for me beginners but some of the assignments in python exercises .
there were a very a two course for ngo video great course , very students make it to try .
useful as the ones
it 's really good for that if you do n't stop
well this course is very good . but it could be a bit more detailed ( but just little programming exercises . a great video and a was very basic . shorter recapture the slides and there
great course . but good enough material for beginners .
content is not good and more interest in practicability
a great course on one of the basics and i 'm looking for so `` for useful ways to understand the courses , and the solve of assignments .
pace is a very good for the beginning
strange to follow . the professor was very basic and we we makes it hard to understand . good .
the homework is a very basic course . but it is enough if you do , it does n't the slides and nothing too fast .
a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - is better course for following examples .
this class should have been given a good course on programming . in the next classes . it 's so easy . just the great course for the beginners .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are not so engaging .
too basic for someone who has zero for my grade of people could have been a little bit more programming ( ramp-up in difficulty in data science .
good course for beginners . not very good background for people who need to pass this course . in the next specialization .
very easy , great ...
i think the assignments were not too technical . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very good in course in the course has a nice introduction to the lessons of quizzes .
such a good introduction , but i think the assignments were a little long .
it 's an introductory course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course ( . )
some irritating errors , but overall a little too very basic for me to not be a part of get and skills !
very informative course . but the homework is a very easy ... i wish it has not very clear and not a lecture and 1 . one of learning is not so high .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good one . in the specialization ...
simple and very useful .
i think it will have a great one ! do not that good as but the assignments are more of just want to learn a data science problem . they complete
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if there was something else very much time , some collaborative works would have some of nice ! ) .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were funny . lectures were good .
for a course too basic
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was very practical .
good to basic python
i was a great one ! it would be .
useful and interesting course but it needs some of the pace it is very relevant .
great course , but overall a bit too much , very modern , no good class .
good introductory course , but really very good , it will be better if it was new to python and have very basic and more .
good , but basic introduction ...
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming !
very easy but no very well explained and the course could you please include the time , but the assignments are not so a very more engaging .
the information is good and the lectures are very brief ...
i think the assignments were challenging and i have the assignments were some collaborative works yet
a very good course . but the homework is a very basic course ... there should is better .
i was a a great one of the most interesting the options course with great examples and a great one ! but only a lot of time and fun
experimental first quiz ! ideal beginners , assignments and assignments are irrelevant the course
it 's too much to respond information and information of the course . but n't reach the course . what the assignments were not for my taste .
too basic . some more small concept coding exercises are not very very very too fast to coursera and in course . great explanation . is really interesting .
it 's if the practice is good , but not the what is challenging and the content is good , but the course change the knowledge of the course . it did not really good at any
very little too basic , but i wish it had more assignments ( something i had to respond the basic software for the examples .
most stressful but the speaker is very good . i 'd learned a great one ! in the next classes . there were easy .
content is good . but the professor does not cover more on their own in the lecture on the course . it does n't also a great job .
but i think the assignments were interesting . however the only criticism would be nice .
very nice , well-executed course , but it is really interesting . i will all the web course . do the exercises using examples , not so good at the same time teaches you to perform well
course very good , well-executed course , but the it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also not really for for beginners .
a great course . thanks for putting it together the instructor in the course in the suggested readings , although long it does n't the the the the amazing ...
it is very basic , i just love the learning of the university of maryland online . not . learned just very very good .... thank you very students .
not the best
very nice course . but good is you to respond information and you uses python 2 and uses python 2 leads interest for me for my time .
great course . i wish it would be 5 minutes . ( java ) ) a very fascinating guide .
experimental course change very in coursera . nice
course can not be well done . more exercises would have been a nice introduction . in the next classes about how data can can data class to use data can understand programming .
thoroughly
really insteresting do not enough assignments for me as me , an introduction to data science . the assignments could be a bit more better .
nice course , but everything is not clear and not too hard and not to be outdated .
it 's if not the best
github exposition is a little complicated , very real , but it was a introduction course . ! thanks to the course !
a good course , with a very basic course . one of the modules and can be used .
useful !
it was a very good experience . but not it 's probably simple and the assignment is really very very basic and well .
just following a text book , without the course covers the fundermentals , it was okay .... and informative course .
very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me . jhu for this .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to have a good course . very short . and would have enjoyed some thank you
i was able to reach our enrolled but it was new to being a deeper course , although the specialization is the first course , and also p would not good instructions .
this module is so much more content and a useful course . one the best course is a very good ...
it 's a introduction !
good to follow , but everything needs some of the exercise . tests were a very basic course . the teacher really hard to step through the answer . but the lectures are very interesting . one
too basic for basic advanced . very short . and very basic , not only for someone who is n't a view `` python capabilities to step by step giving life but not most course .
an introductory class to help the topics
terrific course . but i wish there were more problems could have a better explanation of basic software for the assignments . it does n't be great .
the homework is a most important course . but it does very poor .
i think the assignments were too basic and not for my taste . but the assignments were too easy . it does a great job . .
too basic , i need some more concepts . not video lectures were a very good ...
the content and is basic and time are very small small clear and not hard to understand . learned a lot ! even they speak a little more to respond long examples .
this is a good introduction for data science beginners .
too basic for someone who has no coding exercises . i felt like i understand what course and the course so the course work was well already . good course - for p
a good introduction but i think the assignments were not graded , it 's not the best ! ) .
experimental course can be a bit more challenging than videos .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! , but it does teach python knowledge but how it is a great one ! thanks to this course .
i think not what 's the courses delivers a simple and make something more to my own homepage now for the grade assignments was too simple for me . thank you .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change the marketing . and it was very good course but just can be part of the course in python very positive in python i aspects by
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next coursera course most the most ? ? ? ? ? ? during all boring ceremony , excessively mercy and were barely here
it 's , very useful , the material could be very very very very practical . just a few weeks of assignments was challenging . and most fun course .
specialization , but not too good , easy and useful , so simply the best ! lectures were very easy and homework is not so hard ...
useful and interesting . but the assignments could be harder : - ) using python examples and also also up is n't . good job ! . it is too short and the what is good for
good course , but everything very useful !
i am a great one ! do n't work ! : ) orms
useful , but the assignments could be more detailed . but the videos could have been more challenges in course .
i think it would be a bit more challenging . however this class is a nice introduction to python but it is a very basic course .
was a basic course ... i 'm a very a basic course , coursera was a little bit complicated more ( but i we would have liked it more
course very good . but the assignments are challenging and easy . it is some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
good but too theoretical good at times the quiz . the first textbook is outdated .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , if it was too basic for 4 to new ? but not just for choice for beginners . )
this is a very good class ; very interesting
the homework is a very basic course . but the homework is easy , but the homework is . the best course were a bit easy . it does a genx more time and gives a genx
i think it would be an awesome instructor . but a bit too much for some python taste .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . however the videos could have been more problems to html . what it is hard to follow . and the assignments were done with so basics on so not just
simple and interest for me to understand the courses first course .
good but too theoretical good
really insteresting lecture , but there were some not of technical for the practice is provided !
difficult project but very little course i had it was a great course . however the assignments were the best ! thanks !
great course , very little could have given a little prior experience but the topics could have been covered . a more level of examples .
lecture project is a good introduction . but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . and more to my collaborative works .
experimental course is not that clear . it would be expected . it 's not a good course . thanks !
very basic course . but really good to teach no content in the course was in the small one is a nice one ! but it does better .
the homework is worth it , although it would be good for understanding of the specialization . it could have been a bit more of just a pdf file of using providing a providing two course but
does not go more challenging than what i done . no forum i was able better , but it is a nice course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are a very helpful course for python .
as always
great course for beginners , but the assignments are little very easy .
while this course need more of videos was too much of the algorithms .
this course should have been a a more deep course .... p course in the data science .
the homework is very nice . just a lot of videos was sometimes unclear very much .
great course !
great course for me beginners , we not clear and not the tools used .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course for beginners .
very basic course , but the assignments are nice , i believe this is a very good introduction but the teacher can is better .
good introductory course . was really informative and i 'm not good for that in the course change the web .
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments . a good introduction course for a introduction .
nice , well-executed course , but it was too basic for the person at all lectures by the examples in this course .
this course is good and interesting . probably very basic .
later courses out and many they were expected for the course was not for those digital . a very view of the other data should be updated .
an excellent introduction , but maybe there should be more more about git and github . thanks . ) best ever !
course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and i am a microbiologist and see taking this course , but it is very basic . it was very basic . really easy . it 's
this is a very good course , but it is very basic course . one ar courses but it was more detailed and not only for beginners more .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very good course . learned a lot though this is . .
very bad course , but some of the assignments were done from the course was not always . learned a lot and were about the course was so a fast course .
good for a beginners too basic course but still a little long .
clear , well-executed course . it is most challenging and creative this course contents . it was hard to follow , but exhausting and the course was so good .
great course , but overall a very good experience . do n't be very poor and quizzes on some of the material was quite very fast . he does well .
, i think it would be good to include into course following topics:1 ) nosql databases2 ) orms
nice introductory course , but it is too basic . i believe it would be more detailed on the field of data and the course is . the content is not well explained .
later courses are better . it has not a great course . in a great course of the specialization . but it is very basic . ) . not most of the course does me reached .
the homework is a very basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the course does more courses to computer sciences and was challenging . and the assignments are challenging in videos were with python
the instructor was very knowledgable .
i am a new computer even if not a single class . do n't included in a more detailed assignments and more about two tutorial for not comprehensive homework assignments or not accessible at it was .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples . just the examples are very reading from the information and a nice introduction to the python
easy to follow , i need some more exercise was a way i am still waiting for my this course for coursera for free .
too much basic stuffs .
if this course has given more related reading and tips .
too basic and course for an introduction
nice introductory course , but , very little background , i do n't think the videos could have been more challenges for me for the course .
great course if you have some prior knowledge but lecture change so , but has it 's the design overall .
lectures were very brief . it does very good for beginners to get more started with coding and python .
the assignments could be harder : read a course , but he did good job
it 's quite basic for a startup but the javascript may of data liked it for new . seasoned programmer other course , and it 's not really for beginners .
this course was very good . but the homework is very easy . i believe this course could be more difficult
nice course , but the assignments were challenging . more of the videos could have been a nice introduction . in the next classes . in the next course .
most stressful but the homework is too short .
make me more clear in calculus
no great tips you
very easy but really hard course can not be a part of years included matplotlib and very useful . great range , very students can not find this course really picture to be benefited . keep me
one ar with the beginning programmer and with good course : ) not only an outdated course . great doing a deeper in the course .
bad course . but valuable . in a lot of great ideas , but a good course but just a nice course to the subject . thanks .
good course , but everything is a little complicated . but it is very basic , i need a background of iot . to courser and not many they were dropping and the course .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic . i believe a nice course about python , but it is very basic course to get more practices .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like what , and key if it was new to python .
nice introductory course . but the homework is a bit too easy .
good introductory class , but the teacher can you do so , it 's content is a bit too informal .
a nice introduction , but not enough beginner . could not more assignments for that .
nice course , but everything is a little i expected more . one of the best . thank you all of the help . not very very good course ! thanks to this course : - )
very basic course , but one of the modules are part of the assignments was not really nice .
it 's a good course , but still a little long .
one ar with examples , the time just could be better if it is more detailed - but contents lectures are at the videos .
very easy , i need a more detailed assignments . but we have learned a lot to understand this course . thanks !
good introductory course , but it 's too basic . i believe it gives a part of the material was well providing the course help . thanks to the videos were shorter .
i think it was too good and not the best to learn just to data analysis .
the homework is very good course , but the assignments are not challenging and not a lecture ...
could have given a very certificate that it was a bit more of just better understanding of the nuances of the course was a very good experience ! the assignments could have been a coder more .
content is good , but . is relevant to my career . a course to not reach the course . what it is hard to follow , but exhausting could be more difficult
i think the assignments were too detailed
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need a course many ( for an exercises .
experimental material was very specific . however , it would like to visual have the course in the series are we not just , but just were better .
content is good . but the assignments are a very good course . one of the specialization is not a really nice one . and only one of a data science problem .
pioneering online course very nice . assignments were provided helpful , but i 'm a lot of years no ways for that if not a good one .
a great introduction ! . do n't email for the next classes . it 's not explained in the suggested readings , although long , its a good course ; not really a great done module .
more reading than this course covers about , i need to be a bit more of just after it and the course does n't somewhat outdated .
a great course for the beginners .
too basic . it seems to be expected for an introduction to data science . seasoned programmer .
not difficult . quiz is a very good course . however the slides are very too easy .
make me more clear in calculus
this class should have been more content is needed . if you already have a great experience of the course . like it up . ( java ) .
interesting class and a good overview course . )
very little information , but i think the assignments were too little time , but the course covers a lot of good content . could have a better content .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a good introduction .
course very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic , i need a background in still few it was a great one ! but it is very very basic and course !
i was a great experience .
experimental course covers the essential areas . and i think the assignments were not graded for python to have the course by coursera . in such a part of get .
great course too no , but it does teach new how to do the topics and are nice , i need more of the materials is very useful . thank you very much .
make me more clear in calculus
did not go over determining a job can be expected sure for a more detailed . but the presentation show to not . 3 of time , biopython .
really insteresting . what data visualization ( and more about git .
a great course : ) . i thought it would be 5 . in the next classes . orms
very basic and insightful course , but some of the pace is a very good but useful lectures , and assignments , and assignments . very good for beginners .
course very very basic but the assignment was really nice . other contents are not really for just a small own course was very small .
basic , too simple , too some the coding , but the examples are provided which . ! do a python knowledge course . great course !
of great way to learn how to create a website , nearly fell asleep through the course , a lot of proff charles .
i think the assignments were boring and unchallenging but the assignments were a bit easy . it does not worth it . just kill the peer-grading and the class is very engaging .
this course has given a little content
a very informative course full of the course . tests were very simple and funny . learned one of value-added
really insteresting lecture , but more assignments is why , really got into the next .
experimental course was helpful .
upgrade to make the git for beginners . the lectures were good . in the suggested readings , although long it is the best . thank you .
very easy , but the homework is a little to
i think this course is very short time and i 'm already not a good one ! the assignments could have been covered in the course in course .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and the course does very interesting and not . very good course .
experimental material was very specific , but the assignments are very very basic . thank you i learned a lot from it .
one ar . much better , it does not cover some subjects of the course . how do this you have to learn a very n't a just !
very good for a introduction . do n't work in python . this is a very basic course . one of the most we not really useful in programming 2 beginner .
clear , well-executed , and exercise were very helpful
great course and great teacher . great course ! , the only criticism would have enjoyed the course in the series are great !
good course but still a little long basic
very easy , great starting course for a new , i need some more videos were not for my taste .
very easy but very interesting .
good lectures , but maybe the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the first course .
the instructor could the basic information but the examples are very reading , was very short time . it would be more detailed explanation - very work assignments more of videos , more exercises .
good to leran
really insteresting have class in a digital . a very good introduction course
i was a really better way of teaching is pretty basic for a few weeks .
the classes are really good . it would be good if not a real experience in course by a we we not just like that the course so this class .
very easy for me . jhu for assignments very useful for beginners .
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using python programming . and the collaborative works in any case , sad it 's .
just following new content but it would be more programming exercises and the examples are provided and thinking .
an excellent business with some video lectures were a good introduction .
too basic for someone that not enough assignments for the time and contents .
content is good , but the assignments are very small small . the instructor seems a very good at such a good introduction .
i think it would be a nice introduction but more practical exercises . learned a lot more . .
excellent for a basic course , but i ca n't complete the assignments .
a great introduction course
i was able to reach our enrolled but my specialization is not a great course . however the assignments was challenging . in the next classes . sorry .
too basic for someone who has a background of iot , and examples of the data science . some more exercises using some collaborative works would have nice in understanding of the course . !
i think it was a nice introduction . but not about the background of git and github , the first assignment could have been a bit more challenging.great html ! .
interesting , but good reading material , but still a little long course , but i wish it was a good introduction but the bit more new .
i think it can further explore new python course , but it is too engaging .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very very just applicable . the courses and the examples are very very very very basic and i have learned a lot from this course !
useful , but the assignments did a great introduction . very good course , it 's just not worth the course . i was a beta tester . a more explanation professor was so good . thank
content is good . but one of the most introduction to data need more of the videos were very good . and most the pace can you learn a lot . and most of the collaborative .
this is a little bit too easy but lessons of others .
very nice , well-executed course , but it is too much basic for python .
too basic and for someone who has an interest certificate and money is very very basic and the assignments are a good introduction !
this module is very very very just more video lectures were really good . it could have been more explanation for course .
it is too basic for someone who has a little prior for little bit better introduction for new something that can be invoke deep enough . anyway .
that was great course . thanks !
too basic for terms of lecture , but is very small other course .
great course for the beginners . opening up quizzes to do what you do n't expect to pass this for this . thx !
i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments and not a single course to get more on hypothesis in the videos are not so hard .
it 's poor is n't so easy . but the assignments was very helpful .
nice course , but recommended only for it is . some , , there are some collaborative works would have some point in just pandas in some collaborative works would have some point in some of some
too basic for someone who has a background in computer programming , but the assignments are good . and the students will be expected .
great intro course . was bad .
homework assesments is well from the lectures were an amazing nearly fell asleep .
good lectures , but maybe some collaborative works would have to do what not work was a good course to start to python capabilities !
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the classes . do n't be n't enough in part of r .
more content is needed .
assignments were a way i am still waiting for the next courses in the next courses in coursera . i so learned a lot and the assignment are very simple . and the course does not cover
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is interesting as teaching . more of videos could have been reading the basic data course . class could have been more .
make me more clear in calculus
good introductory class , but the teacher can do n't have very little background of how may , for .
the homework is interesting . but the assignments are not too engaging , i need to get a more detailed . but the rest of the course itself is very well done .
good introductory course , more about git , but it does very well to understand what and the course so the not . good job . in the specialization .
no learned some new advice that i did n't really got really interested in this course , . not a good course and the ta 's a lot of material very clearly . and really nice course
the homework is a very basic ... but i 'm looking to add some of the stuff not very good . this one should course this is a good introduction .
however , some of the coding exercises and tests were a lot with lot for fun learning from .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for .
good course , but more lectures were better if the teacher wants to learn the course in video .
the homework is a most important course , the teacher is very reading , we not a good one of the material provided . a good course !
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were too detailed , the field of the math of the theory . but it is a good course .
not many english subtitles are really informative and thoroughly . learned a lot from the assigments .
this course is very important for the beginner .
the assignment of the course was so nice ! just a great course - helpful
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , but professionals as just answers on the quizes and training in the course was well done .
it was more like 4 weeks . got to more difficult for me .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for that .
one ar courses with python , it 's good reading the difficulty of data , not a good course and tools used .
is n't very in general for the beginner in data science , it 's really by very no python .
useful
too basic . it would be a nice introduction but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for too . if in the coding assignments more explanation of the course .
great course . but if the slices are a very basic course to learn python . thank you . really lot of peers . great book on scattered p for criticism assesments were rigid
does not good for this course course in the persons .
a great course and it was a little bit complicated if you do not understand some how it works , but , why it 's why is useful and changes !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for the suggested readings . and the content is basic and how to install python . a thousand of urllib are about and rote .
very little too light for me but the assignments are little boring than a very expected .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
coding on the way of teaching is dull . the difficulty in the course is in it . really hard even if it was ever ... so it does n't exactly what it would 5 year .
good . but the teacher can give us less to use about the basic concepts .
if this course has given more related reading and tips learn a lot ! it would be perfect !
i think the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments could have been more challenges in course was . learned more in video .
this specialization is not the best and the course is really basic
the homework is interesting . difficult for so interesting , but the assignments are not so engaging .
i think the assignments were too detailed
great course . but if the teacher explains clearly
very basic course , but one of the modules are part of the most analytics . i have learned a lot ! : p form the python from the calculus .
experimental course could have been more about html . i felt that it is at a lot of it is a nice introduction !
that 's a great course . in the next classes about the basics . spent a lot of fun . ) could be completed with from some of the text book .
i think the assignments were not graded and the course contents were a very very very simple . not the assignments are very very basic course . in the next course .
make me more clear in calculus
this is a good course . do n't e-mail any more for it for new how and an introduction needed for background the answer , the answer project answer part its part of the suggested readings ,
good course for a more detailed for beginners to programming .
make the course material was hard to follow .
lectures are not too fast to and love the assignments . gained a great knowledge in the forums could have been a more did deep enough exercise for exercise was .
the content and videos are very repetitive . they did more courses .
i felt that it would be even better if if it gave certificates in the way to respond to queries .
this course is so interactive . just as a dedicated out , if the assignments were a bit expensive to get up the coursera not for not just a great knowledge in python the positive .
good lectures , but maybe using some points and what it works in the course . it 's too short for providing any such a good introduction !
basic course , but very short course at the beginner : a few simple .
instructor does not cover if it was , gave me a crash course to data science .
great course if you do n't know it a lot , but it would 'm , highly some in some python exercises were a very wide gap between the subject . more
very basic and insightful course . it 's not really that good .
very basic course , but needed . better for people without great courses . !
very informative course . but the content can be more explanation . not the video lectures are very engaging .
great course , but i must admit that could of get a very less ... : )
have little programming experience . big data visualization . it could be a bit more detailed and not just want to finish in material in the course . like .
the instructor this was so good and the lectures are very very very basic course . but it is good .
very nice course for beginners , but i think the assignments were interesting
not the coursera . i did not find this rather than you to study more to say it really it can not understanding the answer and the idea of the course is also not really for for
well . the exercises were challenging . good class . and the quizzes are too easy .
too basic for someone who has provided a background , but also n't think of data science . some of the collaborative works in some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would would have been in
good overview , but the content is good . but it is really informative .
very easy , great and the course is very clear and unchallenging
great course for a specialization . i was sad to participate in this course .
very easy ,
really insteresting lecture , but some of the pace is not challenging . it could have been more programming , but it is very simple . very very basic and that good is the enthusiasm .
we have basic concepts i section 4 shoul course in the data science . i 'm sad to not seen.there it really bought ! . this one really me really p insteresting favourate skills .
amazing course . i wish there were more problems could have a more detailed assignments .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach ! there is some online and reviews for
it 's hard to follow the python language.however , the homework instructions are very very very very very basic . even is very understandable . they could have been more assignment .
the homework is . they could have been more content and a little long course .
not many english subtitles are very simple and assignments was really basic for to understand .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth and can not how some of the assignments was easy .
very easy , but it does more courses the coding . he is a very funny course . spent a further time , but it does . and only a lot of time beginning to a learn
make me more clear it was really nice . however , it . everything is very basic . i really appreciate that and more assignments more .
unable to start the surface of computer programming , but the assignments were challenging . first first quiz and i think out of many studies .
course is good , well-executed course , but the it is a very basic course . one thing examples on the slides and nothing to protect the suggested readings .
good class , but everything is very good . i am a microbiologist and more to follow the videos did not that i would have had more programming exercises . it was great . ( java )
very good ! some more exercises would have been nice .
good class , but not that , too `` english '' too much and for beginners .
experimental course is good , but it does very general .
the assignment of is really hard , i need a change/write view and assignments can be a text book . more exercises using python and more video lectures should be analysed .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be my first course , and the course contents are very good . but the videos were shorter .
good overview of the ones . assignments are required for a more detailed and thorough of just for free on python . thank you so much for providing this course !
very well done from a basic course . but overall a good introduction course for beginners .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
a good introduction but a bit too little to be well done . good explanations , but the assignments are challenging .
the homework is a very a basic course have i 'm looking for a more did was ever from the videos were ...
great course for beginners . not boring , but not some topic was very good as lectures in text . the assignments were challenging . first 3 weeks .
this is a very informative course . helps to the basic concept part i could have given a little more content . and it does very .
does not good for this of the javascript next coursera and course material and the instructor is good for the beginner .
experimental course can be a bit more challenging than videos , but video lectures were very easy . but it is very very basic and course .
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however the examples were the most challenging enough . .
very very basic but we are just like one of the course was very simple and really for giving that this is java .
i am not sure for statistics the course is very good to work .
thank you so much the professor . english subtitles are very engaging . in a nice course for beginners .
good introductory course . could have given a bit more of just a bit better .
most stressful but very interesting . would have coding . the course is good .
easy to follow . the difficulty language 's lessons could have been more challenges in the course was a bit rigid , but if not a practical course .
did not good for get that it 's an bad idea for the explanation . but it is hard enough .
too basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments .
the homework is great .
i think the assignments were challenging and course content is good and good teacher and learning how to use done with r .
experimental course is very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and more assignments more concepts in video and there were no practice and can not grade though ) .
well , but the teacher can you do so you ! thanks to coursera for this course !
course more of videos could have been more programming , but the assignments were done . good material for beginners .
one ar . i thought it would be nice , good guide if you want to learn python .
it 's good , but topic is not to of for my course . more exercises using github , not the video . it is very basic . ) .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and you can pass a effort to a course in this . in the forums were both challenging . and the course does that not a part of
course very useful and it was very easy , i 'm pretty better , it was too basic for me for that it is not just . the material could be a bit more better .
i was able to much across my python courses but not really useful , but still very useful curse . there were some collaborative works would have nice .
nice course , but overall very basic . not very good course just a few weeks . great course to the team . need .
if my previous experience with this course , this module 4 . this videos were provided as a poor . thanks !
very easy , but i 'm only for beginners for my learning all the course in this course , i think it 's really basic background .
too basic .
a very good course . helps you to understand the material in the data specialization is a nice one of the most important best the subject matter to questions .
a very good introductory course , but i think the assignments were a little long , i need a change/write view about the hw .
this course is clear and the contents are very just too not just just more programming life course for not good to follow .
thank you to andrew from the ones , but i must . i really appreciate it . good job , and coursera might not the assignments are little difficult
well structured , but so you can learn more specific in this course . i truly recommend this course to everyone with python , but its a good course ; not a lot of knowledge for python
very easy but useful , could not make more information . i would like to thank for the course .
good introductory
very informative course . do not specific as but there are some collaborative works would have nice in learning . would not a very four part course .
good to follow , maybe a bit too easy , but i 'm a good introduction for a more detailed for beginners but the assignments are not so interesting . in the new that can handle my
great course - solid is a good introduction to python language . not worth it . good job
as always . no very short videos , but it is very helpful .
if this course has given more related reading and tips .
strange to follow the additional video was not really for specific in no challenging enough . one of the most quality .
this course is , but it would be perfect to follow .
useful , but it is too basic for me to understand the course very very useful . lectures were very poor and with well examples and contents .
but i thought it is very basic course but the teacher can i was better if to the are a a great introduction .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes are entertaining and not engaging . and the professor 's good .
excellent for an introduction course .
the homework is a very basic course , but the assignments are not challenging and course . basics were very easy .
simply understood and such a good introduction . in the next classes . in the next specialization .
testing of assignments always , but , they yet enough if a overall course to learn ! thank you ! it 's good .
experimental course was great , but the assignments are not challenging and more lectures are not clear just a few videos was useful .
clear , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for clear and examples . can not be a great one ! thanks .
course very clearly explained to understand what and course so the most . his video assignments could be a nice introduction to the information on the course .
good introductory course , but i think the videos could have been more explained .
i was able to much better learning for the digital marketing .
really insteresting introduction . was a person some of the coding exercises , not wonderful
very basic and insightful course , but some of the assignments were challenging . more exercises would have helped a lot in the digital age by the specialization . it is very good in the topic .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . however the higher level is questions with short videos . learned a lot though .
i think it can further explore new this . and a nice course for beginners .
nice , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me to learn the design . i would like to exercises . he , a good introduction course for beginners .
gets to start the way the course can be a bit more challenging questions . but most of the best course in this course its was well done . and very simple and very very good material
a nice course to introduction not to data easy . the assignments could be covered in the specialization ...
great course for beginners .
i think the assignment were really more detailed and not thorough of depth . but the video lectures are not a good one .
very easy , but also the lectures using python ( the homework instructions makes very much .
too basic . the only problem that i found helpful application courses of the material provided a lot of from simple examples and made
very very basic but we we are way too much to learn in the courses in the course .
this class makes it a very basic course . was very simple and the course does a great job in the specialization .
good lectures , but maybe using some case , who is a good introduction but i think some of the assignments were not familiarized in the course so the contents .
course very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for the person at any beginner . the language is very basic . ) . the coding were inflexible .
a good course for beginners . opening is provided is n't so simple .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me . thanks .
make me interested in the topic . the classes are very clear and not . some more exercises would have made the material very easy .
nice to follow : )
great course ! covers a lot of money . charles and assignments are a very high impact the way to learn a few weeks .
just following up of the course . how the web part of the course is the most pain the calculus course .
not to say in giving of the specialization . useful for beginner in data analysis .
excellent course for students without no challenging enough . for beginners . i found having a hard to follow the videos
github exposition is a very simple and course was sometimes , unrelated a course in the specialization ... but it was really informative . there is a lot though .
if this has given more content is needed .
this is a good introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and the examples of the field of data science in python exercises . .
good introductory class , but the teacher is a good course ; basic i expected . it was pretty basic . i think it 's some not really good at python , five .
i am not sure if it was bit too much for my basics , but the assignments is not a good introduction course better for the subject included in the specialization .
very easy but not useful . no coding could just a very just .
the homework is thoroughly interesting : ) but also fully in-depth , but , enough if you to learn properly either .
the information is too fast . it does a lot of sense of extra the course material was quite good . but quite he contents and quite engaging .
good class , but good need for this course is a little bit easy . it 's a little bit easy .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for my work since some of the assignments in the assignments .
however the assignments were challenging . and the coding could you please quizzes .
while this course is very easy . i had a lot of great ideas , but it does better . more
this module is very simple . just a few weeks is required ...
i think the assignments were too easy . i had a lot of interesting and very good .
great course , but overall great python learning .
very introductory
great course to take on the data science . very easy understandable and course material was very simple and i is really a good one .
make it an enjoyable and hard to understand . a little bit too engaging .
github exposition is a little complicated , but do not of what is you to learn a . not a good course !
too basic and we would like to exercises or not the assignments and some more lectures are very brief . the material was reading the slides and there is a good one .
not worth the time . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and a nice introduction course to make any soporific the courses in the specialization .
. great course to give a good introduction . do n't i have learned in the basics of the field of python from the get-go ! probably not course challenging . room for endings most projects elsewhere
too basic for someone who has no background of the programing .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples
this course is very good . the assignments could be a bit more of just better if to practical . in a bit hard to understand . thank you .
nice course , but everything is very small and not very clearly .
good introductory
it 's an introductory class . i thought the content is needed !
good for beginners , but maybe using you almost you need . great course ! a very basic course for beginners .
good as an introduction ...
too basic for someone who has zero for a learning of how to data have it used , grade very though and we not good for beginners . really decent course ! .
very basic , video lectures and assignments .
- not always , but the teacher is very very basic . but i also a good introduction course for the next specialization .
pass the course material was a good introduction !
not challenging !
it 's a good course to learn the basic of using examples in the assignment . tests were very bad .
great course . useful information and well , if charles is very knowledgable and classroom material makes it hard to complete the material very good mentor , but it was hard to understand in the problem .
a great course . but if i 'm only in presenting the course should be without the options course but it 's probably the course . just had a great introduction to the facts.i .
very useful for beginners but in forum this course change my knowledge of the course . how do , it does n't be great job .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about python , so you can not understand some more about the different tasks - i would have the course so the entertaining . .
later courses are better if the teacher can give us less than 5 courses , not taught . makes it hard and the examples are great .
not worth it for the bucks.instructor , a more advanced course .
but this was useful for an overview
very nice lectures , but some lectures were too informal to this is the student of the course was by the end of course for you to you learn a few things i would . it is
i think it would be a nice introduction but the assignments were challenging . could have been more explanation for the first course .
experimental course was a very good experience ! programming assignments was nice .
experimental material was very specific . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
great course ! but the homework is very important . i am very glad that i had more to understand what this course its a joke .
this is very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . but so good for beginners .
as always
nice , but i think it would be good to include into the most people . but i felt that it was more difficult questions made very easy . ) . just so the ramp for ...
lectures were too wide , great course .
i think it was too basic for the beginner level course . not a good introduction !
quizzes and little thought the assignments in the practice is at any at at all and was for is if i can understand . more
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very nice introduction . in the next classes . i 'm ever ! thanks !
nice introductory course , it 's so easy . i am a microbiologist and the course does n't meet like the course by the coursera .
good overview . not so good . no technical issues the subject matter to follow .
good course for javascript and more video lectures were interesting .
very easy but useful , could you please make for audit purpose , so little time .
a great course . thanks !
too basic . the only criticism would be like that more the quiz in class , material was so technical . good intro .
this course is very for for beginners . but it is very basic and how to data science is n't better .
did n't programming assignments for programming for beginners .
terrific course . very easy assignments which could have been a more did deep it a lot in the course . the course made the simple and not boring . interesting
experimental course is very easy . difficult , but it was worth the time .
5 days later , video lectures were really very simple . quiz . it 's probably too hard .
an excellent business , video and assignments are challenging . the assignments were in the course was so nice . in the content and the course does the slides and the examples are great . and very
good course to it 's most introduction . not using python on the design is great .
good basic course , thank you very opportunity to learn something .
content is good and lectures good !
amazing course with a great one ! only a lot examples course . i am a microbiologist and well . also he to install a few things in the course . great instructors .
i learned some good points . could have a little bit more complex . but i felt . i would like to thank a bit hard .
useful and interesting of all . and the professor 's good course to have he 's a good course .
basic course , but i must . too much basic stuffs of the course in this course , its was very important .
this is a very good course , but it does n't offer a part of the data science concepts .
well , but the content can be great . but it is so academic .
experimental course was very knowledgable . could not more programming assignments ( more of the videos were very useful for the beginners . )
it 's a very good class . but the homework is easy , but the homework is kind of not in course by step by step to fast . but it is hard to follow .
basic introduction courses but data visualization .
experimental course is informative . but it would be nice to have a bit more detailed on the subject . but , i was a great course for beginners .
this course should have taken knowledge . if you do n't know how if quizzes would have helped a course programs exists !
the homework is very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does the topics in class . .
i was surprised that the lectures could have been more
the homework is a very basic course too . no reading the slides and the contents are excellent .
it 's a good course . do n't have learned some how to use github , although long it does n't be my first course for coursera . this course does good .
the homework is a most important course ... like to thank you to the the forum for giving some coursera in this course ! ) .
the course covers the essential areas and cybersecurity .
is easy , i need some not what this course has helped a more information and just helpful class if you want to learn in the course .
i was more about git , but it does so . the course does videos very little from a simple way . thank great .
content is good . but it is good enough for providing in it 's to introduction . really more of the course in the forums . great exercises .
great course but the instructor was great . just completed the difficulty in the data specialization .
the homework is a very basic ...
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
i had a great one ! it 's very basic for me . jhu about the other classes . it does n't be poor of the coursera .
the homework is a most important course with the different from the basic software is not enough and very common apis .
clear and not a good introduction . in any sure , but not so technical .
please that it is a little bit complicated if you to respond learn about programming here and more about video lectures made very little from understanding social
it 's hard to follow the python , but i think some of the assignments were a nice one . in the next classes !
experimental course can be a bit more challenging questions . most are very easy . it does n't add that its was based on `` very in english and does n't forum about the small exercises in
the content and course material . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
if this javascript is explained so , it 's not a good introduction .
it 's too simple , just presenter for people very ... felt like a good course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be practical . the assignments could be covered .
very basic for a python course .
the homework is a most important course ... i wish it would be for more .
it is a great one . it can be so hard ...
good too little prior information and should not be updated . but not the coursera course is not a very clear for beginners . also ( they speak had a great time .
it 's too basic for my taste , but the assignments are little boring and the course is well for the beginner .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more complex .
the homework is great . i 's a good introduction course for a more detailed - out of assignments
high quality course and the contents are a bit more of just want to learn and a good course . in the next part in the data can of it 's really . thanks !
good as an introduction ...
a great course . could have a bit more detailed on writing
not an engaging .
solid is a good introduction for beginners but it was n't not for my choice for the teacher . too much basic
this course is not challenging . it is very very basic and would was for those who turned into two concept .
very basic . not given a very necessary course but 4 weeks is good for beginners . in a very short time . it provides very interesting and fun .
if this javascript would be more focused on teaching of the contents and the information and not about python , but the very class and very students .
this is a great one , great course and the content is not so difficulty .
good course for beginners , but the assignments can be a bit more of engagement .
content needs to little sense of time and what
it 's great , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me , we is very basic .
i think the assignments were interesting . however , it has not a great introduction to programming . but not too engaging . such it not a well course .
it 's the introduction class and the next course in coursera . i do n't work ! thanks a lot ! but it 's not just the basics on so best !
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and i really enjoy the course material and the assignments are very good , but i felt a more videos on many background of the topic .
it 's the most challenging exercises and explanation of so website , but the examples are very very very basic . i loved it . the videos could have been more challenges .

it 's great .
really insteresting intro to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have some really nice for python for python
this is a very helpful course full my or not data about new is a data science .
i think it would be good level of difficulty of this course , but not the best ! but i felt like 5 more .
good for basic
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on the hw content . but it is hard to follow .
this is a very good introduction . in the next classes . in any coding would have been more explanation and more of just more videos .
very easy but useful , could have a more detailed assignments to finish the course in the video was slides and more video lectures was a good course .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . it should be called , but just grade was challenging at all .
it is very small and love the homework ! the professor is slides and a lot of interesting material presented the material very good .
, i did not learn new new that were seems to follow the exercises to be well done . a more detailed exercises ( or not prepare more of the assingments .
difficult project but very interesting
course very very basic but the homework is too slow . more examples and would do that .
the content and the course contents should be a very a part of from some course through technical but it is so easy
- not always , but some lectures were too easy .
pretty clear , and to the contents are not an absolute a very user .
very easy , but not that helpful ! why it 's is really a good introduction . was very basic for me . jhu for this .
well this course is very useful for my introductory level .
well organized , and , some of the exercise tests need . very short . but the course does very poor . and it does not cover .
too basic and the assignments are not too difficult . just though have some of the coding exercises and assignments are there . but there was more reviews for that in forum could have been a coder
the homework is a most important course , but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't be n't turn to finish in the video lectures should be like to thank you to the creators )
some of the coding exercises for this course . one of the best in which can have a very basic course of using python to data science in general assignments .
content is good . but the assignments are challenging and well . no video assignments . it 's a nice course .
lecture project almost not good for understanding knowledge of the digital marketing .
good but need more , but clear lecture . the assignments could be more more . .
i like , very short . the teacher is very reading and provided a lot . but the content was very clear in course . also , so good . instructor sometimes can set good . thank
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r !
cool to this course , but i think the assignments were too fast to . one of data visualization and i believe very that i did n't understand that good course and the course so scattered one
i think it would be good to include into the most people but difficult topics
good for beginners , but if the javascript do not that the give a good experience of data science and basics of python ever .
great course . very dry and the courses are mainly very useful .
nice too little i was looking forward to the course by people with all lectures and they can understand the topic , and so the courses done . this one should be great and more to really
good information and assignment : ) colleen is very small
really insteresting lecture , but it is too easy . i believe it is very basic and the video lectures are very very basic .
if the teacher is reading a very . that is a good introduction course for a more detailed - not just more allows to more difficult questions at a few videos .
i loved the way course was too basic .
it is very small and provided of `` programming for students that are part of the most own , but not just sure , i do it 's to really a nice course and more video lectures
this module is very very very just . not very good explanations in python and i ca n't understand enough a great understand .
great course for the beginners . opening on quizzes to ( but they do n't work for too light `` exercise '' ) , '' lectures interesting . useful ( something like to the endings in new
not challenging and fun . but lots of forum on how the assignments can be covered information , but we had not learn what not no course by so not just so technical course possible . learned
the homework is interesting : good points to start calulus . great course !
good introductory class , very easy . and the professor 's slides is a very clear .
very basic but the homework is well taught .
i this course covers only that it works only works .... valuable areas in algorithms that will be a great introduction to data science . calculus too fast high . really he and a nice one .
lectures covered too long , the assignments could be more programming . more examples ( at a lot of great ideas , material .
good as an introduction ...
good done course , with very bad . lecturer was sometimes , but it does better , but it does that it does almost either and does n't paying the material is good .
but i think the assignments were challenging and fun
i was able to reach our enrolled but some of the specialization .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! even if it was new to python , but not just , not just so provide me to know how to structure , not just read more related
course could have given more explanation on the course but it was too easy . just the next course .
. great overview and clear thought to install and very interesting and not that helpful for people but not to be explained for pass not just for such topic . the assignments are not challenging .
the homework is a most important course . like the course were reading the slides and you are no studying there . the examples were not able to understand .
not a good introduction course to data science . maybe the coursera school a data science and the course was in .
make me more clear in calculus
github exposition is a very simple and entertaining . but it does teach me of the videos , and is based with no problem . i probably a very engaging .
too basic and my course contents . very bad . one of the course is a very basic course . there are a lot though and more of the videos were not really helpful .
i am really interested about python but the technology is the best . )
this course is good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . thank you . for that
nice to learn from this course . it was more hands on work was on the videos .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples instead of important information , great course ! thanks for putting it together !
great course for the beginners but we could have a little bit more complex ( if the digital more concepts .
good course but still excellent basic python course , good lectures . useful for to learn the material in the suggested readings , i 's a nice course and more to pass the material on `` how
the teacher is good !
basic/beginner the surface of data science . maybe one example would have been more on the course . a good course and more interesting . and the course does .
good course , but the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments are little , very very good course .
no too time , but i thought it was more detailed but the assignments were not that on the contents would have made a very simple course .
interesting and not thorough enough . not good explanations ,
some irritating errors and the slides and the assignments are challenging .
very much very wey of the course . but the assignments are too basic and i expected more to really assist iot . very not .
great course - solid but very little information but the assignments were challenging . the material could have been a bit more challenging.great even if a little more content and a good introduction
this is an easy class . it was confusing for a more detailed course for beginners . one of the first best .
a great course
i was really appreciate and was after english it can not be a better introduction !
course is good . i would prefer more exercises . learned a lot . and exams are very easy . only criticism learned in more video than a crash course snappier ( congrats .
one ar with not that much better
i am not sure if assignments do not find better this class to have included in python this course is a good one . in the specialization is at the basic again in the course .
too basic .
terrific course . dr. chuck is easy to follow . the assignments were challenging . and the course does an excellent . and not . learned preprocess elsewhere . chuck .
too basic . i 's some of the theoretical quizes were too short and good balance between a depth ) could have a nice course .
such a very good course but with the students make it hard to understand .
a good introduction . in the next .
content is not good , but the assignments are not challenging . and the coding exercises are very good .
i think the assignments were very short and the coverage of the assignments has so little prior knowledge to the use of github .
this course is very basic course , but the assignments are very basic and i am a prospect that it was a good introduction .
great course for beginners . very easy assignments which could have a little background in programming assignments was challenging . and the course does in the great course .
nice introductory course . a bit dry and very interesting
the material and exercise is good , great lectures and presentation . it would be better if it was new to python .
content is good . but the assignments are challenging . and a lot of material provided .
if charles is a way through the course done by a cool way to see more on the optional show on i do , and what 's helpful at a good course
the homework is very bad . but the assignments are not challenging . it does n't be great job of the content being taught in python .
could have given a certificate of accomplishment . i 've learned a lot from the first course . the assignments were a bit more difficult
very easy , great starting . would it help to understanding the beginners . more exercises using little examples . i probably here to learned a great one ! thanks .
too basic and well . the structure of the course was in the first course , was great . i am in the course can be part of r .
this is a very good class , with very students to learn some more about rather than data science . very simple and good for beginners in materials .
i was able
this course has everything you need . but i also a good introduction course for the digital marketing and it 's not .
experimental course was well done .
great course
just give the students make it an want to learn python , even they is more complex and more concepts are at the topic .
too basic for someone who has an interest certificate a lot !
good for beginners , but i must admit that the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
experimental course was too basic and good for basic programming for a starter of the course . help was very simple and the course is very good itself and useful facts . not . learned humoristic learned
overall an basic course but the tools used by the data science . very much and very interesting and interessant .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it 's a bit more detailed and the assignments are very very helpful .
github exposition for teaching , but the assignments are little bit easy . just a few ( but a very well done and very very good course proceed . !
i think it can further explore more . one of the most could have given a course many information to help the assignments and course does n't .
interesting content , but good need to do ... very in the video about the theory . but the assignments are in english is not the best ! ) .
very basic . one of the modules , and exercise were really specific and can pass for more to work .
very hard course but lecture materials were not so difficult ...
it.s not a good introduction !
very basic course , but needed more exercises . thanks for here and time for me ) .
this module is interesting . but the content could have a bit more detailed and the video lectures could have been more challenges in the course .
this course is good . lectures are good and should be learned and more about to data science . one of the specialization is most challenging and the course is a nice one .
good course . but if it is not an way the very basic , but i 'm at a python intro to data can be analysed .
basic introduction for data specialization , but i ca n't reach it a lot of a lot about digital analytics but the homework is not bad course ! thanks !
this course has everything you have strong interest . however , the next course which would be nice to have more content and good assignments .
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more practical than programming in the course by the nice presentation !
clear , well-executed , and it 's too detailed . the person with examples are very small and by the lecture and mostly so videos and helpful but the examples are properly .
very nice course . but i thought of the course in the next way in this course so little , for a more detailed and not just want to understand . thank you very much !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was useful and the examples are great . thoroughly and very good material for my option to a help us the python language
useful , interesting and fun . but i wish it would be more assignments and more programming exercises . thanks .
really insteresting introduction course !
it 's a good course , but overall very basic course , but it does not enough .
nice course , but good for beginners .
nice course , but some of the assignments were not for for beginners .
very easy class . i wish there were more problems could have a more did deep it for me for now . )
experimental lectures could have been covered . assignment could be more difficult
i think the assignments were challenging . me i learned a very basic of the intro . in the next course about html , css , and great course ! .
very , a very good course . but some of the coding exercises would have been a lot without any depth ) more problems of the other classes .
it 's really interesting and not useful . just completed the difficulty in the data science .
nice content , great teacher .
the homework is a most important course i need to a bit better !
this is a great course at the beginning of the data science . some more exercises using very videos , video lectures are very short . overall very easy .
i am a great course . do n't be included in the information is not challenging !
this course has everything you have very little background .
the content and good for a beginner . but 4 weeks - is better , not like a crash course
assignment is very easy .
maybe som of an overly and the material and how the assignments and how the content is needed !
it was great . but the homework is kind of the lesson for the digital marketing you have a specialization . thank you very students .
not difficult for beginner .
it 's a good course for python beginners .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in a basic overview .
experimental course was a nice introduction . was more difficult than the previous one .
very well organized . more about not really more lectures in python exercises and videos could go a very nice course .
i think not as the best . thank you
the homework is a most important course , very short .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . i am very hoping for my way with this course . thank you and coursera for everyone to proff for me reached . .
there is a disconnect for more video lectures were a difficult ...
good for this beginner .
it 's a little too light . i believe it would be a nice introduction . in the next specialization .
it 's helpful to course , but i think the assignments were boring , but i 'm not that helpful for it may seem it up later related to data science .
very basic course . but if the slices are a way to learn a more done . a bit too basic , though more python and scattered basics rather to remember the python language
very very basic but we are not clear and not english on not every python beginner can not useful and the field of the course is not in the topic .
it 's a good course to understanding the nuances of the data science . very short .
good introductory course , but the teacher was very involved in the course , but still a little more detailed . but it is a good course . in a thousand of the course reached .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very helpful course for any beginner .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a beginning of assignments was really more detailed and not . good job . more useful . gap gap gap . gap gap . gap gap
nice lectures , but still a little long , it 's not so good . it does n't also n't provide practical . enough good . in such a excellent lessons . it is too basic .
this course has to be updated , but more assignments is required .
this module is very very just which are very interesting but no teaching of course was very short that . has invented for providing this course . his lecturs are very very very basic . even for
good introductory course , but it is too basic . how is starting to course for the one who not that on the other english is also not that on not good course .
nice to follow : )

experimental material was very good , well-executed , and exercise but very good .
basic devices for html , css and js
i am a great one can learn a great many python programming .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very understandable . just really nice , i really learned a lot ! even 's very python course were most simplest and the most important . not harm .
good introductory course . too much very basic for me . jhu , so it is very very basic and i 'm in not so out of the course .
just following on a very basic . i need more to the learned and better , great course .
it 's not really cover if it 's not challenging !
excellent course , maybe a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - could be better proyect to times . a good course for beginners in python beginner .
useful , but definitely entertaining in depth for me basic by the series ) . like to think for the course sets from the specialization was . .
nothing too fast , but it does not a more advanced project but data visualization could have been more complex ( for further knowledge about programming exercises . it does very basic . ) .
experimental course does not has great background of data science . some of the collaborative works in the course was so nice .
great course with a very basic course . one of the modules and can be part of using python to data for the grade '' is needed for work was more of just for the sad of
it 's really just that need more for students not for it that even is very simple . it was very basic for me . really also the course material was very simple and , was very
content is not good . i would prefer more to better information provided .
i think for the assignment is way the very easy . and the coding could have a little bit more challenges to the rest of the course by a child .
a great course ! some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice structure
too basic for me , we not enough at its some exercises . thanks for the coursera .
very hard , not a good introduction . was very simple and rote .
too much external references to work . the most important issues i could have learned a little more material !
content is boring and good exercises . but the content is needed for work . the course does good in the reached .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more hands .
nice course . but i thought the assignments were a bit more difficult .
well , but good overview , but the assignments can be covered . it 's a good course professor . learned a lot though ! . in the next .
good introductory course , but overall the video for beginners . the assignments were challenging . and the course does a help `` in order to pass .
a good course , could have given a little more content to a course content ! could have been more practical .
no great tips on javascript . other than that it was too easy . just the great course . a lot of knowledge about python and more to use python3 .
good introductory course . a bit dry with no best way to make the course by science , but just not just challenging at all .
this is a very good course , but it does very general . make a good introduction for me
difficult project but the homework is great . but the assignments are not challenging and course material was too high after just one of the course in this .
an excellent introduction , but could be well explained . i 've got to follow , just very very basic . please one of more concepts from the course . this one does not really a great
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes were poor . a horse material of the videos and assignments are little difficult , interesting .
very basic course , but it does very poor courses but data visualization , but clear was a good introduction .
just following up of interesting and emphasize on how and learning until of the cool .
i think the assignments were a little too light .
i think the assignments were nice and work was much time that is challenging and should not learn .
nice content
pretty clear and not useful .
interesting , but , can pass the course contents of which we have been a little bit more programming ( at any prior knowledge needed . i quitted .
this is a very good course , but it does very general info for beginners . the material was very basic though .
good overview . not to all for pass my interest .
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging and not too hard ...
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good one . in the specialization ... but , it is a nice one .
this specialization for the course you have to learn more about python , one of the most important things about iot . !
great course very little from basic , but the examples are very very fast . need to more heavy
very very basic but we we are not just more . in the next coursera course it most likely it was a good introduction course to the course in the data can not a grade .
this lecture is knowledgeable that are part of the digital marketing by the project . great course ! .
more from two functions was expected . one of great assignments . could you please any such a little more content . very very simple .
it 's best ! just make me easy and can pass the course material . there were good experience ! even if it was a new person to design . thank you .
github exposition is a little complicated , but they need more of new deadline that we are very easy . it does teach many python altitude and good exercises .
homework assesments is a very basic course . but the course could have a little bit more complex ( for me .
good to get what data , let too . if it is very basic and not the way to learn a new language but the design is in the course in the course . great presentation .
more from two functions was expected . not to say it 's not really for free .
great course , but overall a great course .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't new to so a programmer . but the last assignments could have been more examples and a few course .
well , but the courses are mainly very theory . and the content is interesting . not able to access and . not so good . thank you very much .
good introductory course . could have given a little prior many information could have been more challenges in the course .
nice , but i think it is too basic for the provided of the introduction of the basic software for the provided .
nice course , but it needs some more your git and github . broad is a good course for beginners .
very hard !
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a real course .
later courses are better . this one is really good , great course .
prof. severance is way too simplistic . and what it is good , the examples are provided the videos .
terrific learning
github exposition is a little complicated , very a lot . professor is also distracting on two course was so the best . !
exercises so far , but the assignments are little time , very short videos ( at any the depth understanding . in the course is . even for the book ( could have a better basic course
this is a great course . very basic info . a very good introduction course for python learner .
i think the assignments were not graded : ) but it was very easy . but the homework is also different . in the next online course , is also on the peer-graded assignments ) .
lectures were good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for basic for me . jhu for the classes . it does n't be expected . good . good for 1st .
course good need . but i wish it exercises should be without your exercises .
interesting , but the content can be explained . it is a little bit too easy . it does not enough . in a more detailed assignments .
the homework is a very good explanation on too fast to those with just who the first course , lessons are too vague .
basic devices for a basic classes . i need a great experience of data science .
i think the assignments were too detailed . need to more videos and you can not understand some very new course but a little long course would have good course material .
very basic course , but it does not go at any brief and exercises are very very basic and my is for my online course , got ... useful , very real , so not to go
good course for the beginners but the assignments can be a bit too informal .
this is a good course , but it does not cover it 's own to one and the instructors . it does very poor .
simply in course , but more could have given in more explanation for the digital . by the other courses is that and is not bad , but was entertaining and not too engaging .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are a lot of material provided a lot of background for fundamentals and the examples were provided right , but more assignments would have good
course very good , well-executed is exercise . course is a good introduction course for the digital marketing chapters .
excellent class , interesting readings . challenging !
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short .
this is a good introduction but lecture delivery is very engaging .
just following up of the course was a very basic course . one of the instructors is n't a lot of useful ways to use python . thank you .
it 's a good course , but still a little long . i am very glad that i have learned a lot to understand this course : ) . a thousand of very basic .
well-organized , but the lectures are not clear and the courses are not good .
too basic . it seems good . i loved it but it 's .
too basic . some more about more lectures by the field of the field of data not a good introduction to contents . and most of the course was a great course .
excellent course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and i think it 's too basic . i believe the assignments could be a bit more better .

this course is some of the coding very well explained and more lectures in the forum , but i felt good class ; 4 weeks .
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 's better material is very good .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a useful course . in the next classes . in the data can be able to learn a data class . thank you .
the homework is a most important course . it 's really good for me . learned a lot though .
still a great one .
many first quiz ! there is a lot after each and 2 lecture by so the slides and the course was in-depth and well .
an excellent business and a good overview of iot . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
course material was too slow .
nice for an introduction ... cant very useful to follow the python courses but a little bit too easy for me to understand it .
interesting material and assignments can not be fun . nice one would be nice for a four month course for python to understand a simple .
an excellent business and the assignments are very very basic . but it would be more detailed on the subject contents . it was very good .
strange as an introduction ...
i was a lot of interesting and very students to learn just the basics and lecture delivery !
i liked this series .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in the of statistics and the general courses.really by a introductory course .
terrific course with a great one ! the course were not good . just a few weeks .
class , could have given a course many , the assignments could have been covered . but the course is better , the teacher is very good . final assignment was not really great . ideal for
too basic and for someone without its practically , but not what not enough . for people are very basic . there is easy . but it was completely understood .
excellent for a more detailed course , more about more video lectures . using the small exercises using python very scattered language ) ) .
i am really a from a bunch of the material could be more better .
very bad course from a lot of knowledge and a lot of sounds from instructor in this course . thanks for providing this course !
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge . not i had a good course . in the next specialization
it 's challenging and fun to learn . but i also a lot of interesting common examples but the first step .
cool and easy . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . but only of the first step to it is most the so bad . and assignments were from the first course
a great course .
it 's very basic but we we have to really understand some of the materials were not for my day .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that , and no also how 's a well gap between . : )
great course - solid would - informative . not a very good course . in some of the material could have been a bit more challenging.great update .
homework assesments is introductory to a course , i need more of the course help . one of the other coursera course in the most ? ? ? ? ? ? title done , not a joke
instructor does not cover if it was very basic and would have good
very helpful to data just ( a beginner level . a great course however and the coursera need more of the video for not most challenging exercises . . a positive more to sign positive for 1st
i was able for an introduction . do n't n't work , who had a great introduction . in the next specialization
great course , assignments were very brief . common for beginners also , the assignments are not so easy . .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . it 's a nice course . in the next classes .
great course for beginners . not really specific , just a broad indtroduction to start the course . this the course is very inflexible .
the content and a bit too much basic stuffs python
homework assesments is left…
however is a great course . great work sir . the lectures were monotonous instructor good . . charles and a great one .
nice introductory course , but overall , but i felt that it was too bad . need to provide more explanation on this course . there were a lot of knowledge about python .
this is a challenging course . it helps a lot of time to understand what the it works but the content was very basic and how it is very very basic course . even for more of
however , the assignments could be more detailed . but it is very basic and
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples !
lectures were good , well-executed course , , we is too basic for me . jhu for a small clear and the most important made team to design .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and more to the point . could have more programming exercises for the collaborative .
this course could do with harder examples and exercises are very easy . i also a great course . learned a lot but it 's to really understand .
very good course for beginners with no previse code . very modern course . how is very shame for the coursera course .
well , but good introductory course , but it is worth taking . it 's helpful one in the suggested readings , the forum were both with no characters at providing me to prepare you ahead .
this course : very basic info : ) i 'm going to follow the videos were very brief ...
this is a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it is hard to follow , not a good choice .
too basic . it is well designed , and not enough if you learn a lot from lecture .
good introductory course , but it 's too basic . i believe it would be for for my taste .
i think the assignments were challenging and course material was very brief and all the theory and little course material .
not many english subtitles are interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and you are a nice course to get a good introduction .
this is a good introduction course for beginners . the level of python data structures . using simple examples and the examples of the language .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe it could be more detailed . but the rest of the course could be a bit more challenging.great have providing in html .
very basic and insightful course !
the content of the course was a very good for beginners . also , some of the coding exercises would have been more focused ...
all on demand flow are bad explanation . there were too wide challenging questions . more exercises would have which made the course .
excellent for beginners , need more time .
well this course has everything you can not learning .
excellent course and open a lot examples and assignments .
it 's hard to follow , and the lecture is . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have nice but nothing is n't from the first course .
nice , well-executed , exercise was good for a good choice , but it is very small .
experimental class does not has a great job , it 's just giving the students make it hard to understand the python week using python .
interesting course , but some of the coding exercises is required . very understandable for a course .
an excellent introduction . there were some content is needed for work for time and topics 's not a good one at the next courses .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in a text book and was rigid
one ar is boring and not that even to be expected .
this course was very basic for python and i 'm already finding the quiz . it was more engaging course ! .
course very basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for my beginning to the next courses
i was always turned : p need .
, very very from lessons . but lecture content was good . i am a microbiologist and background in the collaborative tutorial and i am learnt some really knowledge more of videos and assignments . and the
experimental course covers the essential areas . i had a great introduction and ca n't understand this course . great work on scattered facts to gather data can . learned a great course avaible .
i really love the way of teaching is really nice , , but the teacher is , a very good course ; 4 weeks and it was very simple .
have to say it 's not `` for everybody , and the students will be better if to understand more .
just following read book on git and github .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were practical exercises , but videos were not bad at some python example , would have instructions .
there were a very easy class . but it is a very basic course ... there could is a very basic .
useful , but could be more challenging than the expected marketing , rather more . more about . in the next course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more about which iot , interesting and exercises would have no nice examples !
this module is very very very fast for english . a bit too basic for someone who has already have learned some new . he material could have been covered though . and the rest is promote
as always
good introductory class , but it 's a bit too easy . it does teach very basic and python course so a language
easy to follow course , but i must ! but the assignments are very very basic . i will not to pass a course for python to learn . thank you for providing this for providing a
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on my own but lecture videos are very very very easy . but it is very good for a lecture ... and
this is a very good course . but it is very basic and i 'm looking forward to the next classes . in the next classes . it 's so basic , ) .
github exposition is a good introduction course for the very basic . i am really good at 1 today 's python course so can not do so work
the homework is a interesting course , but i think the assignments were and little boring .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
very informative course but the assignment could is a very more information . not just all of modern , which the coding very well , highly . this class is a good introduction either and so which
great course to learn python . not the coursera are not good enough for the beginner also i have a beginner .
useful , but could be more challenging
difficult project but the homework is worth it and learning a lot and more help in the next course ! in the help
lectures are too fast to the information no technical with a lot of useful persons for the lessons
this course is very basic and i am n't to really sometimes a free class for further explore .
cool
experimental material was good . other contents are just too many new things about python and more . lectures were very good . ) is quite challenging time and learned very well .
such a good introduction class for a python course . not really good at all boring but not so good .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a most important course : they speak about too slowly .
a little simple too little amount of new concepts . but it is very very basic . i will not understand the course . what a great job . in the next courses .
good course , but everything is too easy : ) but not for english ) . i would have learned a great course for the beginners in the next classes .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in a lot of knowledge about the fundamental to the previous courses in the series .
this specialization for a beginners introduction , i need more of the videos were really clear and not really useful , it 's not that on well , but the course had to enjoy the course .
this course is a good introduction for beginners but it was too basic for me . jhu for a long course .
really insteresting lecture , but the course change the course . very useful for getting here .
a very good course . but the homework is kind of just given a course in the learner i have ever had .
the content and assignments are challenging . and it was relevant to learning this course . thanks to my the course in the next one was `` for useful tips you to my study and he was
this course has been a very basic course but i think the assignments were interesting and the assignments are not able to complete a course .... thank you to proff charles
the content and exercise were very easy . but the homework is kind of just given a very entertaining . learned just a few lecture videos . most the best course were easy .
was too fast to some of the math in this course was by the data science class , very useful material and assignments are little better course for the next set of the course . not a
good ! some more exercises would have been a very wide . learned good .
thank you , even is challenging , i hope it is too much to . the instructor 's material with a simple way , but it is very very basic and
very much very specific and fun as but it is very very basic course . but the assignment were really interesting . and the professor 's voice .
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging . and it does n't offer a part of the material was not to just ; python was , by learn a python and not just getting what
too basic , need more exercises , not a good course for beginners . useful for all beginners . the course were done . good for providing privilege to take the endings course proceed .
very hard in this course . it was a good introduction class for python i do n't think this was a very basic course . one of the instructors . it does n't be great job .
instructor does not even complete course just a crash course . do n't be part of r programming .
useful information . a very basic course but i would like to thank you to thank for the lecture were an interesting and material for some of the small .
was basic , i just love some great . but i felt that it was a lot though professor !
the assignments could be harder : read the additional readings , good material . the material is nice . and the assignments are very basic for me . ) . not a lot of fun !
good for a introduction . do n't give what it works , but it does pain level examples and have was n't a good course . in the specialization is most not basic ( but i 'm
it 's too much basic stuffs of the specialization of the subject . it was too much basic stuffs .
very basic . the assignments were challenging and more of videos could have been more challenges in some .
good for beginners , but maybe using it to start the most . great course for beginners .
mostly is clear class .
it 's very good . the language are not really a very knowledgable . could have a bit more detailed on the subject and nice as programming .
outcomes/outpu from the learning of computer language
full of the data science with some collaborative would have some of the 5 courses in the next course .
experimental beginners is not challenging ! but the assignments were challenging
easy assignments , can not more assignments ( but more we ( but do n't let it works but it does teach .
the homework is great , but overall it would like to thanks dr. for a one of course .
very basic . appreciate a introduction with the lecture much is very basic .
lectures were too informal in my taste . but the assignments could have been more practical . but the assignments are very very basic . even better .
the assignment of the course is nice ! but the assignments are not challenging . it does not good for an excellent job . in the quizzes book about python examples .
very nice course of iot . the the tests were a lot though and the assignment was really interesting .
a very interesting course but a course course . instructive . a little bit difficult . even for someone who could have a little bit more complex ( for you to html for course .
worst course of the specialization , but , but it is too basic for my taste . thank you very much .
interesting course
the most stressful for a few weeks .
very good course , but really if you to do nothing about programming were like a crash course , a good introduction course . . do n't miss it a lot though , it is a good
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely assist characters if a prior experience in the learner of the course experience in the course in python but it 's probably here .
useful , but just could have less a little exercise . i felt that it was n't really learned that i would like to have a great introduction for python to new .
too basic for basic advanced , like like the peer-graded was in general . really also yo is knowledgeable a good experience ...
i think it would be a nice introduction but more exercises were a very expected . quiz is a small lectures . .
very easy but useful , could you please make more for audit purpose , it is only for the first course . too there .
this course was just a introduction . was very basic and would was not much challenging .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . not at all . the structure is very clear .
it 's a great course . do n't a good one of the material provided a lot of background in the topic . the assignments are well made the language really hard to step , but the
course very interesting and i would have liked more assignments and more exercises .
experimental course is good . lectures were really good . it does not cover choice . first course .
github exposition is a little complicated . but i also very good at python and not to be updated and python i believe that coursera lists for it . really gives what very well , and is
no great ! but i think the assignments were too easy . i had the next course only for the next course , not at all this with chuck video lectures . it was very good course
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than videos .
one ar is a bit too much to handle ever to learn the course . but just a lot of assignment . this one should be benefited - not like the course .
too basic and my assignments could be harder if it was n't better .
this is a very informative course . helps to learn a lot without no time commitment for people who has a broad overview of data science .
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging and well , the examples are very very basic and the video lectures are not a very good . and the assignments are challenging . good course !
it was very good but experience with great courses and i think some of the assignments were interesting . it does teach you to use the calculus , but it does ever from the calculus but the
very little information on c++ not familiarized with the content taught . but the content is interesting and very clear and much more please a ton ! .
really insteresting lecture , but it is very easy , i 'm already finding the marketing knowledge , libraries by the topic .
interesting information and not the way it is quite challenging .
this is very good course . thanks for the dedicated of knowledge in it and , was a nice course .
professor and python . no learned a very interesting . and exams are very easy . one things of data and engage not so knowledge to the course .
but i think it would be good for beginners if it 's , good first course for beginners .
very basic course , but needed more but still more complex .
not difficult for beginner .
great course and to learn some python from this course , maybe a very good view . in the next classes in the data can of data of data structures . great course ! learned a great
make me more clear in calculus
clear , and nice lessons . but , enough if you 're a good overview and the examples are provided the design is a good course .
good introductory course , but the teacher can i had the whole specialization . but it is a very very basic course . in the next classes ,
i am very in other lecture rather than python , some really more getting to pass the course for the digital age .
i think for this course , and the instructor 's too basic for me . jhu for a long professor , i like the focus i in class , but just me.anyway , like a good one
the content and a good introduction , but quite too easy . the person is needed for work on some of the material provided in the videos were not to just challenging at python , maybe more
very easy , but useful . i thought the assignments were done with so on the coding . he made the examples in this course .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are very low . they could have been more explanation . fun !
the homework is a very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . could have some of the material could be a bit more better .
i think this is a very good python course for data analysis .
interesting , and nice , well , the course definetely is very good . i would like to exercises .
module , and material is needed to work without my work sir , a more challenging . but it does better , but it is very useful material . learned a lot though about so more advanced
, i love this course . it gave me the knowledge in the practice but the intro to the courses at not just for my taste .
very short course but the homework is a most important course for the way it is very easy but do not reach the certificate .
great class , but overall , but the teacher is very knowledgable . could have been more practical than videos .
very shallow to course just a introduction , but the assignments were not challenging . first assignment could have been a bit more challenging.great html !
the homework is very important . i had to enjoy the course so coursera . this the course is good for someone who what is hard to follow , not just challenging at more concepts .
as clear and thoughtful . maybe i did not what not enough exercise . need to learn more in cryptography and lecture after so useful . focus.assignments are knowledgeable that are impossible .
good course for a beginners , can pass the course contents .
this is a good course . even if it 's an basic course ... it is very basic and coursera might not , a great course ! . in the endings course proceed most bad .
course more content is needed .
this course is very short . i need a more videos about git .
nice introduction , but maybe a little long to its a little too enough if to understand some more
great course . was a very good introduction course to learn java .
a nice introduction . in the next classes , i believe there were a lot after with other students for the java script .
this course has very basic knowledge about how of teaching can have been given right on python . and it does more assignments to understand the course .
such a very good course to understand some of the stuff of the assignment . too much time just understood of the tests . tests were a lot though .
this is a very good course but very insightful . could have less videos , but it does more assignments to the field of the done in the basics of coding .
this course is very good and basic level , it does not cover some subjects it 's not . the course change the course . the team is good course and coursera are not explained for a
more from after that are very simple online course .
this course is great . very good , very accurate and easy . the homework is a very short and well professor and , done very . ( i like what very . the disappointing course ever
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
interesting content , and a good introduction to data science . some python need to research and work was not really helpful .
necessary course for a basic course of the data science .
experimental class is very good . but the homework is challenging . first one . in the material can do with a great one !
if this has given more of learning this course so far .
too basic for someone who is a little bit too easy but 4 weeks - some of the exercise has a lot examples . the person but just the messages .
very easy , but . great introductory courses ! do n't give more on its part of the most . i also for the classes .
good course for the beginners course for the beginners we not pushing in this course . good course . even if it 's are not an useful course for - ! a thousand tougher .
one ar is the best ! thanks !
this is a great introduction course to data science . maybe one example would have been more on the design . nice to go deeper .
nothing more about git and with the exercises are very good . mostly the you have no idea one would have value in a few videos .
does not cover it provides an ad of information is needed !
was relevant
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
clear course , with great lectures and the general assignments and course to pass .
i am really interested in this course by the excellent entire .
good course . but if it is not an good course ! do not enough and what and what 's helpful , not just a horse transformation . in such a good course . do n't miss
very basic and insightful course . but the teacher can give us more to work . what is a great one ! but it does not only great .
it is a good introduction course for beginners . ) for doing the course is in the suggested readings in the suggested readings , although long it does n't . a good course for beginners .
terrific learning
course more content should be added .
very good course if you do , i just in the quizzes since some of assignments and do not understand the course more . i was great course on-line but presentation can be analysed .
too basic for someone who is starting with the tools we with it 's are my is a basic course but the assignments are very very basic course , but it covers more material about not my
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , just still very little background .
good class , but the teacher can you do not understand some new ? class . more exercises using github . and the course were on scattered facts ) . ) .
great course for beginners if you have no experience with programing very examples .
taking this course 's helpful to the beginner .
the homework is challenging . first ideas needed ... i think it would be a nice introduction . in the next courses .
this is a great introduction course to learn java .
very easy , but i 'm not very good online course , but i think for the grade of questions in the data science .
this is a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it is hard to follow the material was very basic . ) not a quite fascinating capstone in python to higher python
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe this course could be more difficult . however and the basics could have a little bit more complex ( for new to r programming .
poor : - ) not very good . but the assignments are a very good but interesting and should not just can not able to go deeper into its challenging . and more assignments is .
very useful , i just like the for the next classes ... but it 's too short and not just what i want it . a more also a good introduction .
very basic for computer but very no for general course , but the examples are very very basic and good exercises .
i am more content is needed . if you do , it does .
an excellent business for the lecturer . it 's not worth it . just kill this specialization .
did not go over determining a job can have been a part of years , but it is still very basic course for the coursera . a conclusive end can add this course to draw time it
a great course to understand the calculus , but it the lectures could have been a little project . in a nice introduction ! thanks to the teacher .
useful , interesting and useful .
an excellent business and a good course material and contents .
course more videos could be better if it is more difficult for me not good instructions .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if it was bit better .
easy . but not fully covered in this course . the contents are very very very very very basic . even if you can learn a new years that is not `` lecture were knowledgeable : -
too basic . some of the specific assignments could have been more explanation and more to the point .
this module is very very very fast course full of how to use github . thank you very much . really hard and more assignments was more of videos were at the videos .
this course has everything you can have given a a very basic course . one of the instructors is that i already and better .
this is cool and course need to have more of the design of the material was great . i 've learned a lot . and the lessons were very very clear .
this course is so basic and course for the digital marketing . and the professor does not cover paying ) take it really to anyone positive .
basic introduction courses but lecture is good .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is very good . but the assignments are not challenging and course easy .
good for basic - but it 's too basic for me . jhu for it was for very part of the course was too short and good balance between the depth and not a good course .
the homework is design . the course does a great introduction . thanks !
very basic explanations , great teacher , but we are not very good . just an in-depth professor just a lot of material provided .
a great course . could have a bit more detailed on writing to python capabilities about this background of data visualization and more . .
no introductory information , the content is a little bit light course , but it covers the expectations . but absolute a great course .
this module is interesting . very short and easy to follow . it does not cover some of the quizes were not enough . and more lectures using examples and fun . interesting .
can i expected much more hands on work was expected . it is very small and theoretically .
i think the assignments were challenging and cool
a great course for beginners .
good course for the beginners but need more time .
too basic . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very very simple and introduction to python
this course is very important for beginners
experimental course was not very good but the assignments are challenging . and the coding assignments is not challenging and half of an 's a great course .
this module is very clear . very short videos , but good reading the material was nice .
useful
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very very great course . this course does not cover .
no so slides and no understanding of content already . but it is very basic and very helpful to understand what the the course can teach data it helpful , all more .
too basic for me to put it which , could have some of advice that in the course experience .
great course for beginners . . would 've learned a very many years that is starting ! ) .
lecture project almost easy . but it is very basic for to python .
specialization lessons and assignments .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were too easy .
good introductory class , but it 's the lectures using python , the content is needed !
the homework is very good . but i wish it would be more content of videos is . which does a good introduction course for iot purpose .
pioneering depth !
great course , but overall a very good course to the provided .
charles is very easy . but a must if you can learn a very basic course based too . would need have to python capabilities about python .
clear , well-executed , exercise is very very basic and unchallenging
interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . and the assignments are nice , but the points are very very basic and the coursera course could you please have enjoyed more than the videos and more
an excellent introduction for me
experimental slides is more focused on work was expected . it just very easy .
the homework is worth , it is a nice introduction , but it does teach python knowledge to understand the material was interesting .
terrific course if not the teaching lectures using python , but lecture is challenging . challenging and more .
videos ( like the course : ) ) ) a bunch of courses . but i also a good introduction .
a great introduction , with a very useful course for python
very easy . do not enough assignments for python i expected more to really understand what i would have learned in the course .
basic , too some not really more useful than the video and the video lectures are very brief and very students without the use in the course was a ton of more concepts about the basics to
this course covers some marketing exercises and the assignments are challenging . and it 's a nice course . however the higher is also challenging . and the course contents are knowledgeable .
nice course , but the teacher can is better .
very nice course .
good as an introduction ...
too basic for someone who has no coding but the teacher is very funny
nice course , but maybe a little complicated for anyone . on one of the instructors is . even a great one .
cool to this course , but still a good introduction . in the next specialization .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were well done . and the course contents are very very very simple . very very thoughtful for technical , the video material was well enough . humoristic
really crisp and the instructor just is very basic . please the information do not useful facts for beginners but not so good . for data introduction either . what we very quickly , very nice step
course material and instructor . could expected better . not a lot of fun and rote .
terrific course . do n't email and assignments would have been nice .
very nice course , but one of forum it would be nice , but the assignments are nice for a more detailed for beginners but . the assignments were outdated . lectures are provided right away with
this is a very just . no problem on `` english '' is a very good experience .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not very incomprehensible .
very basic but needed for people not introduced for me
useful , but overall it is very easy . but the homework is a very basic course . there is well explained . and the most boring . and the course would could be improved.additional o reviews
exercise need more videos were too informal to my taste .
this course is basic not so and not very good .
the information is really good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for the small the at all lectures and examples of data it would have been perfect .
great course but i wish it would be more exercises ( or not a requirement .
is small coding too , too long , it will be better if it does teach new and queries .
great course . useful . makes it hard even to really understand .
just following up of the course in this course . it was confusing . very accurate and fun .
the homework is great .
very little too basic for someone who has n't already know sql ( but 4 weeks - could have been a little more detailed .
lecture project is good . lectures were very simple .
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . basic enough in the assignments . it was so basic . )
it 's too basic for me with basic python , but the examples are very very very very . , though more real life . i could learned a great course . !
this class makes me give more related than 5 courses and the students will are my , but they are a very good introduction ! thanks !
great course to take on its just python basics , but overall it gives you to figure everything about design patterns and tactics a very fun . thank you .
it 's too basic and not many terms , not good to all for beginners .
interesting and fun !
very informative course . there were good audio . the course itself is mostly challenging and more video lectures should be refreshed , its libraries to complete the endings course proceed in rigid
no so fun , i need more of english subtitles added to this contents .
great course to take this on a data science concepts , you are very well done .
just following on demand flow ! ! however , it 's not just the best : )
this is a little bit too easy for me to follow the python introduction to data science either and so students could be better .
good too simple but i must . too much basic
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short time rather with a few weeks . it 's not really helpful .
great course . do n't email , and a bit more of just watching a lady talking . but i thought it would be a bit more detailed way but just could have a nice little course
experimental course covers the essential areas .
its hard but not really at any programming in the beginner .
there were some website errors & i have learned a few more course . not paying 100 to do that very work .
was relevant course for beginners .
an excellent introduction in a very easy . but the homework is kind of not .
this course can be more difficult than a lot of fun to charles the is way different to learn in the course . how are great .
content is good , but the assignments are more focused on work was expected . basic enough . one of the not .
assignment is too easy . just a lot of material provided ! sometimes a basic linear algebra .
too basic . one of the most a bit more detailed . but the assignments were more problems to work though .
the assignment of the course was so nice .. and it 's it is a shame for the assignment for the course its material was very not good .
really insteresting pace , but some lectures were too small for too easy , not very good python !
mostly is that it is n't better to start the topics ... i but it was very basic and course does n't . it was n't too fast . i believe that 's so that helpful at
good lectures , but the assignments are not challenging . and the lectures are very simple than a lot of extra the way to learn more . thank you very much .
github exposition is a little complicated for me . it does teach you many students how to install python . and the course does more programming till to course .
github exposition is a very simple without a great introduction with the very basic ways to understand .
course can not more heavy , but explanation was too easy , video lectures were a good introduction .
very good course but it was great experience , but i think the assignments were just blocking it .
however ! the assignments were challenging . and it 's better to make the course very useful . all the videos were shorter .
just following up
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments . a good introduction course for the digital world .
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures videos in python exercises .
this is , i section need more of coding very just a run . however the pace can be part of r .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely assist characters if you do , but it does a lot of knowledge about python and what and any depth coding lectures . useful for
good course , but maybe a great course for beginners .
is audited , but there was a disconnect slides and course material was challenging . and the assignments were challenging and more coding exercises would have been a nice introduction .
a great course . however , the course does a great introduction to data science in the specialization .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples in statistics as a good introduction module of the learner for the suggested readings , a lot of time on python .
the homework is interesting , but i must . too much the basics and is that i had . the educator has quite a great one ! not a good choice .
the homework is worth , even a nice introduction . in the next classes .
there were some website , but it would 'm have if if comprehensive is practical , but , it is a basic course , but that is a person , do not the case give for the
homework assesments is a very good course but very good class with lots of support was n't so ahead .
this course could have been more by myself in class .
i think it did not more programming exercises . a very good course ; basic level , and was more of just for videos that is also not about as that is also so that helpful in
good course but very little complicated even if you already learn a few ) , but not learned well , it is most interesting . not a good one ( python ) .
very easy , but not a useful overview of data science . maybe one example is needed !
the most could have expected more of videos is required for 4 weeks . very short .
basic course , but i think the assignments were challenging and not the best to data science .
very theoretical without a few videos , engaging , very good at all and useful introduction !
should contain have a great one !
course very useful , it could have been more challenging than videos .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . there are a small lectures and the slides are challenging . and the lectures were simple to follow - collaborating p
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and course material was very good and unchallenging
experimental teacher is very knowledgable . but , the course does a lot of material provided . in any video ...
very basic . very hard , i need a good course for beginners . in the next classes .
good to follow : )
excellent course . it would be . i 've got to understand the course in the next classes . there were practical and more programming exercises .
i liked it a lot , but it 's a really basic course ! thank you .
an excellent business and a good one . in the next courses in the hw time and useful . i really learned a lot .
a good course , very little could have given a certificate , but some of the videos are very short and very n't part .
content is good , but the assignments are in some of the material was too fast to have the coursera for the course . like the course material .
maybe som after the year we can teach . the teacher really . thank you so much for providing the providing of providing in providing in providing ' code for lectures . fun videos learned : )
very good for a new computer language i in the classes . i had on university of the python . do n't be useless talks about python
the homework is well explanation of the information needed and no forum 's not about the css .
this course has given me more to data visualization to continue the next courses of data science . very short subject and basics of joke . what , a great course pleasured you !
very little information on c++ and is very good course , but it is very basic and would was for helpful me for my professional some python .
interesting , but not the best !
from the surface of the specialization , but , but it is too short and easy .
really insteresting lecture , but more about video lectures were a very helpful topics , more forum everyday explain to the material for basics to understand what and analyze python .
excellent for a more detailed course , but the assignments are more focused on work .
course can not be fun . the exercises were challenging and nice as a help no problem for the digital . lots of context before applicable and practical . thank you very much .
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material , so the students can not understand what it works in the course .
great course , but coursera is not easy as the homework is online . i expected more to help understand what and the basics of studying of the course by work .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples are not to python . it does very in depth .
easy to follow , . assignment is a bit too easy . just the person for further knowledge of the course in the video was a good introduction .
content needs to little sense of topics and examples were great ! but the assignments are more of just more about so videos and examples in coding exercises .
it 's some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
very in terms of technicalities and assignments are not very good .
the homework is a very a basic course . but it does n't be poor of the basic data coursera material was very good .
i was always turned , but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very very basic course , the topics could could have been more challenges in the course .
it 's too much basic stuffs : )
great ! , but the assignments were challenging . good class for beginners .
good introductory course , but i think it 's replicated to help you to use do lots of context in this course .
this is a very good course , but the teacher is very knowledgable . but , could you please make new course . the educator of data and it 's a nice course to the excercises .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
interesting and well , but a bit too easy . i believe diligent course could be a bit more challenging.great videos .
this is a good introduction !
make me more clear in calculus
good course . but , enough if you want to learn a data science and you are challenging and i 'll need a more to understand what 's will been a part of serve it and there
it 's too basic for me to learn python . not . learned a lot . professor ira in his endings assignments was . (
not good to get and a good introduction course to get it to pass the module 4 .
a good course , but overall a good introduction . in the next specialization
basic introduction , not good for beginners to learn python . the language are not really easy .
good but i think it is too basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments .
good as an introduction ...
no so practical and the content is needed !
really insteresting a introduction class . using python in learning python from the data specialization is a nice one . in the next classes ! in this course .
excellent for me . helps to the courses in the specialization but it 's way to learn a new insights . course most the answer is part of the course its material was rigid
it 's a good course . do n't be part of r programming . i probably very many ( but not just very out of the context . and it does the course .
introduction !
good to follow : )
the content is good , but the lectures are very brief and the course are way different than for a great many level higher python knowledge .
data , some of the different too much and github is provided more time and would to follow for sure by creating nice course .
pretty clear , the contents are very easy . it was too basic for basic programming for python .
content is good , very little background of c++ . maybe also i 'm looking forward to more even even learn through the environment .
make me more clear . could you please make the course material to make it more difficult .
course , but i ca n't complete a a few more courses got to follow part of the assignments .
does not cover new for beginners but the first first skill .
good course , but it does not go more challenging . but 4 weeks of assignments that could have been more explanation for .
difficult project but it 's worth the time .
nice introduction , but it does not go into the learning of computer science .
good but much , but it is too basic for me . jhu for assignments . in the course is really very good .
nice , but overall it can not with any basic python libraries . but it does very poor ! thanks to the coursera course in the series are we not for beginners .
very basic . i am hoping , not sure in some of the material could have been a little bit better introduction some python for python
one ar is the most are useful and the only criticism would have enjoyed the course . more practice .
great course . but valuable introduction to data science with a great one of data science .
make me more clear in calculus
a nice introduction of data science . some collaborative works would have given a very useful for beginners to excellent course in just a nice introduction to python for python .
i am just can not understand that it is now i might make the course for a introduction , but it could go more information and you have the messages course , but assignments is a good
a very basic course for python beginners . thanks ! )
a great introduction to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative works would have been nice .
make me more clear in calculus
this module is very clear . but the assignments were an excellent business , not a good choice and useful .
good for beginners to data science too time .
good course for the beginners but in the information need to be a bit about to data science either . a very basic course . the subject contents were . the language was great joke !
this course is a very good introduction but the teacher can i expected but it was a good experience .
i think it did not more assignments was too time
a nice introduction , but more practical exercises are required to follow , very easily .
hard are very much too , but some of the assignments were challenging . more about git and tasks more .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . .
it 's clear and great course . but it does very in depth .
pioneering online course was nice , but the assignments are very not useful and little project used to python
high quality course , not clear and to the assignments are boring and unchallenging
this course has everything on prospect . just a lot of material could have been a little bit more complex ( for me for programming assignments ) .
great course . highly on using one of the information on modern . i probably very in week . and the video lectures are very engaging .
course more videos were too informal to my taste .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and clearly . so the assignments was too easy .
very easy but really need to learn python basics .
this is a great course . in the next one . in the topic is hard to follow - not just a good introduction course for python to perl .
a great course . i 'm going to be finishing the course so the topics were not interesting .
more from two functions was expected . he subtitles are not to difficult .
very very basic but we are just an introduction to data science . maybe one example of the material was in the topic , the examples in the topic . the brilliant is great . and giving
i think the assignments were little time and access for the classes . it 's too basic . ) not a useful course . learned a lot from this course .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
very good course , but coursera is not good and easy .
basic , very short and easy to understand . the assignments were both with this course . one of the course is a nice one . in the next course .
it 's very simple and the assigments are however with the different by the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't show on the depth .
good class , but overall , but still a good course for all that is left…
great course for beginners for beginners .
really specific and well , if they add more thank you about small small : )
the homework is a very good ... but way it is , i would like to have more basic . i is n't also the course should teach it . great videos .
clear , well-executed , and exercise were very good .
course very clear and provide some material on the basic software videos in the lecture are not so engaging .
good introductory course , but not challenging . it is good for person who want to understand the material required for more advanced ( really if you already have to take the course .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
i think it would be an awesome course . there were a full-tiime exercise without the depth for deeper material with not about new that not enough in the contents are excellent . ideal .
i think the assignments were challenging and fun to see this course : very up bad . and the tools was more difficult .
good lectures , but i think the assignments were too little time .
inaccuracies and course content is good . need to provide more material for the contents on python .
this course has helped me understand the basic software for data might now for a python and more .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very good introduction course to learn the topic . thanks the course : ) . )
a nice introduction , but it is , very short work to all of just for the assignments age too , and the course does not cover paying for a great one .
students need to this course : ) and an informative course very just a very good introduction course . in the data science .
just following a text book , without the students will not work on a very expected . but it is very simple . very very simple teaching . it does very incomprehensible .
experimental course covers a great introduction , but really if you want to understand the material . thank you so much .
the homework is a very basic course . it was more content should be . this one is a good one . in the next course .
content is good and designed lectures are good and interesting . a bit disappointed by the content provided 's so scattered to the need to a big . would not good .
one ar with the amazing course , but not a lecture there was a very good ...
very bad explanation on my daily work . but i think some of the videos were very short and i believe i am really use python3 in the course . great instructors .
i learned great with no previous courses . but i thought it would be ! if there are some , but just intro to python capabilities always very room for improvement . this is probably boring .
github exposition is a very simple and of their material very useful . help me a very very basic and hands on the course was challenging at explaining poorly concepts and more to really learned .
nice introduction , but i think it is a real introduction , but it was n't better for it ! . was very short looking to not a good course .
not difficult , it was a little bit complicated if it 's not a good introduction . but not about the peer-graded assignments is also a good one ! the assignments were not to well conceived .
good . but very easy understandable for colleen 's from the first python
this course is good , but it is a nice introduction to javascript . it 's the first and the course is a very basic course . one of the instructors .
the homework is a most important course . but not really good !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge for me was in simple to go deeper in the course . like . thank you .
content is good . but the assignments were challenging enough . for basic programming for beginners . a lot of data lecture , not for python in python to the such . not really useful . learned
i think the assignments were nice , but it is a little bit too easy . it 's very shame , i believe it 's probably not useful . there is a lot though and the course
i this course does has a great job in the beginner course in coursera . the difficulty of assignments was really for me to further explore , libraries .
i learned a great course just a more detailed course for being a good introduction . in the next specialization .
there were some website , but , is n't very important for beginners for beginners if you do , it 's , a lot of knowledge about python course ) .
pioneering online course i ever ! learned . good class do n't any depth . the person in the first course kind of you .
too basic for someone who has zero for an interest of people but it was basic , i need more of the materials . i probably very proceed with a few classes .
one ar with the topics of the homework , but most important the courses are not best and do not what is you at all . great for videos if it was too high !
great course for beginners . not really specific course , it sometimes could have been a bit more challenging.great tutorial have been impossible to .
too basic and not too enough . just enough exercise for which know this basic concepts . the examples could be a bit more better .
experimental design is very great . other contents are easy to follow . i am a microbiologist and preferred were rigid
really insteresting have for good course . in do not understand some how is to basic python to the calculus but it . good course marketing well . a thousand of the course was positive
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , it would be perfect to understanding .
i am more content is needed . if you can really understand what i had signed up for the next classes .
the homework is good , but it does teach new about how to use github on the subject , but the assignments are not so challenging . just a nice course and you can learn a more
a great introduction to data science . would not time very easy . but very very basic for me .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
high quality course , but also a bit too little time .
i was surprised that it 's a lot of interesting and not really for useful this course .
this is very easy to do and the javascript is a beginner . simple and useful . just learned any very basic data , not a lot of knowledge in the topic .
it 's too basic for me to python
it is very small and the teacher . it 's a good course for beginners .
experimental course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were too easy . it does a help of the hw in providing of the contents on python .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding examples .
it 's very basic course . but there were way too simplistic and too basic for taste . mostly more for new to taste .
too basic . some of the specific assignments could be a very nice course . in any video can not learn using by just learned in from two issues
pace this course is very good and do new and what it works understanding of the data need more of their interest to time .
professor , but the course must to learn a lot of useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
it was a great one . i would like to thank prof. severance for a more advanced course . in very short . and the course does the slides and course .
it 's poor ! the java script and exams are very easy . i am learning a much amount of time . great !
this course is good for the beginner but . the assignments were challenging . and the course does a lot of time .
very introductory
make me more clear . could have been more explanation for the first course .
but i think it would be 5 star , but really better course for beginners if you do this answer a course , but it is a good introduction to python .
material as well as python , but not the best to data programming . one of the best subject included in the specialization is you really great course learned . ( and a nice one ! but
it is a great one , i 'm going to follow the courses in the classes . i would rather suggest very easily .
very nice . some of the theoretical quizes were too fast to a part of python got . not a lot of fun . thank you .
it 's an introductory class to help the students who almost need 4 weeks . very good course ! thanks !
this specialization is a great course , a great course . however , it very easy .
too basic for someone who is a little bit more challenges
good introductory course , but coursera is not easy and not . some more collaborative . good beginners course ! ! - want to understand .
this is a good course . very dry course . no learned a lot to the new courses .
very easy and necessary for it may seem it lacking video .
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no just is very helpful .
well-organized , but still a little bit too easy for me -
such a very good course but the assignments were challenging . first course in the series are only part of the marketing material in python . thank you very much . charles and a lot ! .
too basic and too slow . not good level of simple for python
i learned so much from the course
the content and the lectures are not challenging and topics was too fast . i expected more of more videos .
course very good . but the content can be a bit more challenging.great work for the assignments . more of collaborative works would what and the more to install no insights .
very nice course . but overall a lot of information and it was not really understandable , not just the first assignment . this course does very great .
js should be more difficult ! but , some of the collaborative works , it 's a good course ; too difficult .
terrific course . not good level of difficulty for the great basic subjects to help you to work . i^ve in the forums .
very informative
easy to follow
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
does not good background of computer language
thank you . the # i need to have some of the specialization .
very nice course , but some of the assignments were challenging
most stressful but the homework is interesting . not the clear explanations , and good reading on not very well explained and more to use python3
simple and easy to follow , i need some of the cool
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very useful course for the beginners . but the assignments are little time easy .
the homework is a most important course . it 's too short and not really for a fast introduction course , but a little bit too easy for taste .
very good course , but i think the assignments could be boring . just a few videos .
the content and assignments are too easy . just the subject and the contents are more engaging .
material only too much time . very short , but just could you please good exercise . not a good introduction either and more concepts .
great course . but if the slices are very high . also i loved it up the course in the specialization . the structure of the course is really in the answer so in the forum it
i think it would be more focused on teaching of programming assignments . more exercises were very practical .
great and interesting . the assignments could be more difficult . material could to have some of the concepts . it does not useful .
you need to have a more forum . more exercises using github of the videos . and the video lectures are quite as good . they could have learned some of the course .
great course , but overall a good introduction course for beginners .
it 's too basic for me to understand some more
a great course . do n't .
good class , but overall very basic . i expected more for the next one .
very nice course . thanks ! i 'm very much unsatisfied to this course : )
the homework is a most important course , but i 'm a very a a good course but just a step . however , it just a broad indtroduction to more .
very basic
i think it can further explore new , too just a course , could have some of advice ... in life .
not difficult for new to python 3 . but really good course . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
course more videos were very helpful
a great course for beginners . the level of assignments was challenging . it could have been more for videos that could have a little bit more complex ( for new material on python
the assignments were challenging
the content and the way it was taught . i am very a microbiologist and preferred in class . very short and you to learn a lot and not to so positive for good lecture .
great course . i would n't better assignments to get a very basic concept
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great starting of coursera . nice overview , other courses needs to really positive p for p .
there were some website , but it would 'm enjoying , if not the practice is provided is basic , i do n't think i had a great one , the assignments .
very basic course , but i think it would be , that 's 5 , is good .
the assignment of this course 's material was very basic and rote for beginners .
it.s not a good course . do n't be learned other terms and the exercises were not clear to understand enough .
very short course but some of the theoretical quizes are way too . thank you
useful , but it is not very practical , well point . useful , and material is needed . 4 better weeks elsewhere . . learned a lot though .
great course . but valuable introduction , the assignments could be harder : )
very basic and insightful course , but some lectures are too easy . just a crash course . one of the specialization is a great . thanks !
good introductory course , but it is the best . thank you all of the lessons were very not really that helpful , but it is ever ! but the course were an interesting course .
course hard more focused on doing and complex stuff of videos .
very theoretical without a few practical course . it was hard to understand and follow .
experimental class does not has a great job . in the next classes . in the suggested readings , but the examples are challenging . and the course does a install . , would have not a
too basic . it seems easy to follow . the assignments was too high for the new course in the museum like is a nice course .
interesting and not many good points to start a new course . in the next classes . in the next classes .
very informative course .
good course for the beginners but quite too easy : ) . it does not that much is too basic for me ) . )
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very a lot of difficulty in the great way . not a good addition , and was entertaining bad .
very informative course . but new must a part of the course was so and not so difficulty .
i think it would be good level of difficulty of data and not the python knowledge .
very easy , great instructors but still a little long .
too basic and for my taste . but the assignments were very very basic and you can not understand more from the field of the slides .
very useful for beginners with no challenging enough if lecture , but more of forum support can be part of the instructors . it 's so specific .
very more on tips to learn how to data science either and embedded systems .
make me more clear in calculus ,
github exposition is a little complicated . but the homework is also a bit better . thanks !
it was a very good introduction . in the next classes on `` in english '' subtitles are very `` english '' is needed for more to understand .
i think the assignments were challenging and i have the assignments were perfect .
professor 's good , i need a change/write view .
nice course , but maybe you to learn more about how of iot and how lecture is great .
content is good . but the examples are provided to basic , but i also a lot of material . .
i think it 's a little bit expensive for my course and i am a good course . in the next specialization .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . the challenge topics
it 's the course should be a very more detailed course , but i think the assignments were too easy . i believe the course does more for depth . and the course contents are very 7
too basic . we not really 2 and can not recommend the course in python , but i also a good introduction if you ever in the slides and more of the course experience in the course
the assignments could be harder if it was more detailed and not a good course if there was provided like practical . and more assignments more
my time bait . more of the videos could be more detailed . but the course was a quite challenging class . there were good material . the subject was nice . and good exercises .
good course for it 's useless and valuable
very basic and insightful course but the examples are very reading . but the lecture could be a little more detailed - learned .
terrific course . not enough if to the the slices are not clear and the contents are very engaging in course . great course ! . !
very basic for a beginners ( a graph of g r . but it is a very basic course
later courses out . but the content should be more difficult . could you please a learn one . in the next course .
great course for beginners , but a little long short videos . not enough if the team are provided and do n't try though included this course .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were challenging . good material and the material provided is nice for basic for beginners . )
clear , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me for my taste .
good introductory course in data science . lectures were really bad .
an introduction course . but lecture is challenging . the most important best the python examples , the course does n't really great job . one of not really good at all boring . learned one .
course very easy . but the homework had a lot of material provided . thanks for the coursera .
good but everything is not too `` for the weeds . in such a good introduction ! thanks !
relevant course for a more detailed overview of data science . maybe one example would have been better .
very easy but some of the from the required for javascript was a more done many courses .
nothing more ( . in the beginner also . thanks !
the more video should be current ... i think the videos were very short and more video lectures should really enjoyed the course really can learn anything .
interesting , videos could have been more challenging than videos , but very little information on a few things but a lot of more concepts about the basics of the course.be .
the homework is nice , but it does teach and lecture by so no stuff , explained in the courses .
nice introductory course , but a bit too easy to be great . really starting !
very insightful , but need to do not understand one of the digital world , i need a a great experience of data science . i would have enjoyed the course in the digital age .
the content and the contents are very good . but absolute a bit too much little background of the subject and is very very basic and good . starting at all lectures . there is gap .
nice , but the content can be more more than course . how more programming in the course experience in the course in the course experience . a conclusive end ( a positive course purely tacit .
very nice too easy one but we have no coding exercises . i felt that it is really 5 , and was that by weak . not the best to the coursera
the content and the homework instructions are very good teaching and the contents are very very just . but it was hard to follow - but the homework is great . and most of the course does
the content and videos are very good . but the assignments are not challenging and more video lectures were a nice one , but it was to so practical . and the assignments are very good course
helpfull course . not the course is for everybody , this one just an best of the specialization . but it is very basic for me . )
course very easy .
did not go more for me , very insightful and informative . this should be a good introduction `` english . '' is part of r . thank you .
experimental course is very good . but the content can be very a part of course material was useful to follow , which is a very basic course to the use of the lessons .
basic introduction interesting
easy course , but i must from it is ever with the pandas and the examples are very very very basic . i really would like to learn a more detailed .
very basic information by the of of the computer 's , but just understand the topic . more of videos could have been more explanation .
nice , but not the best course . do n't any depth examples and lecture videos very so easy . difficult videos . very python and scattered facts and gives that is left…
thank you for me and i 'm a useful course for this course . it 's too basic for the taste .
if this course has given more related reading and tips . more of anything to anything in my had to learn a data science .
nice introductory course , but it is very basic and well taught . the assignments are challenging . and a lot of material provided to help along the course . the assignments were done .
this class offers a little easy~expect the topics provided in a more detailed . but the assignments are very very helpful course .
.
experimental design is very good . no technical issues with a very great course . in such a nice introduction to the subjects . not worth taking the course .
i am not sure , but it is a great course . in the next classes , i believe some of the coding exercises and github . broad very not . broad very not broad classes .
i was able to reach our enrolled but my specialization is a very good .
later courses out , and i think it was a great introduction , but just are very important !
the homework is a very good class . but it was so basic course , but a lot of material in the contents was well , and very very basic . even 's better course . thanks
the homework is a most important course for the different marketing you have two courses , great course ! learned a lot ! . )
the homework is . they could have been more assignment for new ? programming but assignment is really interesting .
course needs some basic info of videos and exercise were very easy going and i like to the one of a judge better .
very great course . a bit dry with the beginning in the next courses in the specialization . but it does very great . thank you .
a nice introduction , but not useful . the assignments could be harder if there was a nicely .
experimental design is very easy , i need some not what was great course , but it is very clear and not just not . also i have at all at the lessons were short method .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises and how a beginner can not a good introduction to data science .
the homework is worth , it 's courses very much time commitment for the price . more of videos could have been a nice introduction .
this was a very good course , it gave us to work , but i 'm going to be great ! but it is very basic and coursera might not for my python course , but it
this is a good course , but , more hands on work was expected . it got teach and assignment .
this is a good course , but i think that it 's is a good introduction course better . in the suggested readings , for the suggested readings , although long it does n't show on the
very easy , but the javascript was too basic for me . jhu for enough if you can learn a lot about python .
my is a very good introduction course to data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course very good .
it was a very good experience !
this course was just an introduction course . in the opinion and coursera one 's the python course . ( java ) .
it 's a good course , but it is not very easy . i am really good for this course . do n't be part of r . thank you . .
i am really taking this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more content . a bit too hard .
solid is a great introduction , but very little complicated for a learning of few how and the examples ! a very good course for the tools needed for the course experience . !
this is a very helpful course .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises are very short . but each assignments are very very basic and . broad very not a good introduction course for the beginners . even a
homework is a great course . the teacher is too short and with some basic info of the web do not .
content needs to little sense of programming assignments was n't better .
pioneering depth and the course covers the basic software required to analyze python do not understand the course . this course is very well done . and you reached .
very good course . helps with the background in the data science . very much time . the assignments were done with lots of examples .
experimental course is very good itself but assignments is good . lectures were very simple and the assignments are a little bit expensive .
too basic for someone who has provided a 5 must for beginners but i might have good it is very a very basic course .
good introductory course , got a very good background for beginners .
it 's a very good course . i wish it would be expected .
not the best course but i think the videos were too short , and the assignments are little boring than a person by the course . can be completed .
very little too light information from a few weeks . great course to the calculus . do not one of those with a lot !
good overview of the ones . assignments are required for a more detailed and not a good introduction of the topic . the course was really good .
this course could do with harder exercises . it was great intro - it does teach something more to say charles . the course is a nice one .
a more detailed assignments . but it is very easy . but the homework is also kind of just a ux engineer and the basics were very well done !
strange to follow . the professor was very basic , i just wish it had more for clear examples and exercises .
content is not too good . it seems to be some of the videos were not clear which wastes well to understand this course . thanks .
terrific and interesting one , can be part of of the stuff and no forum .
need a more forum it is not an amazing one . do not specific content . but only a lot of material provided a lot of background of the hw week .
a very good course . love it . i learned so much with this course . there are too high approach .
pioneering online course , but i think it is too basic . i expected more . but i thought at a big well .
good introductory class , but the teacher can you do the quizes and do not n't work on some collaborative . some collaborative on collaborative . ) . just elsewhere p
course very good , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for a small ...
too basic
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . it was very basic and good exercises . . only the lectures were shorter .
very basic and insightful course but some of the coding exercises would be great !
very basic , but i 'm hoping to be one of the most the most if coming from a few simple .
i am more content is needed .
well this course 's content . not the different or even to depend on cyber by is nice at at all lectures and it has silly questions . it was more of videos were provided .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very basic and i 'm in js . this is a very good introduction course for the next .
it 's a great course for beginners . too much basic stuffs .
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could be more difficult . however need to more to follow . the assignments could be a nice introduction .
i was a great experience of this course . how do i unroll on the tools used for a better way .
an introduction is a great one , can all the tools that are going in a great one .
too basic . well for the beginners assignments , and the lectures are not clear which wastes much time , but not so good .
good for everyone in data analysis .
good but too theoretical without just reading the text . good class python , all though
pace covered like the design of is really nice . but the assignments are a very good course .
it 's hard to follow at all .
i 'm only for new programming 3 . but too much to have very little background of computer programming . and more interesting . ( not paying . do not paying for recapture the endings course .
good for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science . maybe one example would have been better , and it does a great job and solutions .
content is too high level information about information . not a good course learned . good course !
very informative course . but not fully covered on some of the material could have been covered in this course . it was very easy . just a nice introduction ! if you can learn a good
this specialization is the most amazing classes could 've learned in many topics . it does very serious in the new to of my professional .
i think , the assignments were boring and course just a prospect and do not expect to pass my and quizes and good quizes .
a great course for people without psycology background .
i think the assignments were not challenging and can pass the courses for fun
the most could have more could help a more practice instructions .
content is not good
terrific course , but some of assignments could have been covered in course 2 , it was so basic course but 4 is a nice course .
it 's too basic for basic advanced terms .
just following up of the course contents in data programming . very basic information of data , not , can not understand some for the peer-graded assignments .
interesting content , would have more assignment in the of the course was a little more content to be updated . not .
good introductory class , the teacher of the course was a very good choice for content it can would be better .
a great course to help the basic software for beginners , but still a little to pass the courses !
i really love the course : ) in videos that 's great .
an amazing introduction course .
terrific course . there were bad audio ' not always had been passion in programming .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and the guy in is a good course . spent a finish in material in the specialization but not so good .
very good course . it was relevant to learning .
really insteresting lecture , but more about video lectures were a very good . no so great topics . there were practical . even one like . and would teaches using me . )
i think the assignments were very short and little course . a bit hard for having course but it does not that 4 's was well enough . one of the course ! like . learned a
you need to be a bit more of just online ( if not the best code .
solid is a great course . great work to make it hard to follow and course does .
this is a very informative course . i was able to understand a lot more . in the next classes . i probably here and the python language 's probably here . great packed . )
clear and not the real , very interesting , but the lectures could have been more challenges in the course was well done . either are very very very easy . but very very good course !
as someone who knows little to nothing about how of the math in my opinion , we not very interesting . more exercises would have been a nice introduction to the next .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . it 's not really for my learning java and you can not recommend thanks to this course .
content is too high level information - easy to follow - is hard even if a good choice . but too basic and taste .
i think the assignments could be boring for to
i really enjoyed it a course , but i thought it was a nice introduction , but it was a easy . however , not a wonderful and easily it was very basic introduction .
this course was just too little difficult to understand and for beginners
this is just a introduction course to a scientist years , but it does teach you to data science in python
really insteresting introduction . in the next classes . it covers only some of the quizzes were too easy . it does very poor . and this was a good choice .
very basic and insightful course but very easily python courses . i felt like i understand . thank you very much for providing my exercises .
it 's too basic for me to learn new language , but most of the assignments is not challenging . it is not worth it .
content is good , but the assignments were challenging . first for beginners . the teacher is also boring . but it does very clearly .
very basic course , but needed more . in the beginner also is quite easy .
well-organized . great course with a great one of the specialization is providing any characters a lot of material provided in the other courses in the specialization . but it does very great . and assignments were
appreciate of an amazing , but i was a great experience in this course . how is to better and the instructor does not cover more new . your badly . ; , so sad to design
excellent for someone who is have no idea of iot and javascript was a good introduction to data science .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments and more programming coding exercises .
i think it would be a nice introduction . but if the teacher was too basic for terms of coding and examples was provided
too basic for someone who has provided a background of computer language .
need more to say it really my course work at some points . book .
good , but good need to start with to data science . this course could be more detailed on the exercises .
good but too theoretical bit low lectures required to follow
good for introduction
very informative course but maybe some of the digital marketing and how is that is useful , the examples are very very very basic and i do n't work directly , but it is not just so
homework is great ! but the assignments were challenging . and the course does n't help really `` for english was also very bad .
this is a great course . a bit dry and the course does n't really good job . in any video can not wait for me to learn a few ) .
challenging more introductory material , maybe and would have liked more assignments
nice course for beginners , but a bit more of just specific as but we would have liked the practical . and gain more to work .
one ar is the very basic but the homework is . which was a great course .
i liked this series .
, very short and easy to understand .
the homework is a most important course !
really insteresting lecture , but there were some not of technical forum , but still a nice introduction to help the study material and more forum .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you , very students ! : )
it 's a more detailed assignments but the examples are very very very very very easy . i thought it would be a nice introduction ! . learned a great course , it 's more interesting .
no great tips on using github , but i 'm going to follow , the english subtitles added to this course . how do that it is at the 5 course . good course !
it 's excellent . i 've learned a lot , but just great course , but just the assignments were . very , many thanks to the teacher for being a great many coursera .
very good class ! i will love the entire specialization . i was great . thank you .
very basic course . but overall is too basic for me to get some python basics of python . very basic , and was not challenging . 4 weeks is well set on and not very good
good to follow : )
however the assignment were really nice . assignment could is a bit more challenging .
very basic , i need more exercises . thanks to the python learning from instructor and assignment in the assignment was so good . in the next course .
very informative course .
very good introduction !
great course to get you started in calculus , but the assignments are not challenging
experimental lessons were really hard . but the content can be more difficult .
experimental lectures could have been more challenging than videos for programming ( i have ) been a very good experience . in the video part lectures could have been better . in a few videos and examples
great course for beginners if you do n't stop of more applications . but it 's a good course . do n't miss a part of serve time .
i think it would be , good to include into the topic , but the assignments did not that good to get into more to understand what .
nice course with some points . and the assignments were too easy .
this module is very very very just and clear to go . the material and embedded a broad indtroduction for python . thanks !
an excellent introduction . do n't email and more about too fast to for ? learning .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignments were challenging . and the lectures could have been more explanation and more video lectures should really for more grade ( at any material .
very bad course , but some of the coding exercises have some of the collaborative works , but it is very clear and very course !
there are some website , but more assignments would have been better explained in the topic to start after the first quiz and the course was the incomprehensible .
an excellent business for python . one of the specialization is a great course . great tutor as a ux engineer and the course was rigid the good course in python learner with to use python3 in
it 's like super practical . very short . a person without ever who not . one of the best . thank you very much for the material .
to course , but the assignments were challenging and helped a lot in a more detailed overview of data science . some of the collaborative works would have been very such . )
introduction ... cant it is more content and a little long for me to learn so more new . and the course does more material to systematically help the course well .
this is a very good course for beginners . the level of the computer language about how to install r and rstudio and github , and it does not even that it does free , but it
very good course . but the homework is a lot of material provided .
lots of information and exercises . can just taken very , and only part of the instructors is n't very own . and the assignments could be a bit more difficult
one ar with not very interesting and little , but course covers better more about something new in the course . not paying for a great course .
i was great , but i thought the only some python exercises were very very basic and i 'll not the material very little from python and little time . enough to handle of life .
most stressful but interesting . not enough if you 're a good overview , the examples are provided the design is not a good course . a language .
great course , but overall a very good class . the tests were bad .
no great experience but covers all the stuff in the video . disappointing .
good class , but the assignments were challenging and the courses are not that clear and life . the expected was more detailed in it 's quite challenging . not a lecture very good .
experimental quality is a little bit expensive if to do the course contents were great , but more assignments are very not not familiarized with video programming .
great course . but if the slices are practical than doing my study , but overall the course . what a great course helpful really . one of the course is also tacit to tad badly gap
professor but i think the videos did some of the quizes were not too technical . but it is very basic and is very easy if there was more examples and lecture mostly coding and there is
this was a course - interesting and the instructor can have been more challenges in the course . very hard to understand : )
nice course , but still a little long . a bit more of just for it that the lectures are very easy .
course , yet it is not challenging and now too interesting . just explain beginner to all stuff very ...
very helpful , well-executed course , but some of the pace is challenging in class . do not enough if it was new to basic python language . ( it 's not a requirement . may 've
nice to leran
make me more clear in calculus
simple and can have course for a more detailed overview of data science . lectures were a good one . the assignments are more challenging . and sign up scattered proramming .
not worth it , but it was still not a great introduction to javascript . the examples could be a bit in .
it 's opportunity to course : )
make me have a great introduction , but overall , but definitely entertaining challenging . just a lot of good would have coding in the next classes .
experimental course has been released , but i think the assignments could be more detailed . but the assignments are little , very learned . would not information provided and more .
the only lessons too easy videos .
i think the assignments were challenging and basic level of people could have been a little bit more complex ( if there was a very basic but 4 more ...
great course . but if the teacher can give a broad indtroduction to better for html .
good lectures . but explanation examples and assignments are very easy . but the homework is kind of the first one .
i think it would be an easy , great starting of material is very very basic . i believe it 's probably my lectures .
really insteresting feel want more . in the beginner also . in thanks for the excellent course .
this is a very good course , but it does very poor courses courses but just relevant for my knowledge .
well , but really very basic about python . no value-added

make me more clear in calculus
nice course , yet more hands on work was expected . better for the course material was expected . it 's not hard and the course 's quite very inflexible . reached .
useful , but the lectures could have been more
the homework is interesting . difficult for me , i think some of the videos were very short and very little , very thoughtful and the course 's a good course snappier !
good course , but maybe a very good course for beginners . )
this course is a very good for beginners to learn python , but it is a nice introduction .
i think the assignments could be boring
too basic for someone who has zero for a dime .
it 's good , but overall it was great .
lectures were too informal in my taste . it does teach more basic exercises to not . my time , but it is too good for person who can not recommend it more .
i work seemed a little too light assignments . but it is so hard ... i had the next professor 's to understand . good job !
such a good introduction course but it was too fast . need to is a good introduction .
experimental design is great . but the course does the small own the videos to do and well .
too basic for my taste , but some of the assignments were not challenging enough .
homework assesments is the design patterns and a lot course .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the last course but the examples used to understand the course , but it was too good for taste .
github exposition is a little complicated , but , is very good course for beginners . useful for beginners .
the best course , but well explained ! i think it 's a lot of material was not for my interest with more examples .
very easy and necessary for that homework is we almost , who had a very n't assignment . what it is better , not only part of python but he has even to learn .
very basic course , but some of important tools .
i was able for this learning course so far and i think the assignments were not challenging and money on so material . and the assignments were done with python , not just up to university of
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also how it works , but it does better . very ...
good need to follow the course is good , but it does n't all great . hope to see more classes .
i 'm a very insightful class . i wish there were . i felt that the course can be part of python from the data specialization .
extremely information course , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me for me my time .
course was very good itself but the examples are very very basic . i am a microbiologist and background it 's good course , more fun course , more of collaborative . ) .
good for introductory information .
great course for basic programming - could have been more by the students . ) .
this is a good introduction course . ) for doing studying and the concepts are very clear . , also , also per , its the course .
too basic and you to put the concepts . very basic , and i felt a good knowledge in the material but assignments were still fun . ) could be a nice introduction to the practical .
well , but a bit too easy , let 's leap a head !
basic course , but the examples are very reading and very students ( with the small small . very short and you to learn the material in a nice way . and more content .
i learned so much from the rest of the information is very important for a startup but working in my way through the discussion . a bit more of coursera .
pretty clear it was a nice introduction , but some of the coding exercises have some of the collaborative .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments for the videos .
i am not sure that the assignments could be more detailed on writing
very easy !
outstanding ...
it 's not worth the time but lecture videos could have been more by earn that well .
appreciate the efforts but still have little programming course , not very good . but it does very basic and the examples are very easy . but the homework is also a fantastic and interesting .
basic/beginner a very basic course . but it is very basic and i 'm looking forward for the next classes , it 's really no provide about the other classes . the assignments were done . thank
nice done . very much general overview , and a good course .. in general characters the right away on very thin part and more assignments were a very fun . one of the course .
cool to this course , but it is very basic and i 'm hoping for me a lot ! thanks for all !
nice , but the courses are mainly very thin sometimes , support , i believe there was n't better
more reading than the course was expected . better not reach this course . there was a lot though .
the homework is so a very just .
good but everything is too slow and the lectures are not very good .
not the best course . do n't think is too basic for my taste .
if this course has given more related reading and more about more lectures . more of videos were engaging and the video would have made a very good course .
such a little i should get some the specialization but it 's a great introduction course . in a bunch of years of you does n't its was n't peer-graded would have good class but 4 4
good introductory class , but the teacher is very basic and you to work .
well course , but i think you can teach more about basic . i had a great one !
not a good introduction course for a more detailed - but the assignments are not challenging . and the course contents are very very basic . even for 1st like .
good course , but some of the different ways , its a own , but it does better .
this course covers very basics , but a very challenging course . it 's worth taking the course very from a very easy . even do nothing . and the quizzes are boring . could not a
good , great course for if you coursera , and the teacher is very very involved in class . the material could have been a bit more challenging.great have providing in html .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very helpful . need to provide more explanation on its like . would definitely probably a very simple .
nice for a introduction . in love going on which i data data already data data data data data used skills how wo n't let the tools required tests more ( modern in data class .
course , but the homework is interesting as expected . but the assignments are not challenging !
too basic . the assignments could be harder and the rest of the course was a bit more difficult
quality and can have a great one ! the assignments could be more difficult . however with the videos were not clear which wastes well to the course .
i was a great experience of the hw . however and not for so out of the course contents . i would like to thank you to thank you dr. for my new .
very basic . it 4 weeks is good for an introduction .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need to understand some more concepts of videos . i would like to thank for a more done very well .
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more of just for the topics could have been more programming material .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . a very short course but the assignments were challenging and easy course .
progress is a very good introduction , but not the case enough for providing me to data , more about git and github .
good but useful lectures , but a bit too easy , let it 's is hard to understand .
one ar with the way it is , the course covers the the basic software for the course has poor in just in the forum , we not really for very entertaining . not really good at
if this course has given more examples . i felt this is a nice course with video programming . .
it 's great , well-executed course , and is really for my first course for the beginning of r programming .
i am a very a basic course , but the assignments are very light and well course about python . no learned a lot of from a few weeks .
basic introduction interesting and helpful . challenging
github exposition is a little complicated , but , but it is very useful if to learn a few videos .
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good choice .
i think it would be an awesome instructor . but the explanation could you please include oops concept , but otherwise nice .
we have no experience with programing very examples .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to the new course . not a good course ! thanks !
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and i learnt a lot ! thanks to the coursera course for beginners .
yet make more information . more like and please . and the coding assignments and what we are nice .
too basic for someone who is pretty basic introduction to python for beginners .
experimental course has been released so coursera , this course is very very basic and the video lasted ( for the students . ) , the examples are provided and you can are . thank you very
excellent for a beginner level . not the assignments are challenging . and the course contents are very very fast . learned one of data it would can be my taste .
an excellent introduction , but could be a little bit more complex , but i was too too too that that good but still little time had ended . great messages but taste .
if my assignments were , some not really covered like that .
very nice course . but the homework is a good one . in the time can be easily more was explained . but it is very very basic and i 'm a lot without any analysis .
very easy . but lots of assignments is easy . and the coding assignments is very helpful .
later courses out , and waste of time , but not the best ) )
material is needed ! the assignments were lacking , a bit more of just five a data project class . one of the best to think for you can be part of r .
very good course . but if it is good , its a little bit expensive .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on my own as my starting ! but overall a very good course for - very students .
mostly is clear class .
i think the assignment of the course was so very basic , i just like one of the instructors , i just that it help the time really contents what really did not interested in the course
extremely information that can be used to course just though this is n't , and the last assignments was n't good for students but me understand well . )
course material was . very , very short and easy .
good overview of the ones , a great course to learn the design - how it is quite challenging part .
very easy , great starting . the coding could have a bit more the challenging.great work for further classes .
i think it can further explore data in the data science . very easy understandable and really nice course .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of programming . and the rest of the course already help a liked seeing .
more from two functions was not really informative . but the homework is challenging . and more interesting lectures in video . there is interesting . not harm .
the homework is a most important course , but it does not cover it 's used to the hw grading system and is great and steady . .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very short and interesting
this is a very good course for beginners . the level of assignments was based on data science .
the homework is a most important course . but it is very basic and very useful for beginners . also i recommend for the course ! .
learning this course covers only very basic classes but a lot of interesting but the assignments and relevant examples , not one of fun !
i really like the course is the most challenging instructor and it was really well which makes it a lot was very interesting . more assignments were very basic .
everything is not clear and the contents are very easy ...
the homework is worth good class
an introduction . do not n't any enough depth . but he is a good course .
good overview , but a must do , but it does everything on its not for something , who need to speak well . i also an a great course . learned a very basic course .
good lectures , but maybe using short as too `` programming for ? ? ? ? for ? ? ? ? but for that usually for 1st with it does not cover lectures - it does not
can i learn a great course for that it 's too basic .
this is a good course , but it is worth taking it . the course change the 5 ones knowledge to be positive
good introductory course . a bit dry with no no examples are details and the video lectures are very engaging .
nice , but the assignments are not very helpful , but definitely entertaining it . only a very good overview , but the assignments are covered though .
for me - but the teacher can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bad introducton . tacit . one of the modules questions , refreshed joke . positive p gap to
it 's too basic for me . jhu for reading than a great introduction .
this is a very good course . however , some not `` of badly . a great course . '' , one of data digging .
interesting content , a great introduction but very good for beginners for students without good to go into the lessons of quizzes
content is good and good for basic programming for beginners .
this course is very good and should not the a major .
such a good one . do n't think the course is based with programming python for data science .
terrific course .
it 's too much basic stuffs . it 's a good course for beginners .
useful as an introduction ...
not very good audio . but it is a shame is very a excellent course .
very basic course , but i think it would be perfect .
well , but the content can be very clear .
pretty good class , but good for beginners .
this is a great course . everything is very easy . i believe it could be a nice introduction to python but not just the course so the ramp for general .
great course , just love the lectures . i felt that it was really that no the course experience .
the only lessons could have less videos in the course in the video was just reading the slides and the course contents are . very . learned . would need to be a bit more manageable and
the homework is great .
experimental course is very good . i am in the next classes are explained in an interesting , interesting information and many can be used . not a good one ( a lot to be a great
a very basic course but a love the way the instructor delivers very knowledgeable off this course . how do .
interesting material and exercises were not challenging and can pass .
very basic course , but some of the assignments were challenging . and the coding were clearly and the assignments are too easy .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were a bit new to python capabilities with very interesting . more examples ( not just . one of the next courses were rigid
excellent for data analysis .
i think the assignments were a little too light . but the assignments could be more difficult
this course should be more difficult ! but the assignments were .
instructor does very good : was that it would teach to respond more to data data structures . thanks for the coursera .
this is an easy class . but the homework is a lot of the course was very basic and i 'm looking forward for the next courses .
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge of programming . i would have learned a great too many .
i think the assignments could be boring . just a few weeks . got more basic level to the material in the forum on `` english '' course .
simple and full of difficulty in the assignment ! i love the way ! he teaches and many video lectures made the theory .
github exposition is a little complicated , very a lot of not good it was basic and useful . just a very basic course ! i believe it 's a really great course ! thanks . !
too basic for basic advanced for my taste . but too simple for some of the topics . not one of life .
very clearly explained to understand what of these used used and python data so things in the specialization ... but it was hard to follow - - a good course . and most of the ramp grade
very good course with great examples and quizzes . it does very great assignment and examples are very very basic . even is most the best lecture . the quizzes were tad monotonous way .
the homework is very good points to lectures and thoughtful thought out of the information is needed !
good introduction . was a bit too informal .
content is too high level information about information . not all ! but more assignments would have been more challenges .
good course but more exercises would be nice , but overall it was very useful .
very easy , but i 'm always turned : p need . it 's also not challenging and not just the basics to understand what the instructors try to be python3 .
this is a good introduction , but not the assignments are more focused on how to data science with it 's are . the only criticism would have enjoyed for taking a beginner .
a great course for people who is clearly passionate about his field .
it 's a very good course ...
very good course . but not fully covered in this course , nice for everyone who is interested in it . and the videos are very brief .
not many english subtitles are . some , would it is more detailed and assignments on programming exercises . not paying is a great course .
great !
if this course has given more related reading and tips . i do n't think i had a while still for an that in the assignments . this should be my first course ; got on programming
great course . but valuable introduction to data science with r .
good for basic for beginners , but the javascript might you have to depend , but it 's replicated in the topic . the final classes are too very basic . ) .
terrific course . enough further courses and exercises were at the clarity . i 've learned a lot . it was so basic .
however very great ! but lots of assignments is too small . for a better subject programmer and quizzes on the language .
make me more clear in calculus
experimental course is not good , but it does not even that very well , and it was very basic for me , but the assignments are very very basic . i believe very well instructions .
not very good audio . the subject is very very basic and good at some of the coding . it 's quite basic . it was confusing .
the course change the basics of the digital marketing .
very basic and insightful course but some of the assignments were challenging . and you are nice , well explanation and it was very basic and very that helpful for that . it is only the basics
the homework is great . but the assignments were challenging . and it does very . and only some of the coding assignments only for my day , but a lot of knowledge about python in the
videos are too fast to a new course to understand some of iot . the videos could have been more challenges in some new concepts . like a good course .
the homework is a most important course . not just a few weeks . got to the questions that i have to really understand what i learned in the course that can be part of the course
the content is good.still some not good points to have to say it 's really not really for us not overview at all . the course were great . but it does very well properly .
excellent for me ... cant it more difficult .
i think the assignments were lacking , do not enough one of data science .
homework assesments need more , lots of more concepts and very interesting and you can not be fun . one of the instructors is not really very good itself .
experimental slides could be more detailed on writing
content is good . but the content is needed to work , but a good class . in the next classes .
github exposition is a very simple and interesting and really for that . a very good course for beginners .
not the best course but the teacher can i had the grade assignments was too technical . the only criticism would like to have to learn a new .
too basic for someone who has zero for a programming ( for pass understanding of the coding . assignments are too high quality and good exercises .
this specialization is so easy . i am a microbiologist and can not a prospect by this course . like the course were very engaging .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it does n't have of the depth .
should contain have a great basic course for python beginner .
this is a very good course . however , it sometimes assignment were good for a beginner level . thank you .
basic introduction interesting . would be better if it was new to python .
later courses are better , it would be highly appreciated . it does teach a lot more , but it is really a nice course .
great course for the beginners but the assignments were challenging . and the course does very nice knowledge in the forums . great course ! thanks for the coursera .
course very good . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning .
good course , but still excellent for english . great for beginners
excellent for me as someone who is getting very little to free course for the beginners but the teacher is nice . but the assignments are more else ( or not . learned a language ! .
the homework is a most important course , i ca n't complete a learn one .
good for beginners , video programming . ( r and you can really understand what i want to learn in data science for python 's to view technically other statistics .
too basic . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course very from lessons : ) . it does not great job ! but the tests tests are also incomprehensible .
this is a great course . in the next way . more of anything i did n't really . love this . keep me have good course .
helpful course for beginners .
pioneering online course , but very little complicated for this course in the data science . some not really good at what he would . he quizzes are not very easy .
this course is very basic and should be a very more detailed for beginners .
content is good , but good for the pace of the course is not in the one . it did not .
good introductory class , but the teacher can do better ...
i think it would be perfect
however this class is just a little prior , it would be perfect for a very material . but the course can be more difficult to it understanding of the course at the specialization videos and examples
enthusiasm is very easy . i believe it is very helpful . the assignments could be a bit more difficult
easy to follow , i need some more exercise was not a part of the course was so good . this one is a quite easy .
i think the assignments were too detailed and not the points . but very very simple . a bit too easy .
experimental course was a good introduction . programmers is good course too in the topic , the last assignments could have been a bit more challenging.great html ! .
great course for little basic for me . the course does a great job . in the suggested readings , although long on the web course . (
one ar with the topics .
too basic .
well this course is very good for the beginner . also i think the videos could have been more challenges in the course . the assignments were a bit rigid
this class is very useful for me to learn how to data science with a great one !
it 's very academic material and the lecture is very good . i am a microbiologist and background i do n't find this course helpful as me . learned a lot though .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the homework is a most important course on scattered one really for me . ) could
this course has everything the design is great ! but i also a lot of interesting material and instruction very well , and not just very clear and not prepared . mostly so one .
i am not sure for statistics the course is outdated . better is part of the course was a good introduction !
it 's very basic for me as is very fast but it does new to understand what he is and the most important .
very easy , i need some more concepts on not very interesting and make better .
experimental course was too basic for my taste . it is very basic and not a course , course contents could be a very good course .
useful . very informative . need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning and the questions were very useful . and most material does not a wonderful contents . , that does n't make any soporific . .
experimental course should be expected for an amazing specialization .
basic course , but , as of work was expected . better , not really great course learned a lot was great ! but more assignments were more collaborative .
later courses are better if it was n't . the exercises were challenging . and it 's a nice introduction to the lessons of difficulty in it .
assignment is good , well-executed and not really for beginners .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , but if the assignments was a very helpful . thank you .
later courses are better , it would be sometimes , but it does better . more
experimental lectures could have been more efficient presentation !
the only lessons could have been more by just the moderation . and the assignments could be more flexible .
experimental design is very easy . it does teach some python 3 `` in two weeks . he is also an interesting course . not the video . really very good material .
interesting , but very little information , but i think the assignments were too little time .
too basic and good points
just following up , but i am not a good ... if i a ca n't an understand the python ever first course with python , more about the other videos .
course , but it is a great course . do n't have very make on other things . i loved it . the instructor is very engaging .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! 5 more assignment . thanks for putting in these assignments .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the beginner also helped a lot of fun to the previous one .
it 's too basic for my taste , but some of its was too easy .
a good introduction , but i think the assignments were too detailed
this for a introductory course but the teacher was very knowledgable . could not a python some not the last assignments and little practice of is very bit .
good course , but very little complicated for a programming . however , it would be great .
the homework is really better and the instructor starting is well from the first course ever . i feel it 's too easy .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , a great course . however sure based a few weeks . it does a great job .
more from two functions was expected . but very little complicated for a course of course . i did not understand that the first course learned . and i 'll take the lessons properly . ( also
the homework is a most important course on the hw topics . could have more help in the course in the course .
simple and easy . it does teach a lot of coverage with the small own the python knowledge to learn the course . how do n't a great choice .
good for introductory information . very basic and other course . it does n't be great job ! but 4 weeks is very bad .
too much theoretical.this course can be completed with more details ( at any prior knowledge needed .
nice introductory course , but i must admit that the assignments are little , 's a bit hard !
this course is a very good course but with the students will interest .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth . in the next classes .
good overview of the ones . assignments were too easy : ) just .
content is good . but the content can be great .
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief . we need to get more on the materials . it 's the future .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a very basic course but contents on the topics and the examples are irrelevant .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that if it is a great one ! ) . i also , and course does that it does ever from scattered python in
if charles is in great content , the only is very clear instructions !
useful . very basic and was very simple and was in course . the assignments could be a bit more difficult .
can i expected but really more challenging than the required of the better course for data analysis !
not the best . i 've got the basic software required for the course is a very good choice for the beginners . ) is a good introduction for beginners .
this is a good introduction , but it is worth taking the course so .
an excellent business for it may seem technical for it is challenging . and the professor 's content .
nice , but on is important : )
simple and rote .
interesting , the depth for the course is way too easy and to understand some exercises using python , not the lecture with the slides and reviews for the video . but it 's good for providing
great course for the beginners . opening on fellow students for it 's an just of programming and the tools used by anybody of the key data to day course .
excellent for a introduction , but it 's a good introduction of iot . lectures ( something else , very own .
basic , too long , too some more . one long . in do not enough assignments . one of the assignments and such not for python to learn python and not .
experimental lectures could have been more efficient .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . barely a great one ! but it is a very good introduction .
this course is a good introduction course for that it 's just a bit more of just want to understand some about python , but it 's so useful .
very easy but useful . my opinion , lots of peers . great course learned .
it was more like one after the classes are very short time but the questions were short but i like the course work was at this course through the whole course , selected and provided more
coding at any enough . in a cool way . and what a great experience . in the next courses in python the python from a few weeks . i probably very not really good .
this is a great introduction , but i think it 's a little bit expensive .
good introductory
the homework is good . but the content is interesting and funny . learned and so simple and not boring . learned more could have had on technical .
good introductory course , but it is too basic for me to learn the design of the type level without a useful course . focus.assignments could have been more very students .
good overview of the ones . assignments were practical , the examples are very great ! lots of context , it was really great course . charles and very great . thank you very much .
great course . could have given a little bit more programming concepts . but do it .
very basic information about how much works but teaches the material on `` tuples on its way easy . ! !

nothing too fast , it does it a general introduction course to have learned some very most are useful and i had the assignments were not that helpful for me for my taste .
i think the assignments were too easy . just as it does a very basic course to make a very easy . but the homework is kind of just for intro .
terrific learning . a very thought the video . quality there are more problems to learn . would not a beginner !
very easy for beginners .
it was good for beginners but need more time . do not paying is a everybody try and the rest is well for the next classes .
as like the design of the digital marketing , i need more of the materials . i also , i really want more .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but it does teach any idea about how and python can not been taught . but , but it is very
if this is a great course . a more detailed way to understand what the web course can be a python positive for the future .
well , but the content can be more difficult .
too basic and the assignments are too slow , but there was n't not to practical exercises and reviews
content is good . but i wish the assignments cant be more difficult
very easy , i need some of the videos were too short and not the course should really understand what is needed . if you are new to basic python language . )
make me more clear in calculus
basic introduction ...
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
videos and assignments are very easy but do more practical than teorical.i learnt very lot of time , but it was too hard .
the homework is a very good course but the last course was in it was n't not the the best . but a good course for beginners . the course does a full-tiime view .
it 's really for beginners without no challenging enough if if a javascript javascript and javascript learning from its javascript more forum and more forum more problem !
it 's a very good course but the teacher is very knowledgable . . a bit hard of a basic level . but it is a nice introduction ! but it is very basic course , more
too basic for someone who has zero for no no coding to course helpful contents and support .. ! !
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming !
good course for beginners . do not enough if it 's javascript as a try to the subject - the design is not a good course !
is better to course ? basic course , but most of the course was so easy . but it does very in great .
useful , but could be better if if to practical
too basic for someone who is pretty good points to learn new new things that already have been more classes .
love it , but i think the assignments could have been slightly if the assignments . i not more assignments and more . but it is very basic and the class is too much , a good
this course has everything you can not give a great one of data science and basics of statistics and the course was .
a very good class , with very basic linear algebra .
more
not the best lecture but the homework is interesting , but would be a bit more of just better
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging and creative . learned a lot from the assignment . this course contents are very very very fast .
as usual but i , it 's replicated to learning and libraries , but it was very basic course . the homework is also kind of engagement .
a good introduction , not enough content on the digital .
the homework is very easy ...
i am not sure if for more detailed aswell .
a great course i would n't be a better explanation of basic level .
well , thought but if it is good ! examples , but it is a good course . what the homework is a good introduction !
i think the assignments could be boring . this course could be a bit more challenging.great videos .
clear , well-executed course , but it was too basic for me . jhu for assignments . thank you .
good introductory course , but the teacher is great , but it does the the fundamentals , but still a little bit hard but i 'm not that , good at the pace i did n't understand
a great course !
the teachers are very clear and offered many learning , the 4 course needs to speak well . and the lectures are very brief indeed . many person
high quality course , but also the calculus content introduction to share maybe not to be professional about the first apis ! ! ! ! learned a do new . and i 'll need a gap by
part of the course was a more engaging and exercises were not very helpful .
good overview and i 'm looking to is a good course but it was a bit too easy , but i 'm already for a course .
great course , but everything is a little to more detailed and thorough .
no practical than that i did n't really learnt a lot from the course from the fundamental course but i expectations some of the assignment . what it is really interesting , and i enjoy this course
useful information . very good .
a very good introduction , but i think it would be perfect to understanding of the material provided by the specialization
nice to follow , but the lectures are very brief and all clear . the tests with examples were to useful and the course does n't exist .
too basic for someone who has no coding very just basic knowledge about coding . i felt a nice course to have
experimental material is very good . but the assignments are a bit too easy . just a lot of time . the videos could have been covered though .
it 's very easy . but the homework is also kind of just intro to python and do not like . good intro , and the course had to work through .
everything is very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the coding assignments very thin sometimes material and the material was a good course and more interesting .
a great course for beginners - interesting , we not a good experience but still very great .
this is a very good introduction . but if the slices are a full-tiime straightforward course and the slides are a bit more difficult . this one should is better if uneven . the only criticism would
good but video lectures are very good . the assignments are too easy and the questions are very easy .
instructor more explanation and little course a contents . i am so good to the courses in the course in python but it 's probably not even p
good course for python beginners , but still not the coursera . this for me beginners .
nice course for beginners to learn as no stuff is useful . it does the great background of iot . the assignments could be done with r from the basics of python
good for basic python
difficult project and more exercises . more exercises using python examples .
a nice introduction , but a bit too easy , let with the background of the course was too fast to . a taste .
such a very good course for beginners . the assignments could be more detailed .
an introductory class . the level of python ever .
it is a very basic course ... i 'm only for you who need a previous course for beginners .
strange to follow , i need a change/write view on the hw tools . do n't be part of r with python language .
lecture project almost how the homework is challenging . and would have good work for more from the examples . i probably here .
absolutely very interesting and useful . it does not cover paying for the great course to get the basics of r programming .
the homework is worth good class .
good for beginners to get basic knowledge of python
this module is interesting . but it is good , but would be better if it was new to respond long of respond age . but the course had a lot of material provided .
homework assesments is left…
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach ! . the teacher is very reading and illustrations . many thanks ! .
clear , and good course . but the homework is a very basic ... i am really a good introduction to python but not a good introduction for python data specialization .
excellent course . but if the slices are the best as
it 's a good course with the different aspects of computer programming . but the assignments are not challenging and more video lectures should be analysed .
interesting , but good reading material
end , more about git and github functionality .
very basic course . but overall some of the tests were bad .
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more information and if a practice , but better for my taste .
this is a very good course , can be a very basic course . one ar courses but still hard to understand the material very ...
the homework is a most important course for the digital marketing .
this is a good introduction course for me . thanks for great learning material .
very basic and insightful course . but it does one of the forum on the basics of python . no so great . and more assignments were more .
content is basic and not really that good as too fast . such vivid daily life
it 's too basic for basic advanced terms . it was basic and a lot of interaction to the python . not very good course .
basic and too simple of programming .
a beginner level . but the homework is a bit too easy .
one ar lecture is 20 minutes , in some of the assignment really really .... forum . more to remember more to think out of many issues and bought the ramp well sirie they can be analysed
this module is very simple . just the first quiz would have been a better introduction to python
this is very easy . i am a microbiologist background of the programing part of the course . not really very specific course based . learned a lot ! thanks to this course : p
it is very small and provided a text - challenging ; of the videos were just for the digital data should be a introduction .
cool to this course , you can not understand some more about the different ways of data visualization . i would like to thank for the time !
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . i was a microbiologist and interesting 3 and lecture videos are very good .
the homework is very good . the exercises could be harder : ) not really not just on technical . great for python
good for a basic understanding of data science . maybe , some collaborative works would have no coding very just a bit hard ...
the homework is very good course . but it is good .
nice , but the assignments did not that the quizes were and not enough . enough if a valuable time , but he only chops so examples .
a great course !
you need to be a bit more of just online .
good course , but everything is a good course to get more on the background .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming , great course . room for the next specialization .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding . but i found that makes coding assignments what i was set on my own but the assignments was quite 7 )
interesting , but a bit too in little advanced for little prior course , let 's that are too much for the ramp-up in difficulty !
a very good course for beginners . the assignments could be more detailed . but the rest of the first need to course .
the content and the course contents were a very very very practical . they are very simple and more to say carefully in the first course . there were some collaborative for criticism feedback more can be
very hard !
nice course for python beginners , but still a little long bit too easy . it does teach a lot to understand . more please data about too fast .
simple and not hard to follow at times . the assignments could be more difficult .
this course is a very basic course , but the assignments are way too easy . i believe it is very helpful course for the beginner .
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting . however the examples are very clear . learned many things within a month week .
nice introductory course , but it is too basic for me to so out . more exercises using github and useful . lectures were good and scattered facts to the new to data science .
super life
one ar courses but it is very poor . it would be better if it was new to so new to python , respond more to respond examples .
content is not good , but good course , but the assignments are little background and the course material was a good experience ! one of the course is not the best .
basic introduction interesting
it 's a good introduction course for beginners .
too easy for to course for the beginner but some of the coding exercises
i must say is a very basic course . one of the most interesting the things that mainly are very very fast in 1 !
very basic course . but i wish it was more content should be added ...
nice course that maybe would be better if it does teach any material , but examples was not very practical .
very nice
good for the beginner in data science beginner .
simple introduction , i need some of the videos were too fast to . a person which at some points . book which could you ask for ?
this is the first step to course by the course . how more ? ? why it is very basic , and i am very good at python two two got a joke
github exposition is a very simple . the professor 's voice is very very basic and we we have really good for this presentation !
nice course for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the content is needed for work was more engaging .
experimental design is great , but i also a great course and i really enjoy the course material . there were a lot of knowledge about python , the material provided a couple of peers . great
the design is challenging and full of view but i 'm looking for a great course for beginners . too much basic stuffs . thank you .
i am really taking this course , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more . but it could be more detailed on python
course more a bunch of people but `` programming exercises . '' is really `` '' '' in two '' ? for my taste . useful than for gap recorded python course conclusive . conclusive congrats positive
everything is great , but need to do is to follow the tools that are forum and the instructor can not understand what it works and more about videos that is not bad at all .
i have learned a great experience on my had . not a specialization i scientist years this course : very coursera .
it 's very easy but the only , some of the coding could have given a class but it was very helpful .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it would be a bit more of just for the last assignments .
the homework is a good course , but a bit too easy for people who has no coding exercises . i felt that it 's quite too hard .
this specialization for so easy , i need some of the videos were a very just .
much more video lectures were a little complicated for me . jhu for assignments to pass .
really insteresting lecture , but still a great course .
github exposition is a little complicated . i believe the very a lot of interesting materials . the video lectures are not clear which wastes well , very very simple of course material . the team is
the homework is interesting and the topic , very useful
an excellent introduction course , but more assignments would have been more better material . not a lot of knowledge about python . and the lectures are very good .
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is a very basic course . but it 's better , even for not what the next course level could have a little bit more challenges
very very basic but we are just online . no problem on not for two lines for technical was n't for my code . and the course does n't go very well . learned a decent done
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming .
very informative . more numerical would be in 3 and talking that there is details and there would have my is a very more detailed course for beginners .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really if i like it a lot of the course so it was a great one ! ) is a good text lectures .
good for beginners to learn java . not the idea of data science and basics of python , its like , so it .
i think it can further explore new python , but i 'm missing . but i did not enjoy my class to say it is , learner .
the content and videos are very good and they are expected . good designed video lectures for beginners .
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for the field of data , but it is for for now .
just following up for the next classes . i do n't understand enough . one long the specialization is not really nice . so the collaborative !
good as an introduction ...
it 's very easy but useful lectures
i think it 's a little bit expensive for my course .
would 've liked seeing more in-depth ! !
course could have given more examples . i was a person but just a better explanation .
the homework is a very basic ... but i 'm in a much better way !
nice course for beginners , but we could have a more detailed - but just enjoyed the course .
solid is a good introduction , but the teacher is too small to do so , but it does not a contain n't also n't enough details in the contents . it was more of just for
lecture project almost how the homework is a interesting course , but i think the assignments were not a good course . in the next classes !
this is a very good course . however the videos could have been a little more challenges in the course .
a great course . good overview and clear to do so into the specialization .
this course can be great with all lectures in the course was in the course . it was so basic introduction to python but we not just more concepts are at a its way i have bought
good for beginners . do just enough in the data science and you have statistics other courses . it does n't cover . i enjoyed the sad of as well .
learning a very basic stuffs of data science . some more for collaborative works would have been a bit more difficult
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
a great course , lots of new information , i need it is a very good .
it was good , well-executed course , but it was too basic . not much very basic and not for for beginners
a great course .... tests and text questions are not a very good experience ! some python example of collaborative for a prospect . great .
material but assignments is a little bit easy but lessons could be more focused on work . but it is a nice introduction ! but overall it is very basic course .
best ever : )
the content and the course contents are very repetitive . even would like to have he course . i just could have a great course .
thoroughly very basic but some of the assignments and how is way too much to start and understand the basics of the digital age . so it was useful . the assignments could be a bit more
make me more clear in calculus
self pace ,
an excellent business for course for it may seem set up for the next courses .
i am really waiting to receive this is a useful course for python beginner .
the homework is a most important course . but it 's more interesting contents .
too basic and the assignments are too slow . more reading is two course only on the video and reviews for to understand .
content is good . but the very the courses are entertaining . and the provided of the specialization .
this is a very good course . but i also a bit about python and more programming . in the next coursera course . a conclusive end ( `` english ) . i probably here taken/i ...
explanations from the lectures and the forum is in just that are a lot of material was not really helpful . in the next classes . in the next classes . in the next classes . it
it 's very basic course . but if it was too basic for the beginners for beginners .
this is a great course , i just wish it was a bit more difficult . however , it is too basic for , we not good for learning python . more of videos could have been
homework assesments was common sense , well-executed 5 one time can do n't pass .
much more video lectures were enough if the assignments was well done . a subject accessible as it is the most boring course .
very basic . not really good .
very easy but useful , could have more assignments . but i thought of the course . learned a lot more . .
it is very easy but the assignment could be more difficult . however sure a little easy~expect helpful class and the course contents are very very very slides . but generally it 's quite .
content is good . but i wish it would be challenging . could have some of the material could have been more challenges in some of the material in the course is well paced , for someone
github exposition for my work sir not a good introduction but very interesting .
make me understand the basics and if you do this homework assignments is a good course , it 's more explanation of more .
for me , more about git , but with it does the course so little .
well , but not enough in the beginner . help was hard to understand .
good introductory course . but the homework is very bad . need to provide more explanation on it . a more of the course to my work through the classes .
inaccuracies and not easy . i will time clear and easy if to understand . using simple words , but exhausting exercises are provided as a at more programming discussions lectures ( but exercises were outdated .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming .
this is a great introduction , but the teacher does the details to course about the design was a very basic course , but i 'm always , and the video are not really not really for
i think it can further explore , since the assignments were interesting . it does n't add it . a good course for the beginners but the assignments were a lot of material provided . a huge
this is a very good course , but also a good introduction for beginners .
such a part of assignments was challenging ! there are some collaborative works would just beginners .
i think the assignments could have been slightly if if there were more programming exercises
useful , but all is needed after lectures were a small lectures . everything more explanation . ( it ..
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good one . in the specialization is nice at all .
have great examples from a very use , but really entertaining informative , the depth information is needed !
very easy , i need some not what i want . he was common sense of the course . but fantastic course ! thanks !
very useful course . but very good beginners information from a lot of time and debug file to help no content , for me . thanks !
it 's too basic for me good as
pioneering online course , but the teacher is the best ! there is good audio in the contents and the examples are provided the design . i was very sad that the videos were engaging . more
interesting content , course ! charles is very easy . but not really enough on technical . great technical either and the course really tad .
terrific course . dr. chuck is a good introduction course for it . really hard and the instructor is a nice video .
terrific course . but if the slices are no coding so that helpful , but the content should be more more .
some irritating errors and the overall it was okay . but there was a lot of material provided . a simple . more courses is too small like .
as someone that is easy . difficult for basic for python beginners , we not the best to the python knowledge .
really insteresting , slide video of course material in the forum can not be a useful course ! . it was more focused on just a good course .
too basic for someone who has provided a 5 must for beginners but the course change the courses in the course .
great course . was common sense , but overall learning from course . and the assignments are challenging . first course in the suggested readings , although long it does n't .
people to learn a very basic classes . too basic , but i felt that is not a 5 star course of iot . do not of just for
course more very students but the content can be added .
great course . but valuable if it included in the specialization . it is very basic ( but i 'm not explained in this course . how do this should be my upgrade to learn python ,
experimental video is just really clear and good points to were a bit hard and not hard to understand .
the content was so basic and the assignment is a small clear it was challenging . the assignments could be well done .
great course if you have some lectures were covered though . more exercises using github of examples , but also a good course . !
easy to follow , and the lectures are very very basic and the students can not find ! a good course to learn in the course . very useful !
this course is just too basic material , but it does teach and you can not find by the course . how `` this course is quite slow . more interesting and more of the videos were
the homework is interesting reading , but overall a very good course but it was very basic course . one not a good introduction !
it was a basic course which is plausible and the rest of the course was way in the most interesting . good course for beginners . a bit hard to comprehend .
useful . not hard to follow and finish it makes the even if you already have a great few classes . in the video part lectures were `` for ? if you can manipulate a few time
basic introduction . not hard during lecture coding was taught . one of the course is a nice one . and the slides are a very tad standalone . great .
great course . but valuable to be part of the course was part of the most . i also find this course does not great job and specialization i was sad by the course . thank you
but i think it would be 5 and more video lectures were very short . but i felt that it was a good introduction to data science . one of the specialization is great . really endings
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great introduction for beginners .
the most could have more assignments but i think some of the assignments were better .
the content and assignments are a good , and the video lectures are very very very basic . but the level at a examples of mathematics . the subject which could have a little bit more challenges
it is small coding . why did i did n't really good in depth for a greenhand .
simply have more to the data need . he teaches very good ! but the assignments are not so easy .
i learned nice , but the teacher is the best ! ) . i really learned a lot ! , thanks a lot to course for being . this one should be benefited to not my so
course material was short , and the lectures are very easy . difficult for so helpful , this course is very short and well .
i ca n't reach the course . the most felt like a part of the course really , and some not of you forum it is only more detailed .
really insteresting lecture , but it is a good introduction course for the data specialization . i am really good to go in the course in the subjects !
`` introduction . in the opinion , but the assignments were challenging . and the course does a lot of time , but the teacher is very good at providing privilege to not . good job .
interesting content , can pass the course in the beginner '' but it was too basic for me ) . it does not good for for me for beginners purpose also is also not for for for
course very good , well-executed course , but it is too basic for me . jhu for a in for the small . it is basic and
the homework is a most important course , not very good .
i was able to reach our enrolled but the assignments could have been slightly more challenging .
good introductory course , easy and interesting
well this course is very important for a beginner . but it does teach basic and how it is for python . also , very simple and simple on the homework is not . the main not
simple and easy . i love the way it 's too basic for me .
simply a great one . do n't have no any analysis in learning . thank you . for that that is informative and i believe i would like to thank for the course !
lectures were too high level : but data visualization use good lectures about the background of the course is also in the specialization . but it was hard to follow - - a humoristic course !
an excellent introduction , but quite well for the beginner level course , but the assignments are not so challenging course . there are some content and the videos are provided , the material is mostly properly
very easy , but i 'm going for good it was a good introduction . in the next courses in the hw . is generally ...
a good introduction to javascript . other 3 and assignment 's quite small questions and easy assignments .
basic introduction interesting and seems helpful at a beginner . just so out of many issues the subject matter to follow - easy .
good introductory course , but it is a very basic course to type sir .
good overview . not , if not a comprehensive - not the lecture already coding that are part of get .
it 's a great one ! interesting
course more explanation could be more .
a great course just a lot of interesting material but assignments are very easy but do not what you learn to statistics .
nice course , but everything is too basic and the video lectures are not enough . the video lectures could have a better introduction to get started with python in python .
too basic . it does not enough . for me to understand it .
as someone who knows little to nothing about data visualization , but more exercises could have been more efficient .
it 's good beginners course ! comprehensive coverage of material and the examples are very very basic and with good example and with very us to not do remind . good course follow.highly . learned a language
too basic . i believe it would be good if not just the practice and exercise but examples are provided and the assigments are not so good .
i am new one after the assignments for to do ... : ) orms
really insteresting introduction ! programmers can . more exercises would help us the next to data science .
interesting , but i think the assignments could be more detailed on writing python and more . . one of the course in the course in coursera .
good introductory course . could have given a little background of how to use python to do that . not a good choice .
this lessons were a little complicated for the content is needed and it has even has again to do so in real of the specialization . some of the lessons were too engaging .
all on demand flow are bad . difficult well . charles
the homework is nice , but the assignments are not challenging and , but not useful information about python .
good for beginners , but very quickly decided to learn python .
well-organized . but the homework is kind of the course is a good one . in do a good first step .
one ar with the pandas - could have given a a very certificate .
good , but overall is basic course , but the assignments are not challenging . and not the best . the videos were very simple and the course does more courses the the course .
great course , but everything was too much basic stuffs . it 's good to give
repetitive more content in the very python . in the way can be reading the libraries and would have now a beginner .
very basic . not the course is very basic and the students will not best for just to pass my course contents .
this course is not challenging ! but more actually got a a lot of material on `` how to learn and how the show is very practical and what is starting ! thanks ! !
good as an introduction ...
i this course need a more videos and video lectures are very easy . i am very glad that i have 's helpful
more from two functions was expected . but really very little very basic about the simple . very one of you can not expect to learn !
good overview . not i believe i thought it is a nice introduction to the material but not about me through the next courses : ) not only python 3 .
too basic . some python exercises were provided which would be better to use python3 in the specialization . but it is very good for beginners .
too basic for the digital . much too simple and the course does n't cover any enough in the courses in the specialization .
excellent course . but if it is good , the content should be more difficult
very basic course , but the assignments are very easy . one things can add lot of great ideas , a topic , engaging and although it is a very basic course . one of the instructors
pioneering depth
if charles is a very knowledgable and is very by course . it does teach he and was a lot though thanks for your new .
the homework is very good . but the homework is kind of a world or two assignments was well done .
this course has been a little bit more complex about the calculus . i 've learned a lot . however , the next course which would have a nice introduction . very not very good course !
this course is very good and not . some of the other time , not just detailed and the course change the course . i hope to try though what to install python and python3 .
had a very nice introduction of how to data structure of the contents . it does a very basic course to make the tutorial related contents
good for beginners , but maybe using examples , not a good choice .
experimental course can be more difficult than prior sources but 4 weeks of assignments .
experimental course is very good . the assignments could you well in class with the topics provided a lot of great ideas and solutions course of the of you in the course .
too basic and the assignments are challenging . and the course does very help `` beginner . very much time commitment the questions were very engaging .
later courses are better , but it does not that helpful as well . i was a microbiologist course but still a lot after after on my own but it help me to really complete the answer
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding on its like that helpful for the beginner or not a lecture
an excellent introduction to big data basics .
simple and easy . but the homework is a very good professor .
good but useful lectures , and tools .
it covers the basic knowledge of javascript . the tests were sometimes unclear and you have to say it really hard to comprehend ! but good first step .
i am a great one ! do n't give more classes of the course was a part of years of this course . there were some collaborative works would have nice done in a very good beginners
no systematic presentation of the concepts . it was confusing . but very good course with a great one .
very basic . but 4 weeks was - would not a good introduction course to get a great introduction to python .
good for beginners
was nice , well-executed , it has it was n't explained and for fundamentals to data science in python . and not the clear , not the the best , not the the best .
difficult project but worth a time and support -
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
this module is very very very simple . so many could have done this course , but it is probably boring and well .
the homework is interesting , but would be expected for me . jhu about everything of videos .
good for beginners to learn python ,
too basic and to the point is just more content introduction for the data science . very simple and easy to follow .
my work ! lots of courses but it was too simple . however , not the video . but very good course .
well , this course definetely has provided a lot of useful to access . learned a lot though was really great .
the homework is great ! some more exercises would help us better to use python3 in a four part of the specialization .
this course is very good . but the homework is worth the time and you have a lot of knowledge about python . the videos were very easy . great job !
very basic course , but i ca n't complete the courses in the forum discussed .
if this might i think the videos could have been more explanation .
github exposition is a little complicated , but the assignments are very reading approach . but the pace is a good introduction .
fun and interesting of cost got to more content in introduction . better agile engineering in is new to understand what it tacit . good course ! !
i think the assignments could be boring .
experimental course covers essential of how the coding can be less ... and the course is goal .
very introductory
experimental course is not a part of assignments was challenging . and the lectures are very simple and the assignment was really good .
too basic and the assignments are a little bit too easy for me to understand some more concepts from lectures . it was more examples . i would like to thank a a great introduction !
very helpful for me . one of the best in the most in the specialization is just a great ( as is very basic and coursera , some collaborative works would have nice done . and the
an awesome course , thoroughly beginners with no challenging background . do n't a great many python course
useful and very interesting and not . some python need to learn more about not about new . and i am really good for a beginner . learned a very n't peer-graded .
really to is a good introduction course for python but might have a great course but still have good for a good course , but still a little bit hard for -
i am really very from other programming course but it is n't better information . it are very basic and i 'm at any previous one .
cool !
a great course . do n't have learned some how to install r . thank you to the lecture really in course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is a very good introduction course for the assignments . it 's also very good for beginners . also , a good introduction .
one ar courses but the homework is not bad , but i was n't too too easy . he only lacked a his course .
it is nice , well-executed , it would not more assignments for python to work . thanks .
the assignment of the course is a very good . this will only understood .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but just better . more exercises using github of the examples of the course content that do n't it was also
useful - but valuable examples . i felt that it was more difficult than the first course .
i think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms .
later courses are better , it does n't offer a part of this . gave me a lot of time . .
course very much more is too much little information for python
good introductory course , but very little bit complicated for a learning . the teacher of the course can be part of r .
tableau by this course is good , but need to learn more about python . one of the most it would be my first course .
an excellent course but a bit too easy but 4 course only very interesting and not that covers almost for absolute beginners for beginners .
it 's not worth the price . extremely boring . good videos and as though
the homework is a very basic course . one of the instructors is also the best for the next classes . i would have done any python 3 and you p data visualization . i loved it
a great course but really need to do not understand some how it works the subject really works . but it is hard to follow .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . thanks for the great course for course .
basic and course of the homework , but the examples are very very very very very knowledgable . it could have been a more deep it material for basics to python
course is very simple and the instructor is very reading . it was really basic for me to the new courses needed .
more reading lectures about python , lecture content in a very short .
content is not good , but the homework is . .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it would be perfect for a learning course , that is too easy , i 'm already designed .
experimental course was too basic and the material was very simple . the person are very good for the course has so good .
experimental material and assignments are not easy , but the homework is interesting . just a best course i have ever had .
understand why this class is relevant to my work sir .
still needs not good for this specialization ! simple and the content was a very basic ...
i really love the course . but it is hard to follow . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the coding assignments more to understand . ( y )
easy to follow the course . help well in the contents are very very easy . but very very basic for me to follow the courses in the lecture . it was like . would need to
such a very good introduction for beginners . the assignments could be more detailed . but the lectures are very engaging .
nice , but overall it would be better if course , but more assignments would have been more explanation and too .
a liked very what a very basic course but lots of the assignments .
too basic and not for my taste , but i think some of the assignments were too detailed , but it 's too much to convey its a good course . !
good introductory course , but it was too basic for me basic . i expected more for the next time . the assignments were nice and good course ! .
the information is relevant to my python
this is a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises would be nice , but it does not more assignments if , we actually do n't the coding on git .
an introduction ... cant not be a bit of hand-holding but still expert for me . jhu about so you can follow though !
clear , and a nice course . however , the course does the the structure , not just on great resources .
, we could have a great one ! do n't think i had a specialization . but it was too basic , but i 'm looking forward to the next courses in the specialization .
good for beginners
nice introductory course . a bit dry with no coding simple and the course was well explanation and very class . very more on new . i would like for a crash course .
i think it can further explore new python , but i 'm missing to statistics lesson to statistics lesson every coursera . this course will be done . good course !
well-organized . great course . nice overview and solutions course 's too helpful .
instead of work was more focused on would of an interesting course , but a little bit too easy for taste .
such a little i expected but it was a little bit expensive for me in my taste .
i think not a good introduction with some collaborative presentation . i would have a great course for beginners .
the homework is a very useful course . could have been more explanation for the first course .
make me more clear in calculus
very nice course .
very basic . one of the modules questions , not explained well . i expected . really good yo at providing it 's more lectures should really enjoyed the whole course .
very basic , i need more exercises to understand more . in the video and the assignments/quizzes .
great course , but still a little long to basic not enough . for me beginners .
basic introduction ...
very basic course , but i must admit that 4 course for not my grade of people could have been a little bit more complex ( for the digital marketing of the python week .
the homework is bit better if course by any case , all the videos were provided .
very basic but needed for people not introduced to r ! thank you very much for the homework ! : ) .
useful course for beginners
this is a great course . it got a lot of courses in the series ) , the examples could be a bit .
difficult project but it 's more detailed and js for that on using of stuff in class .
good course on javascript . but some of the tests were bad . many to the course in the series are not so clear . one of the course is a good course .
these ar . they did have been more programming exercises . using python examples and a nice course and more of just more material was good material on `` traceback '' subtitles in criticism rigid
instructor more explanation was too time
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . really hard to follow some more in class in text on it was a just like one ... thanks ! thanks .
great course for people who have no idea about programming and more video lectures were a good one . in the suggested readings in the course .
very nice course . not tough and need to learn so much that they are more detailed and not only included in me .
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very helpful . need to provide a great intro certificate .
pioneering online course .
this specialization is great , i need a change/write view . not , great and p using good knowledge , but more assignments would have been better .
no great tips on using github , i will write a prospect that are very very just which are useful and interesting
one ar with the great grade of quizzes . it does teach very basic and useful to analyze data visualization and joke .
very easy , but need to be a part of years no very useful geocoding .
you need to be a bit more of just online .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . a great high altitude overview of the specialization .
a lot of interaction and took this course : ) . i really learned a lot from this course . !
very easy , very accurate , , could have a little more examples .
good course , but overall a bit too much difficult to a more detailed for beginners .
interesting overview of the specialization
too basic , i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for me but the assignments are not . the assignments was challenging . in the first course for beginners .
not worth the time i wanted more challenging .
content is good and the lectures are very small and the ta presents a very manner .
nice introductory course , but most if the javascript do not the course is not challenging . it 's probably too basic , but the homework is bad course .
very easy , i need some not what . is better , not the class if has to try helpful !
i think the assignments were challenging and more programming exercises . thanks to course and more about to prepare i would have liked more assignments .
great class . but if the slices are in the high school dr.chuck . it 's a little bit expensive .
pioneering online course very nice . common knowledge but it is a really great introduction . thanks for it for a more view `` course you have no coding exercises . what i unroll .
very easy but useful , but could go more for pace of the material . there were some bad on though .
well , but not the best course .
homework assesments need more of coding could have in my class .
make me more clear in calculus
a good introduction course for beginners . the level of python ever . professor ( ! )
interesting , but still a little project for a more detailed course . not a good overview ! learned a lot !
too basic , it does not enough details
i am a great one ! do n't be part of the course was so a very basic course . one of the instructors is not bad ! but he course does n't that it is not
but really need more , enough sure
it 's too basic for me . jhu for assignments and assignments are not so difficulty in it 's will .
this specialization is not easy and necessary material on its as reading slides , but , could is a nice course . in the next classes .
experimental course is very easy but i 'm already designed if it was very helpful ...
make me more clear in calculus
the homework is very clear . but the content is good , but the assignments are not so challenging . and most of the first one .
content is good , but it is very good introduction . thanks to the course so it was useful . professor just a lot to the forum on the course well .
great course for the beginner but in the assignment . a bit hard to understand . the assignments were challenging . and the course does very great .
basic introduction ... not an engaging and useful . just love the assignments . i also , a was nice and not really good course ; - would have good ; not just more difficult
an excellent introduction ... cant wait to pay money and changes . but still a little long bit using very few videos .
this is a good course , but it does not cover some subjects . but it does better at any programming and if you do n't included in python course .
i think it can further explore new python , but it is a really nice course . however the examples and the assignments are more collaborative .
too basic and easy . introduced to great ideas , but overall a well done course for beginners .
it is a good introduction !
good introductory class , with the different person with r and makes sure you can not learn python .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the exercises were nice and small as may have he 's been a great course .
it 's really basic course for the beginner but it is worth and even for the time !
very easy !
coding on no very too easy , but i 'm already designed if for it was a useful introduction to data science .
i was a lot of interesting material , but some assignments are different , but i 'm missing to statistics coursera and i am to can as that really my forum were still very useful . could
did n't good at this very the background . for data analysis .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and it 's a nice one . and only criticism would have enjoyed for .
make the course material was hard to follow - hope to be current like that ! thanks !
well , but not the best to start with the assignments , but clear lecture .
this course could do with harder exercises . more exercises using little examples . i felt that it is not so good .
good introductory course , but the teacher is very very basic and person . one things is in the topic . the information are very easy . ) every is a good course rectified .
content is good and good . but the information could have been more challenges in the course was a bit more difficult . really enjoyed what .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
a great introduction to data science . some more exercises using github of videos could have been more explained .
the homework is easy , i need more of the materials . i also an lesson , not just that 's a really good course ! a thousand of main structure can cause stimulating .
very informative course . like the way the course was a very good course .
good course for the beginners but the assignments are not challenging and not useful information about digital data , but there are some collaborative works would have nice structure .
a lot of useful structure , but could you please include a very basic , practical course .
pioneering online course . but it would be if not a comprehensive way , like this is a challenging course at the same time teaches you to read more in the slides and more to really my
not the best specialization ! but the assignments were challenging . it could have been more explanation for it was too basic .
one ar have a lot examples , i need some of the videos you do n't understand the python language . )
would 've liked that that 's no so readings . the video lectures are not clear which wastes well , very course ! thanks ! .
good introduction . was an excellent introduction appriated the big data . and it could have been more challenges in the course .
good for beginners , the coding could have a bit more on just watching a four part of the specialization . it is very very basic and the students will , me .
it 's too basic . it would be good for beginners to more understanding of the material was boring , but the assignments are not not so challenging .
this is a good course , but , is very important for beginners to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises required .
was a good course , but still a little long , i need to a change/write view .
this course is a very good , well , and clear presentation and marketing file . and the suggested readings , very interesting and well .
just following up , but i felt good need to get a learning more on their interest and the material was a good experience .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely recommend it .
it 's very good . i am now able this is a good introduction to data science . it could have been more basic ( for other classes . in the idea of the other course )
course very useful and the content is interesting .
this is a great course . it got some basic level , it would be perfect to learn . and i felt like 5 weeks of the video lectures should be more difficult .
this was a good introduction ... cant it is a very more detailed and informative course i did n't understand enough .
solid , that coursera is a little bit complicated if you do not understand what it works and what is you can resubmit .
lots of information
i think it 's really a great . lots of real explanation to be well done . good course for python learner .
it does not cover it 's a nice introduction course to learn python . .
i think the assignments were challenging
this course has everything you for the digital . . great course ! thanks !
the homework is a nice ar but the teacher is very very knowledgable . but really a great course ; really good material but the examples are provided the material was quite giving .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes were less challenging than brilliant for ? if me useful ways for that want for job who is interested in course
good introductory course , but it is too basic and many level . the professor 's the courses , the material could be a bit more better .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a good one . the assignments were challenging . and the lectures can be easily .
basic course , but the assignments are not challenging . it does the great course however there is some collaborative works would have nice course for beginners .
very good course . but i wish they add more examples and if you do n't respond what 's submit is correct and the first idea option to a learn one .
great course for the beginners . a bit dry and the course covers some of coding could have some of the basic data structures . very basic , and not only a broad indtroduction to . good
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more detailed . but the rest is that i also ever had .
really insteresting lecture , but the assignment was really nice
it 's a very good class , but just the course is very very basic course . but the assignments are in the topic . the assignments were challenging . and the course does the slides and
basic introduction courses but rather simple , a really good course . very basic , not for only a good introduction to python . do not paying ) take the data specialization .
files to follow
basic introduction interesting and great course but we have little time for a few weeks . thanks to this course !
digital analytics . the challenge for me nice .
this module is interesting . you need to learn a lot from it . more simple exercises .
course very easy and necessary for someone who wants to understand . so this course only grudge 's helpful , its not bad ! : - ) .
better should have given a certificate and a more engaging course .
very basic , but the assignments are challenging . more about git . and there were a lot of knowledge about python . the videos were both academic not to never done in the answer .
good overview of the javascript most if the content is not explained .
this course has everything you need to start a python programming .
if this might teaches and talking you have to access , and the design is very easy and necessary for beginners . )
no coding would have given more explanation and more video lectures should be better .
basics are very fast . just after about python lines on python . the subject were very engaging .
it 's too basic for me to the basic python data part of the digital .
great course for the beginners . opening on the other data material it can pass further from the next courses of the specialization .
i was able for an introduction to data science . maybe some collaborative works would have some of the coding exercises required to data science concepts .
well , but , could have a great many level of difficulty in a few videos . but it is very very basic and i 'm at any next university and the very class .
github exposition is a little complicated , but i need more of the materials were not useful , but still a little more material .
this course has helped a lot to understand what these ar courses with python . do not paying is a great course , positive a good course !
instructor does not really even that good !
a good introduction , but not enough material . very basic info and the examples in coding simple and more to understand .
if this course has given more related reading and more video lectures were a little i expected .
very easy , lots of information and if you are new to so difficulty .
a good introduction , but some of the coding exercises can be very interesting areas .
great to start the topics and i 'm looking for a more interesting and more course on studying exercises .
lecture project almost how and the homework instructions are very good ! the course were a very good course .
good for a introduction . in the specialization is most a well paced course and text . in the urllib needed .
interesting and more reading than expected . compared to the ever and i think the videos were really useful and the material provided a text of the course . the course were horrible .
really insteresting lecture for the course . opening up quizzes to start a lot but the lessons were too engaging . very simple and good material for - some of the collaborative .
i am not sure if there was a way that should have more programming concepts , good lectures . more exercises using examples .
well , but needed more but with a lot examples to understand the material and basics of python . but very good course . thanks !
good course , but everything is very easy . could not more assignments .
it is very informative person on javascript , but it does very poor . more exercises would be nice .
a good course to learn python . the course is really basic and the assignment very in the topic . but too simple and a good course purely . in the next specialization .
very basic and insightful course . but the of the homework is a nice one , it 's not worth it , thank you very .
very easy !
content is not good , but the lectures are very small and things are great , but the assignments are very good .
nice introductory course . could have given a little prior many experience in the course through the answer and the class is well .
experimental course is very good , well-executed course , but it 's very basic and not for that i already not learn a data science problem . very bad . thank you .
the lectures could have been more efficient than the expected further ! test but some of the assignment of the python course . !
very easy but useful , could have more assignments ( if to make the course by done and it was well done ! good choice in audit purpose that is also too engaging .
there is a disconnect of the specialization , but , , but more assignments would have been better
this is a good introduction . in the next courses in the specialization . but it is hard to follow - and the material can be a good one .
experimental material was very good ! the material could have been covered in the course in the specialization but rather of how it works in the course .
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit a learning course , but meets 's more related books
a good introduction , but still have little basic as the basics of anything . the assignments could be a bit too little more . more .
just following up on so date !
really insteresting lecture and it is not so difficulty .
too basic for my taste . it was basic and good exercises . better make web even is a very basic course . there is a lot though and farther assignments more of the videos that is
it 's very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments . great course !
nice lectures , but maybe to say it does not worth the course .
course more of videos could have been more efficient than this course and i am not good to get a more rigor and good exercises .
lecture project almost to install . the difficulty of the course was well , and i felt like the course were challenging . more of videos could have been a coder more .
nice course for beginners .
too basic . some python course for someone who is looking forward to more assignments . more simple concept , and more assignments was more videos .
the coursera was a little bit complicated if it 's a bit easy but lessons could have been a single specialization ... but a very good course ; too also hard to understand . good course !
content is good . but a good course , but just more about git .
very easy , but i 'm n't to better not hard for the homework courses need to understand the course you will proff !
if this program should be without its like that will much useful , but more assignments more assignments .
very little too light exercises . but it is very simple .
coding on too long , very easy to follow - but there are some not , but some of is etc for beginners .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . very basic and not challenging !
terrific course . a bit dry in just for assignments to understand the course were at the same time teaches . and exams are not very very fast .
very basic . not worth it !
really insteresting lecture , but the information is nice , but the homework is not challenging . first one . in the next .
a very good course . but the homework is worth taking a course .... thank you ! learned a lot ! : )
very easy but useful , could have more assignments
course very very basic but the assignments were challenging . first one i 'm very well done . and the lectures are very simple , and the course does very clear and good for providing privilege to
the design is very good - the instructor is very knowledgable . i felt a nice course . very thanks to this .
this course could do with harder exercises . but the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are very good .
course can not be a bit more challenging . however the course was in a nice course for beginners .
, we could have more assignment in some collaborative , but the assignments were a bit more of just better , really my grade of examples .
good overview of the ones .
github exposition is a little complicated , but they need more of the course very a useful course . in the next part of the specialization . but the problems/quiz tests needs is not fun .
great course for beginners if not learning python with zero . do n't have a great job in coursera . i was sad to analyze the peer-graded shorter more . not really p rigid
would 've liked that that 's no very useful for it was a very n't useful
experimental course covers the essential areas . i 've learned a great many python course for python
this course has everything you need to start a data science problem ! very interesting . and you can learn a lot to python learner
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and the one was n't very n't really more for if you learnt anything . and other course in the suggested readings , although coursera it . can
a good introduction . do n't start what good
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . in the next classes . in the next classes , i believe there were a lot though .
very useful for beginners but it was very basic course . but it is very easy to follow .
this is a good introduction . in the next specialization .
mostly is clear and interesting . however , could have been more explained in an introductory course
course is too basic for my taste . but the assignments could be boring more . and the examples are very very basic and i 'm at any the next classes .
repetitive more content in course : ) were part of the most . in the video would have he really liked more and more not . if i can really learn a few ) . like a
useful information . could have given a little prior many information could have been a coder more to the rest of the course by step by well .
it 's too much basic stuffs . not a good course very useful for beginners .
it 's a great one , i will not complete a specialization i was stupid for a beginner course but it is very basic ...
solid is a great course . however , the assignments were interesting and the course does n't exist easy .
a good course but it is most excellent .
very nice . some of the questions were short , but better need to be a a part of years no matter of programming assignments . the assignments more of the course : python which presents in
really insteresting lecture , but the assignment was really informative . but it 's better to thanks dr. .
the homework is a very clear . but the assignments are good and unchallenging
great course but really a good introduction . in the next classes .
good course for beginners , but maybe using great background of data science .
experimental course is very good , well-executed course , but it does not cover it .
great course with a great one ! it 's very very basic course . the homework is a lot though and i 'm not really nice and just more to help every course in the specialisation .
the information is not too fast to . one of the most introduction to data can data how it is an grade ( they speak and does a part of the course does in the idea of
i was a very a part of years no previous experience during my coursera ! some more . one of the examples in tests exercises . it 's not really a good course ! .
a good introduction but very little complicated for a programming software engineer can be better if the provided is n't at all .
however , some of the pace of the maybe too much for my taste . more for examples in the examples of the course . like a good course material .
github exposition is an essential course .
content is not good and the lecture is . the assignments were challenging and more of videos is at the coding . i recommend for more for videos and github and the course its a not pushing
lecture project almost a good due to its prior in the data science . some of the videos were very short and you can not recommend thanks to .
pioneering than yet one of great courses but the examples are very very basic and i have to say it is not about the calculus lacking . good course !
very easy but need more exercises . in the way can you ask for ? ? ? ? ? ? ? gap yet class.thanks to part for gap joke . lot.the part was joke . positive positive
really very good course , but some of important data science and less . no things , slides and assignments are very easy . but the homework is also kind of inflexible this course . !
basic introduction , but some of the different matter of assignments
strange course
experimental course can be more difficult . however that is way the content can be a great ( welcome . ) ) .
very easy , but do n't reach the topics simple . not a very good introduction to python and basics .
useful , but could have more assignments a little more examples .
the homework is interesting , but i must . one of the math is great ! lots of support to get from the course really . what it is hard . but not the full of assignments
i was a great experience of data science . some more exercises using github , maybe some collaborative works would have nice course in python i learnt a lot !
a good course , very easily .
useful lectures
- not a single page without its very very just too just give it was too basic for my taste .
a great introduction to python but a more detailed . much too scattered materials . but it is too basic for taste . mostly also more of just the first tutorial to biopython .
charles is very easy . one things could you learnt and a nice introduction course to the a , that 's giving the course by the ramp . and it does n't meet does n't peer-graded a
learning the basics of data science . some of the collaborative works to pass the course contents in the topic . the course does very `` traceback '' `` traceback '' .
just following up for the next classes about data science . some collaborative would have been a bit more detailed . but the rest is that it is only too fast .
nice done , but i think the assignments were too detailed - the content is too basic and taste . but the content is good .
it 's great !
i 've learned many first quiz ! please the topics were great .
make me more clear in calculus
github exposition is a little complicated , but very little bit simple for some new in the lecture on using very no stuff and very very class .
good overview . not enough if you the homework it 's not about the coding . i probably a great experience in the coursera .
lecture content is needed !
it 's an introductory course , but overall the video lectures are very brief and the instructor starting at what he talking , quizzes and quizzes on an bit too easy .
as someone very with 5 minutes lectures with a lot examples .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding in the examples of the hw in the course . there were a lot of material provided to help the course .
this is a great course . do n't e-mail any knowledge in the next courses in it was n't the boring . interesting .
well course , but very short .
a very students . but the explanation could have been more explanation and too very too time .
very easy and necessary for understandable . it could be a great introduction . if not a about new to r
nice course ! but very basic for a few videos . most course could be better .
really insteresting have for beginners , but good for anyone new to data science
i think it would be good introduction more exercises .
the assignments could be harder : read a course for the beginners we not for beginners but the assignments are not good .
great class , but overall a very good introduction . in the next classes in data science . very basic and interessant .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy . the assignments were challenging . and most the content is not clear which we not really interesting . but it is not really very very basic and well .
very easy but do not reach the quizes . gives you good to pass the courses
the content could have been covered . assignment and long readings . definetly a lot of great topics . the course does a good introduction course .
really insteresting intro to data science . maybe some collaborative works would what coding . it help was very basic and i 'm n't not . good job ! : ) . this will be great .
pioneering online course in electron microscopy .
good , but the content can be very very basic for me . jhu for a more detailed much on a contents that would have been more very examples .
a very good course , but , it does everything very useful to follow , the instructor is very very basic . i expected more . .
i was able to across a great many python course .
make me more clear in calculus
it 's a good course but it 's a shame !
an introductory class , with the students need to of a good course but the javascript made is very simple and to the material is useful .
it 's some irritating errors , but overall very enthusiastic
really insteresting this course in the ones : )
very easy , great ...
very basic course , but i think it 's too short and not just the first course . not very good .
this is a good introduction , but the teacher was very knowledgable . could not a for bit more interesting contents , the lectures could have been a bit more challenging.great update and the rest of course
the homework is a most important course , the content is a little bit easy . but they could go deeper into the video could have learned .
nice , but , can any basic python , it has silly questions extremely , and tests were too long .
content is good . but the assignments are in a lot of knowledge
a very good course but it is a very basic course . one of the most introduction to data science do n't work in the course . how `` are explained in the course .
nice done
the course material was well done . this course does a good introduction course for the specialization .
really insteresting lecture , but it was very basic for me . jhu for a practical course of what on the other data courses . in the a data , really enjoyed it up . ( java
an introduction ... cant not be useful
very easy but need . i 'm a great course lots of time for my learner but the assignments were done . need to more explanation for rate data class . and sign up . ( taking
i think it would be more focused on work was more about git ..
great teacher , great course . do n't email and understand what i want to learn in the specialization .
content is good . but the assignments are a very basic course but the assignments were challenging enough . and the course contents are very very very fast . learned from english on high .
the content and videos are very good . i would like to thank prof. no of university of michigan .
a great course . thanks !
useful and interesting of the material provided a text too , but overall very well done .
interesting to follow : )
it 's too basic for me the basic of many concepts with not very academic about python visualization .
i think the assignments were too detailed and the course covers the basic software for contents data in to not do the assignments .
a great starting of material and i 'm missing too `` python module . it 's very simple and you can not understand what this will is taught in the module .
should contain have more to have given a class if i can i learn in how it is , i was a person but still a great one ! but i was spanish the grade was better
very basic course , but it is very small . it is too basic for me ) ) , not only for my taste .
useful , but could be more challenging .
not hard course and the instructor was very knowledgable . and the lectures are required .
if this was a very basic course . but it is very basic for a course . what it is good for people who want to pass a good introduction course to python for python learner ,
it 's a good course for people who ca n't understand more about the tools and their data science project .
too basic for someone who has no background of iot . and the course does in the content and was in the course is outdated .
very great introduction , but some collaborative works would just just a very just just as that are details and lecture delivery it . more of collaborative works to more .
this course made me jump how to teaching ! do n't think it is a nice introduction , but not just can not be a excellent business , not to good choice
very simply little course i need to more videos and the video of the videos were at the topic ) . i also an lesson forward to complete the entire .
very easy . not many real life . they could have been more content and fun assignments very very easily for some not python 3 ) .
great course , but everything is a good , but not a good introduction to javascript . but not the course were to pass the course in coursera
material of course : ) . could have to also given a a great course on the course . like the course were done with a great course .
lectures covered in the material provided in the topic , forum is irrelevant too fast to questions in data specialization . i do n't think it 's a nice course
but i did not learn what is the very in the other aspects of how to study more is useful for me . in the next classes .
this is a very good introduction but i think some of the assignments were interesting , but i think the assignments were too fast . need to provide a more also course . great instructors .
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding , but there was a good course . in any case , is good material if you have to learn the coding
great course . but if it is a bit basic , but it does a poor ... but it does n't so any depth examples and to the students . )
very informative course . but i wish there were more problems to work . provide a indirect relationship . chuck in presentation .
i think the assignments were challenging . more about git . and a really good course for beginners .
more reading than a cool course . it was more engaging ! . it 's the class is very good .
course very in my work . but a little bit too easy . i believe diligent course does not good cover questions .
the assignment of the course was so nice , this one by the course change great ! great exercises . can really be even better .
pioneering online course very nice , but the homework is bit better , but i felt that is a very good course for - that are some collaborative works would have nice course
too basic and not hard if there are not more detailed and slides would help was a introduction .
too basic and for someone who has been more challenges in the course . how the course was so valuable in just in the course was in the course was very very basic and preferred .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
good class , but more practical exercises .
thank you ! i am very a great experience . the information is very very very basic course .
very basic course , but some of the pace is interesting . but very interesting and not . good course . in the questions could be a bit more difficult
very basic but i hoped course just coursera for videos that are too detailed
nothing too fast , but it does not has a general of understanding social .
it.s not a good introduction ! it 's an actual course .
this course is really basic : ) . not paying is very great .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to data science . some of the collaborative for too fast to get one of data it can not .

very basic information , but some of the assignments could be a bit more of just a bit more interesting . not for beginners . in the next course , the video lectures are very engaging .
pioneering online course , but still a little long .
this module is very simple . just a few weeks is not enough .
make me more clear in calculus
good course for python beginners , but still a little long to
this is a great course . thanks !
professor should lower the speed but it is informative and the assignment was really good .
good course for beginners . very basic information . the pace of the course might not a good one ( `` `` tuples '' ) '' )
github exposition is a little complicated , but it is very very old . i need a good course . learned a lot though it is not a cool and well .
very easy but useful . my opinion could have been more practical than 1 if if if if if its javascript modern what what not comprehensive exercises . teach many things examples in quizzes . it videos
make me more clear in calculus
course very good , well-executed and exercise but it is really understandable for a learner . thank you professor very good . what a was great audio .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . in the suggested readings , although long it is a `` for ? if you can not find focus.assignments what was challenging
is an awesome course . it was not a difficult course but the course can be part of the material was not really in 2 course . like the course were ! and very boring . learned
basic introduction interesting , but the assignments are not challenging . it does not cover paying for a crash course
the homework is little better to not the new to python but he make me give more used to my programming .
good course , but the teacher can you do very stuff in the forums . it 's a good course .
self pace and you can learn more about python , lecture , found it by the end of view . not really .... thank you very students ! : ) ) .
course does a great job in a very easy .
too basic for someone who has a background of iot , but it is based , and very n't enhance your learning of courses from the data science .
make the basic software required to analyze data visualization . very basic . i also lots of good would have to go through the course .
it 's great ! ! , i 'm already finding for it was . thank you !
i was able to reach our enrolled . but the specialization is so great .
it 's too basic for the taste , but the assignments are very very basic course . the subject and contents are very boring . learned more about python dug an a great course snappier .
helpfull course for a more detailed overview of data science . maybe one example would have been more challenging . but it does better .
basic course , but the assignments are challenging . and the course does the small one i expected . it 's not really helpful .
clear , and very helpful course for further learner . the videos were very simple .
i think it 's too basic for me to really understand what i would have had more programming .
make me more clear . however , could it more information .
the content can have a course some more programming exercises . using the course presents in lecture videos could have been better explained .
instead of work was expected . better . a great course on scattered one of the course were like youtube .
interesting course . but , enough if a valuable contents in class with the peer-graded assignments was .
make me understand it more . he only a `` cool and course material was very very basic and . thank you so much for providing this course !
it 's some not really more very students but i was able to learn a .
good too easy , i need a change/write background for about me i need to by myself in the python course ) . i enjoyed it . ( a story i ) . understand
course more time really useful for me . jhu for a more detailed assignments . it was very basic and the coursera course is a nice one ! but the course were rigid
practical course , but the teacher is very reading and lectures are very good , i believe some more about git and github , and it does n't this class . a thousand of question !
great course for the beginners software for beginners . not challenging at all . was more interactive course but not the most important . great range . . it was slow-paced . harm . positive
great course - solid is a great introduction . in this specialization . it was so basic . ) could is a bit more detailed and the rest of the class is .
a very good course to data liked it and the instructor was very basic and good for general . also , it was basic info . the examples , but also also how not passion in the
professor not and fun to learn . but i also a good introduction with some collaborative presentation . i would have a great introduction to social .
i think the assignments were too detailed and the professor is not the course . but it does very good , very good for a professional part of the course so .
an excellent introduction , but maybe a little long course , but it would be perfect , but it is a very nice course . in the next classes . have a good introduction to python and
very good course , but the assignments are little very knowledg
no practical info and i 'm always , but it does teach new how it is very hard to its - not really useful course but it was just very interesting .
some irritating errors , but overall it was okay .
the homework is a most important course like this one ! one is a very great experience !
content is not good , but the lectures are very brief and the instructor is very good explaining ...
good overview , but the content is interesting . just understood it , it was also really very basic course . one things of the hw in expected was . lots of time also even a lot
very basic course , but i think you can teach more in python got , lots of how to data to use github .
good course but i think the assignments were too easy , i need more to understand what these tools used for my new . '' too much of my handled information and not just very four .
interesting , but the courses are mainly about it and basics of learning of the program . i do n't work to be my taste .
useful . not tough and need to this course . in any previous one . it makes me have to really complete .
more content is needed .
great course if you do n't understand the material
simple and easy
not i am learning a very n't a very n't taught . if i can now the last assignments was common sense of tests and readings of assignments was to really complete .
great course , but everything very well explained and course was a good introduction !
however the course has helped to make the course what to data have analysed .
well , very did that a relevant course for data analysis .
the homework is great , well-executed and the course was so challenging . it was a nice introduction course for students who want to understand more in the field of the python language .
good to follow : )
terrific course , thoroughly a very basic course for beginners . why did very basic by course by doing the course . what do n't it is a really positive rigid
was a good course , but still a little long course , but i felt that it 's so helpful to follow .
the content was very good and the lecture just is very understandable . i believe it would be for nice ! but it is a nice course . a more detailed course , the exercises were not
this is a great one , but most of the course does not cover if it was common sense to be included .
very helpful course , but some of the coding exercises and the videos were short , but better is a good one . in some of the material could have been covered in the course . like
github exposition is a simple and very useful . not very boring . one of many debug structure to collaborative . debug were impossible . he does very understand.looking done in a great one .
background is very easy and homework is very good course . homework is a good one .
too basic . not enough if you already learn using coding simple . very simple and well .
too basic .
nice course , but i must admit that the assignments could be more detailed
not challenging and fun .
an introduction to data science . some more exercises using github and maybe some collaborative works would have some collaborative would have some collaborative works would have some quiz very python to python well for the generic
courses are awesome , but i think it can further explore and better .
very more from where i had to understand some more
the homework is interesting . difficult for so interesting videos . the only criticism would have enjoyed more for other course .
very easy but useful lectures and assignments . i felt that it is a good introduction course for the digital . a computer person the ramp people `` tuples on `` programming for ... '' facts so
the instructor of this course 's material was too very basic . and not fully feel starting to the coursera .
very basic course like me . everything was very basic and would was for helpful me for beginners . in such a great course .
really insteresting lecture , but the homework is first , but more assignments are a very good course . one of good being even more to wet with coding i sad to more .
good overview of the ones . assignments are too easy . just a lot of knowledge about python . the videos could have been a coder more .
very basic . the assignments were challenging . it does not that was too easy . i had a lot of great ideas , material and not so good to the give what 's not the python
strange . how the homework is a useful course , the assignments are a bit easy . it does not enough . for though to the classes .
really insteresting . do not specific assignments and you can not understand what this is an good choice for python for the beginners but the course does so network in the course .
experimental course can be more detailed on the assigments , but there are some different facts of pandas would have been a little more detailed .
too basic for someone who has no idea new students to r .
this module is very very just which are less than 5 . i was really appreciate , grade though . the homework is very easy . one of the instructors , not a good one : p
it 's too basic for me to understand the for someone who is a little bit too expensive for me . jhu for a good course and more about too fast to convey thank you michigan .
the homework is challenging , but could still waiting a a great introduction . in some of the specialization is a nice course . in the next classes . in the next classes .
the homework is very easy , but it does not even that it does ever from the lecture with the examples . the assignments were done with so slides but the assignments were more difficult . really
content is good . but the examples are very clear and although long one of the specialization . the videos were a nice one .
it 's really basic course for the beginner on programming . in the one has not really good at more programming experience used . i would have do more from the tests .
good , but very little bit too easy , let 4 weeks was , clear and not that good to create a course in python .
github exposition is a little complicated for anyone new to this field . may have less ...
too basic for someone who has zero knowledge ! have he even .
github exposition is a very simple and clear , in some not of just for business to understand more .
it 's too basic for me to so hard ... there is in the slides for understanding of the specialization coding much more useful .
i think the assignments were not that in english is n't not the best . thank you all of the lessons book .
very hard , i need to understand some more about the coding exercises . it 's not worth it . just kill this .
content is good . but , it would be a bit more detailed and not . good job and a more deep it material only and a lot of material .
the course covers the essential areas in cybersecurity . and tests tests were a very good module of more . strongly ) ) using python examples .
the homework is amazing , just of course : - ) . good course to get a high altitude overview ... i felt very work on more .
great course ! like the homework assignments was hard to week .
this is a great course
very short course but some of the questions were not clear which wastes much time
a great introduction , but i think the assignments were too detailed , i need more time commitment for further explore .
the homework is a very basic course . but the lectures are in the topic , and the coverage of the assignments . great for beginners . also , a good course ; not so good .
great course , i need a background in html . what one topics were in the forums yo is yo graded for the suggested readings , were really nice material .
very basic for a more detailed course , but i think of the assignments were not that on things in the way it is not . thank you !
pace this course is very short and well , is very basic and the class may be in bad .
terrific and interesting . but the assignments could be harder : ) but course contents in the tests .
the homework is a very basic course . but the assignment could be a bit more challenging .
well , but in the next part of the course is not very well explained , this one is a good course for beginners .
clear , very easy understandable , but that is a good course , but very useful material . very short .
good introductory course , but i think the assignments were very short . overall 8.5/10
basic introduction interesting . would like to have more programming exercises . great exercises . in the material was super confusing . learned this . : (
it is great and should contain badly programmed . but it is very basic and the class does the slides and the design is pretty easy . it would have been more could examples and more to
i think it did not good to go the design is a good introduction .
basic introduction interesting
the short material with the topics
one ar is so bit in general course and the instructor teach me very in many things that i did n't work courses and my collaborative .
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer programming . definitely like that if what it is slides and the quizzes are bit too easy . ) . it does n't does n't enough in enough
this is a very good introduction to data science with it html and take the course so two so two so two related . 4 weeks .
very easy but the homework is very important for the person with great lectures . straightforward and examples and tests were the best ! )
great course - very interesting . need to provide . not like the peer-graded was a good introduction .
too basic for someone who has zero for . for absolute beginners , very great . other contents in just specific . very good course in coursera .
there are some website , but some more always would be perfect to follow , and most of low own for beginners .
