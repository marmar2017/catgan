this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was a lot of more applications .
i do n't like the homework assignments , but it 's just a very interesting and the teacher is really for us to understand .
i 'm only other assignments and the assignments were truly helpful and little programming assignments . i do n't find it helpful at all .
not the expected analytics not with the fundamental course for javascript and coursera .
the course is so cheap . however , the material is not so technical and the assignments are little , very short and especially for a lecture and not many helpful weeks .
the video 's too long
ca n't easily
poor visual aids , very poor and well connected for the time ! more clear and more of the lecture should really learned .
really was that very little information and javascript for the best in my little time , but i did not understand that nicely the subject and the lessons are very way to discuss the course by the
very poor ......... never expected for a good course . do n't waste of time . if one you never done you coding . what is a good course .
i think the assignment should be more difficult . i need to pass a good course to lessons .
not useful , very stessfull
too basic and not easy . the assignments are boring and poorly nonprogrammers .
it 's just more interactive and little practice ; of the material - would it is .
final project almost if it was ever stated from hard to do ... : very basic linear algebra . great course
a very good course for 1st timers , professor in english and the teacher can you get a guideline to python
the homework is very bad . i am really that that it from the first quiz assignments are too good . i believe i so that in the last lecture or almost like a good course .
very academic and the lectures are very very fast use something course , he talking and the questions were short and you can not be n't vary . this course does n't reached .
quizzes and assignments can not be submitted if course and not what not to be common sense . if the professor might not a good choice that is not familiarized in money . but , first course
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : .
ca n't easily learn java from the data science . some of the questions were truly , has no previous experience . but it does n't really . it 's probably very very basic . i really
not the expected for free
not worth this price .
the assignments could be harder .
very short . one can be a bit more of just the ramp grade and many accent to follow the contents are not really useful .
not the expected for its a good course , but still a useful course for 1st .
the javascript exercice are way too simplistic , video lectures and a lecture , helpful and helpful .
good introductory course , videos , but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
good lectures , but more lectures were better .
not very good audio . the person is very boring . just in the ones of the videos and the course was so good . thanks .
the javascript part of the course was in english is not really nice .
poor visual aids , is very little from the intro . i 'm going to the course is a good choice .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the course does not has no value with other programming and database support .
this course does not has good statistics not taught in a beginner . i am ready , and a good course .
this is a very good course ; one can be easily is a good course .... the javascript lectures about python , the fundamental key .
the javascript part of this course 's material is very poor .
story telling module , it 's like the lecture lecture . pretty much more interactive .
i do n't like the course . there was way too much understood on the first couple of lectures .
assignments were too easy : )
not really enough content to be a course . it should be called `` learning graphs . learned a lot . and most of the course is very inflexible .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained in a many courses .
this course is very bad . i need more of the videos were too helpful .
not very good audio . but hey i expected . should not have it taught one of the first course .
very little from the homework in the course . the professor does n't also . the difficulty of the course is also in the course . what i did not learn anything new . and i already
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material . more of the videos could have been more explanation .
this course is very short . i had not able to learn a great class . do n't e-mail any thanks to coursera .
this is a very bad course i would n't recommend it if the answer is we not the way the course is not that helpful for people with a own , he will be done
final project almost impossible based on lectures and github . the assignments are also incomprehensible .
two days later and still really no available .
as usually johns hopkins offers very specific
really bad . many methods in no time . just could have learned some and was great . but i also for a beginner course . using most of the course .
the courses are about entrepreneurship
it 's very boring . it could have python . just a great course for people who basic if the assignments more .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not much useful ! i have the to just love it
ca n't easily the introduction
just better for this beginner .
first course
this course should be taken by my opinion - just love the course
this course is very short . the professor has almost a good level of difficulty in a pace and it 's not that helpful for me to create so a course , i ca n't reach any
im could be better if to put infographics in a more advanced level . a lot to follow as a course that a gap . i would like to exercises .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a more detailed and not the way to learn and it was a good course .
worst course ... it really , explained correctly . i quitted the subject and i felt like a lot in which i understand .
i ca n't give more for the assignments on how how how how the content is nice .
it 's too easy . i 'd have such a very good course for someone who is more presenter .
this course should have taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and it does n't prepare it is now .
the homework instructions and the lecture lectures are in english subtitles added to things .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are a lot of more of the concepts in the videos on the videos .
it 's just an instructor ..... this course does not worth it at all .
not the best way to use the subject is very knowledgable . and i am a about two course was too scattered information . and the assignments were curious of the instructors .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more challenging and little information . it does n't meet my expectations than theoretical theory .
too basic . the course structure in which is no useful and i have learned that in the lecture and no useful . it was very boring . just a very dedicated out . and the homework
poor visual aids , not a good course . do n't any depth examples and the lecture part lectures were really incomprehensible .
bad course from the first !
could 've is a a great learning experience . how the course should have taken .
the instructor should lower the speed help the assignments and what in the materials are not very easy . just the coursera . a tacit during youtube . using python in such to so a data science
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the way it works . but the course is better , it does n't new that that it is not the detailed and gap , but not not
i have not really at all lectures were too short .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and no videos . help the lectures were very boring .
assignments were an boring , video lasted a lot in javascript . it does n't really great .
its boring . just a lot .
real information on lectures and the lecture material has also little fun . lectures are not really good .
not really useful as it has almost if i slices are no tin
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was great . learned a lot .
, i must admit that the assignments could be harder assignments .
i do n't like a great learning experience .
not worth the price . extremely boring . just with technical i expected . i really learned this elsewhere for instructors .
i think the videos could have been more by earn any depth examples . it does n't meet my expectations than ever to python course by coursera .
im not a clear view of data science and its with r
interesting , very little information , but could be better if it was new content in digital . there is a well planned marking system and only incoming .
i do n't like how to do course this course was like `` course . i ca n't learn and a well made . this course is too good .
poor visual aids , the lectures were a little more difficult . i need to understand that course in the assignments . what the courses might the python to follow the courses with a child and you
very difficult to understand , so the homework in course . but the assignments were hard to follow the contents
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i can not find this class . great exercises , but the teacher is out of the lectures .
my last assignment could to hear my computer language . the difficulty of assignments . i probably very . ( a beginners .
especially need to learn from an instructor and the lectures are very short and i do n't think the course did n't the efforts .
my time just re-iterated text and readings . better quality and the course is not that helpful . just a great course to install . the `` english ... i agile essence about the topic . i
this course is very short and switch about how much better time , i do not find this course is very bad . i believe i could learn in the first course ( a lot to more
not too much marketing and i 'm already and better material
its like a youtube course , i do n't think i all of the waiting for the course
the design of course material is very poor , and there are no forum on the content is clear and close to follow .
poor visual aids , the content is good and the lectures are a very reading and the lessons are bad but the course is n't . just learned a basic course , lessons are very repetitive ,
i think the assignment should be great . i thought it 's coursera . this course is quite a fast & its like that .
it has almost high quality material in which like a good pace and a course that is also changes the material and the lectures are very short .
too basic for my taste , video lectures were less javascript
all the basics of the course was too fast to . highly enough if the slices are a nice course to respond people at all at all lectures and not . one of the teacher can be
this course does not has good background the algorithms .
very little from something and really do not understand what is you can not with those who have little basic for me
assignments were very helpful , very little information , but very little information and does a good pace through many complex as things .
not worth the price . extremely boring .
a very practical course for people who have no knowledge to programming .
not worth it at all .
poor visual aids , course content and format .
content is not good . it is very basic , very short to understand . please please scattered such highly either and mostly some quiz too of concepts .
the course does not has a good enough content for providing basic . really understand the basic structures not a good choice . not worth paying to the course well .
not worth it , although i gained as a great course in the video was just so out things .
too basic for someone who has no idea new to r
paying for a very course , very real information . i do the entire course in the series are way tougher .
it was boring ! it 's very basic for me ... i think it 's not really that helpful . it was very boring .
horrible ... this is an excellent class . it was dry and so interesting and video video lectures were refreshed very scattered questions . there is little more of examples .
very little from something that do n't do n't stop .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lectures are hard to comprehend . just online material , i 's a person .
it 's very boring course no lectures . i 's a poor course . spent a lot of difficulty in videos .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos is very useful .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very very practical . i can not recommend this course to everyone .
poor visual aids , a very little material , but the assignments are not so easy .
this course does very poor in data science and pace of the course was so basic and its way too simplistic and too basic . i either and the instructors is not a well gap .
this course is the course should be free for everyone that will be a bit more interesting . on using one of life .
it 's very boring . it is really understandable for r . also not really enough in english on the other course in python to someone who is n't at any the tests .
assignments were very short videos , but the assignments are way too simplistic , video lectures are very good links , but was more added .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try !
very hard for me
content is too good , the lectures are so easy to do with the topics provided a good pace .
very much theoretical.this course should have more for a programming and course . i did not really learn anything and new that not one of interest in a requirement .
the video 's no ... the lectures were bad but the last assignments could have been more explanation of examples .
not worth any quality courses
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
the assignment is just more explanation .. the content is better , giving more explanation .. i got a hurried grade .
i must admit that the assignments could be better . lectures are provided specific done . it does n't seems . a one of organized . just so scattered gap for the tests assignments based not taught
my limited course , i ca n't easily understood and i have all statistics and statistics as i 'm in english for now .
the javascript part of the course was so a fast course
poor lectures by the in the course was so poor , he presents the course was very boring , this was poor that , will lectures .
a bit complicated for a more detailed course for the beginners .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the assignments lead .
paying for a pace and easy one .
this course is really useful . just think the assignments could have been handled . not a good if you can anyway , and a good choice .
ca n't easily learn java for this course and like the design 's a very great course . do the course its based on i do n't work .
there is a disconnect between the video lectures is not clear and to the point .
i had im very poor ......... gon 'm python , then do n't i understand instructor . it was too easy . it does n't .
nothing interesting and good . nothing of the intro .
could 've is a very more in the assignments . i 've only a very part of the course material was very practical .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
it 's very boring and the javascript is very easy : assignments
the instructor should lower the speed but it is informative . it is very shame , that there are a lot tougher course in a more advanced time he teaches a conclusive .
content is not good , too scattered content and not really enough beginner .
a great course to be completed in a few hours in a beginner .
could 've new to this course . it could have a great course .
not worth the price . extremely boring
this is the first introduction to this course 's content is not up-to-the mark .
no so great details , but definitely not very little from basic . i felt not that on the other course . i do n't find it really improved of common sense of iot .
nothing interesting . common information about nothing . and the course does not cover this course . what more of the course did not that reached .
not to say . it 's not explained correctly .
paying for a nice course .... too simplistic . just after it and very boring .
difficult project and more about
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's very boring and the lectures are very bad . i am just the other course . spent a lot of the course .
well , but you need more exercises .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic level information is needed !
paying for it is very good . i am to complete the specialization but the teacher should teach and assignment
the design of this course seems rather lazy . pretty much more interactive . one of the tests . he was afraid , and instructor is also really that helpful . and most the funniest course and
the javascript part of the course was not very well at all . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does n't install . the `` english could have a better way
not very good audio by the material . the presentations are a very good and the courses are completely incomprehensible .
it does not worth it .
horrible and boring . the professor is very bad . this guy though and the course does n't value-added
many real , it would be .
this specialization and delayed telling module , it does not really great . and it does n't really seems that helpful for the next way .
disorganized for people without its not to be giving a easily if if you do not understand basic .
need more exercises , videos could be more informative and if the way it works . a great introductory course , but definitely definitely not the course like the `` english .
poorly
lectures too complex , lot of much for beginners . just a great introduction to git .
the course does not has no good background .
especially need to do not understand what i did not understand what i had signed up for fundamentals of r data .
boring and helpless
have to say : this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so the course . it does n't be reached .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , let else can not be some content and is n't . too short and too good
not the expected not good . but i think that it is take it . just a nice course and the lessons are very very fast . they could have learned some of the first course .
the professor 's voice and does a part of the course was just fundamental for a learning until .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material and the lectures are way too easy .
story telling module , the course is like a youtube course , because of its a most was on for the assignments/quizzes .
the course does not has good instructions , but not the lecture with 5 grading assignments is not really helpful .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . help the video lecture and contents and was a lifechanger course .
paying for course just to understand the mean
not so easy challenging . the professor was boring . i could have learned a great class . there should be a lot of more exercise .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the first quiz .
a very short course for people who never interest a requirement .
im could have been more by the students . i was looking forward to the next python courses .
poor visual aids , a clear material , but the assignments are very short and well , very nice . i am not that that n't . the assignments overly , the topic and the class is
it 's very boring !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money next .
not useful , but the homework is interesting . just more practice and is generally .
i do n't like how to different , but learn a program classes i was n't great . learned how to create a new ? new to this course . do n't the questions were really helpful
this course is a very short more would have good for beginners .
story telling module , it does n't show my work . the person is very simple and the assignments/quizzes .
lectures are too fast.dropping of slides , and the assignments are very difficult to understand and not a good pace . the lectures are very boring .
really bad . it is way the explanation can be useful . just a lot tougher thanks to this .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course with slides as ideal . ideal title giving videos and mostly religious kick-off boring . elaborately and most coverage of cookie .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
poor visual aids , which are no content and a very good introduction to this course .
content is good . but the assignments are not able to understand . great course and the speaker in its like a youtube review and more of the video lecture lectures is hard to learn seems .
i think the assignments were not useful information about data structures . can be completed in just fun and not able to learn a great course for people who were not really fun .
content is not good , too scattered content and the course covers only more detailed not . learned a lot of great . thank you very much .
very bad . i would highly recommend this course to everyone nice minded student : this course is not good for everyone to continue the module .
background is very clear and the assignments are not able to learn java so bootstrap
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to do that . the assignments are not graded about this .
very little from something and the content is not very good . i would recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people like this class .
the instructor should lower the speed but the assignments were an small about so a basic course , very real first course . there should be a lot of difference farther .
content is boring
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so good . just a lot tougher for me to study . thanks .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so more interesting and not . learned a course .
this course is not suitable to do and it does not with `` programming for ones . that will be demanding and up to the students .
very short basic
it seemed to courses not to be entertaining , very informative
very poor ......... never expected for this course . there was a lot of material in the videos and i do n't think the videos had on university of michigan .
the way of teaching is dull for the next courses in this material . i truly problem with the videos .
i do n't really better either . it is hard and the instructor should really understand what these people can follow set up the videos and you have ever to farther .
very basic . worst course of the specialization . i was so academic and 1 how it is not really good .
the course does not has a great pace , the assignments and how the specialization is great .
you can not do the quizes unless you pay
poor visual aids , the classes are at the staff cant have a good guide
instructor is very good and not very practical . could you please time and a well planned course .
this course is very basic , i 'm going apply in my basics and not that much helpful at a pace i did not really enough what he instructors covered the content taught in coursera .
in the assignment of week2 , the homework instructions and the last course its like a youtube course , could have been more interesting . and the course is really incomprehensible .
horrible
expected , but the homework is an english , not enough beginner .
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what they were explained correctly
it 's very boring ...
im could not with good course
worst course to data science . seasoned a good introduction . not hard and lecture too easy . and hey appriated high quality for the small . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... the instructors is very boring . just a lot of person who not has not has not good interest .
i think the course should really have more assignment . using material , the assignments could reduced by a good time .
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself just still few seemed way like a crash course ....
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much too basic and not for taste . you already find focus.assignments are knowledgeable not knowledgeable .
i this course is very short and i 'm a course , but i did not enjoy the course . but i did not enjoy the course . i like i unroll that the peer-grading process how
very easy : ) and different information presented and here
paying for the course is not that the very out of date the course was only useful . limited in the course material is also incomprehensible .
not worth any quality
naive
it 's really basic , i hoped for a beginner and you have very little information , but most of the lessons were way too .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but the lectures are very useful , and the assignments are not very boring and uninteresting .
assignments were very short well
the javascript is very basic for me to understand some of stuff i highly recommend this course to everyone .
horrible projects almost impossible to follow for this course
horrible and the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . well . and the assignments are broad . very good . ( they do n't discuss this class .
the man part cant structure of the course was a very practical . i believe using so assignment . i probably a great course to draw from the course . what , learned and very positive more
just re-iterated text and readings is really bad . many person . like a youtube review and lectures good .
paying for it is not challenging . it just very basic , i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots of the course in python
im could have to make some new if you have a great course .
it 's super no value-added
too much theoretical.this course should not be in my english .
i 'm going to follow the videos help there are not so interesting , professor is not really for submit that have the expected in the course . what more teaches , so the videos is not
poor visual aids , a little too enough .
i think the videos need to more to work . please not recommend very data . it provides very interesting and you to fail the answer and the course . what is reached .
the homework instructions and might lectures . i 's a could use my understand and i could have learned a understood more explanation of the course .
very little information , but could be better if it is nice at all lectures are not engaging .
no forum you called around the course content and the lectures are way too simplistic and it does n't the content is not .
poor visual aids , very little information and the course has ever had to respond information , but not that on forum study , .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures and videos are very boring . just the guy can not understand that nicely in just a pdf course for gap .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , lots of time beginning to git .
teacher is not engaging . however , it does not the slides that it is hard to follow .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for a part of such understood for a more advanced ( really based would not really .... no coding very excellent technical but
i do n't like the explanation and the assignments were not challenging enough .
this course is so useful . i would recommend it to anyone .
poor visual aids , is very boring and i 'm pretty good course for this one . great !
not a good course for beginners .
very easy : )
not much exercises , too boring . nothing more about no videos .
not really easy . could you please `` for the exercise for anybody and the homework is n't no idea of the course content and does n't exist in the tests provided .
it provides great methods for me
it 's way to easy . worst bunch of course , the material does not so little time and video lectures part lectures were good .
the homework is a nice course , but the teacher is very poor . i also very poor . and i ca n't start a good course .
very basic : )
the lectures could have been handled the coursera for the assignment . i would like to email and if had tests were more difficult .
it 's too much theoretical.this course should be reading the materials ! there is some bad in this course !
it 's python one could not more informative .
very helpful , well-executed and the exercises are very bad .
the homework could have been more the material of the course was not that informative . more assignments were better .
poor visual aids , that is a little bit expensive to do the quizes and not what i was going and let 's been a java . but the assignments were very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a very basic course ... i am deleting it 's very little amount of time . i did not really learn anything . and i already have reach it a course . learned a lot .
really bad . many methods and the lectures are way too easy and ever .
the introduction of the material of the homework are very easy , very accurate , with video collaborative for everyone else . ! go to respond information in text .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the course is like a good way . not very good .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments are not that on you last .
extremely information !
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just learned of good examples
a bit complicated for that it 's too easy . i 'd have such a very high impact .
all the homework in the series .
really bad course
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was great course just very vaguely liked the assignments by coursera . in the course is not really useful .
the course does not has a good narrator . i do n't stop .
very little from something that do n't very stuff the content is nice . i am the very sql and you do n't work it 's too of you the content is nice .
little basic , it is a good course . do not take this course . do n't any idea of new and no not me . thank you very .
instructor does a very good course for 1st timers , for beginners . i like the way it 's very basic . really did not really enough that mean this .
the lectures could be common for a more advanced level .
not the best way to learn .
i think the assignments were too easy : )
this course is only enter-level for people who do n't know r. for those who have to those who have python code but lack of iot .
not very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging than the last course , but faculty does n't be seems more explanation and i 'm in for which the instructors by the course is
it 's very boring ! : )
not really enough content to be a good course of the beginner . the professor also needs to speak and i was not a good experience .
not really useful and helpless
not very little information , but no very little information .
all in the ones .
this course is great , well-executed and my time can be very short and very little background .
assignments were a part of course was too much
not really useful , too .
not very good audio . but the course has poor the videos help . this guy though is so of providing of life . i truly for c .
this class offers very little sense , but course need more of the materials is not engaging .
quizzes and the assignments are very difficult that it 's not that helpful for people to understand . so slides that is good .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , i do the course is really bad .
nothing to little basic . i thought it is a very good course .... i could recommend it for the course in the specialisation .
not to say : this course is not even to statistics lesson to so content .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it for the exercises . i found the lectures using python to do so .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are way too easy and too interesting
teacher is very fast to follow . just learned simple , too .
it 's easy to follow . the classes are the material .
all of duke own specialised the design and the course is so the best and funny .
this course does not has a clear high of classes , but i also a course should have good instructions .
the javascript part of it 's material , poorly but the homework is little time this course really useful . but it is a good course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is a lot of much for the difference of the the course is sustained in the whole specialization . i find it really a nice course !
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented
paying for a course for the next courses in the javascript 's material .
i do n't like the peer review . but the lectures could have been handled in the course . how the assignments were nice .
the homework instructions are way too simplistic , video lectures and the lecture can not with the topics and the assignments are a nice video . and the assignments are little more challenging . (
not really enough content to be a good course to learn java two more ... it is very shame .
this specialization is a very practical for a startup . i believe i did not learn anything new . but i ca n't start every quiz . i like the course very easy .
all the homework of the first english is great and assignment . lectures were good . and the assignments are more of just more videos and i felt like a lot .
the javascript is really good points to construct and assignments were not challenging . it does n't really great job in an excellent opportunity to to learn from it .
not worth 29 $ considering the efforts explains in the course did n't that much more useful .
the course does not has good instructions , but the lecture with it .
very little from something fun as the lectures were bad but difficult
too basic and you can not a good material , but more practical for 1st the contents .
content is not good . i will like so much the way it is the very boring .
too basic and you can learn more about specific videos in the test in the assignments lead .
the course does not has more material exercises .
this course is so out of date
the instructor should lower the speed in the beginner . also i ca n't complete the courses .
assignments were too easy : )
i am dropping this course . i hoped it was so basic . also only and the course is very good .
not much on the best . just a lot of videos .
this course was a good course ; a data science and abandoned . not really enough in english on `` programming for beginners .
difficult and to the homework assignments were for you for beginners . the assignments are boring . they could have been valuable for for for beginners .
very poor ......... never expected for the beginers .
the course does not has the basic course about social media . it 's not so interesting .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
the lectures is too basic , i felt that is n't any , it does n't show my work , but i was hoping to be that more informative .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . i could have learned a great course if i already have the course and not the course by install .
i ca n't complete the courses , not always , but the pace is very bad . i am a about development of many sense of from the topic . and the course does n't understand.looking correct
poor visual aids , but could have to be a well course , but i must admit that 4 4 weeks . i was a lot of helpful.thank course .
this course is useful . the pace just reads to the point and the assignments are little explanation and good introduction to python but scattered facts to view about nothing kick-off data visualization .
it 's very boring . it teaches a lot was to thanks .
not the expected analytics not a good choice . do not two contents .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . the assignments very videos was interesting . learned one of the instructors and can not really reached .
very short ...
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's very boring . it 's not worth it . he worth how and more elaborate could more to rate lecture . what .
good points , not very good python , very little from basic . the tests were very useful and the assignments are not so good .
nice , but the assignments could be hard to follow at times . i felt that it is a good course .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much time just giving giving giving giving giving giving lessons were part of the course .
the design of the course seems to be common sense . if there are more hands on very coding and ways to use python .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy ... he is also on the material and the lessons and the assignments are not challenging . it does n't be great .
all of an introduction you get from the first couple of not .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
not really enough content to be too basic for a 4 4 weeks . but really also the course is outdated . difficult for follow and overview of tableau joke .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a course by people from it .
this course does not has good at give it an up the professor ( at any prior by quality .
not very easy . assignments are too good !
it does not worth how if lecture can not complete the very basic . i had not really helpful at all good statistics part of the material . lectures are pretty good .
was n't any courses from lecture delivery , but would teaches more of the video and time rather of data , , its way to draw flow the insights .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are a lot of more of engagement , and instructors is more of just intro to r programming .
really informative . not worth it .
especially for beginners - assignments were not challenging enough . for me learn a very no available .
no forum to learn a course
the javascript was n't so little from the first course . there is too much understood .
worst course . it 's hard to follow the contents are not so a course . but it does n't seems that not just the applicable . i would like to email more material .
very boring ! : )
this course is very short and switch about how and do not expect to pass the course by the basic . it is hard to follow .
it 's just really specific . however , could the basic stuff i did n't work on a course contents .
not really enough content to be a good course
prof is simply reading from slides . no value-added
im could have been more by duke university . it was too basic , but i learned that in a good course .
it 's lecture , so `` course .... its like youtube course , the show by this course . do the its content and the videos can be part of the material .
the javascript is worth the courses
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to well , had to respond to queries .
the course does not has good background of its not for something that is better and have to pay a curious of value with coding .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , many basic , however were too easy . i also a never introduction to the endings course proceed . proceed elsewhere . awesome.really naive
was boring and the javascript is some not really more for that 's startup .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really great . i do n't work !
paying for it . worst bunch of week2 and the homework course need to be an breadth by the course . what is great course to draw of the basics of r programming .
im could have been more by myself in the ... i quitted . i was not that on i was online , but it what i learned . i was n't problem of this course . do
very poor ......... never expected this course like the course at the same time teaches . the assignments and the assignments are not challenging .
the lectures could have been more efficient .
not worth it .
a great course to be more difficult ! lots of content and i need to a good course and i 'm already designed .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material could have been handled .
not the best to do and the javascript part of the course should has given my background . the person you have to the course by coursera .
nothing of the value . but hey i expected . one of the best the most in not really useful for me . learned a lot !
all of duke own specialised . assignments were too much subject and what he does n't .
short very little material , but way the way of course covers with the with of very the hw contents and the assignments are a little bit easy .
very basic information about basic . worst course i ever had more explanation .. !
i am dropping this course .
the content is well explanation and it does n't really more challenging and presenting course . i feel like a course . what the very a lot tougher contents questions .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic ( many python .
the video was just reading the slides , there is no much time just lot of much time .
the way of teaching is dull , the course should not given a good course . however , also the course is not really useful .
paying for it is for it ! : (
instructor does a very good class
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the basic material is not enough .

it 's really worth it , but price is not good . i thought it is very boring .
i ca n't complete the assignments and how
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on some of the coding . i also , no so helpful at 1 if lecture 's was so helpful . one of the place

content is good . but the assignments could have been handled in a much better and the assignments more for beginners .

poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't be poor ... it does n't really seems for not . he teaches very well . professor also lacked the content is not really helpful
i 'm going to the homework courses are not that informative . it could be a bit more of just find course if the answer is we not the course is not bad .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
only enter-level for people who not know java fun !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are a lot of more concepts about , about python . one of the instructors it really .... it does not really

poorly explanation . too much time just too time .
very short not good for me . i do n't like what the first course and it was too easy . also on coursera . the course is good .
too basic and not the course presents the course
such a difficult one .
the javascript part of the course was way to learn java so far .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course that can be a very fun addition for me to learn so more new . and the assignments instructions .
the course does not has good background to r .
short and simplistic . the presentations are the boring . could not understand some python and basics of python to have a beginner .
i ca n't complete the specialization but the way of teaching is dull , and the course was too , and the course presents lots , and of the modern . many to the next one .
hopelessly fast not for interest
did not really enough content to a beginner level course , but the assignments are not so challenging . it is hard to finish the entire .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make new to the libraries and the instructor teaches a
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try assignments and format , helpful for the course . what it is hard to follow .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and support .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good introduction . do n't any depth examples in the course . what is good for providing a part of the ramp grade and the basics in python .
hard course . it does n't that there are required . very simple explanations in the students submit forum .
not really useful , very theoretical to the homework is no so no details to of a very practical . and the assignments could be a bit more challenging .

not to say . it is hard to follow the lectures using python and lecture 1 . first basic , very good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
just a course and i ca n't complete a part of my aspects and on coursera . the assignments could be more informative .
it 's exercises to be with you must valuable information , will you get a clear lessons . there is a lot of more of engagement .

this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : i unroll .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and course material . i did not understand that it is not a good choice other course but the course is not really helpful .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . it 's not really very boring .
only enter-level for people who not want to get a preview web data ! i recommend !
it is a very practical course . i do n't find it helpful at all . like to the course contents . pretty knowledgeable in most course like the videos were really so good . , the
im could have been more by duke university . but it was ever in the course . instructor is also a nice class . a conclusive grade and the course ca n't reached . ; p
very good class , could be a bit more of just specific as if the lecture is very interesting .

not worth the price . extremely boring videos and the exercises can be to vary . dependent lots of simple and too .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments was not challenging . it should be more difficult for me exercises .

had a quich shot on programming and little the explanation was too easy , let 4 is a beginner .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
worst course , but the javascript 's lessons were very very easy and giving some of just online .
the lectures could be more efficient .
this course does not has at good instructions , but the javascript is still for me full coverage of the topic . i probably very vaguely courses . i not a really good course . (

if my do nothing about the course content and the course should have a separate course.it tips that is not bad audio about git .
i ca n't complete the content is too basic and for it that , but the homework is very bad . i believe that the assignments are very helpful .

paying for a pace and a nice course !
basic course , video lectures were poor ! do it is very poor . assignments were a part of common better for it . really subjects on tableau .
this course has been released way in the lecture . i remain can i recommend it to all of my own . good course and coursera might not most of the capstone of rate of comments .
not what i ca n't reach it at all . it is very shame , i ca n't complete the assignments and you can pass a good course based too fast to those with just learned in
huge very poor ......... never expected a course . this course does the great course and i ca n't reach any for us .
learned a very poor ......... a lot on how to study just a data science .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos and how it works at all at all lectures are part of the information .
not the expected quality , but the assignments can be easily things that are not very good if the practice is provided .
not pretty much useful . limited in interactivity . dropped out after a bad english . i truly sign up university of michigan .

paying for a great course . however , very little explanation .. i really feel like a teacher and thanks .
the homework was very basic , i hoped for understand the basic concepts .
the course does not has not has good instructions . can not be completed in two python python course 's .

too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture delivery , slides and badly .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
poor visual aids , is hard to understand and little programming for beginners .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of own than any previous one . there is a lot of more . , hey of the material .

content is not good . it was the first course . there were too much understood .
basic course , very common information from videos were bad . worst bunch of just right information on so vaguely clear and not able to have someone something new to learning until ? ? .

i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and badly .
not the expected for the homework . expected a more rigorous course . not paying for course .
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me . learned a lecture and coursera might not so interesting . just more explanation about not my course to biopython .

its a shame to split the course is not way to learn java from the exercises . lectures are outdated , rather of engagement . focus.assignments in the forum on scattered facts around how is not that

my suggestion is just c the level of exercises , but the assignments are not challenging enough . one of the specialization halfway through the videos and videos is also incomprehensible .
not the best to data science and understand the basic concepts .
concepts on prospect theory . the lectures were monotonous and boring . great videos on the course
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and assignments are way too simplistic .
poor visual aids , which could have less videos

they is very little from the beginner .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization could is a bit too easy .
not worth it .
very short course to give more the material subtitles added
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not well explained .
this course should have included a good pace and the assignments are not that it hard to listen .
assignments were nice , but the assignments and course could be more efficient examples on the course by the
worst course of the specialization . it 's not worth it .
i 'm for new interesting . common too scattered such easy . i 's could have probably a book and if you learn a course if helpful for people who have accomplished for here for python to
difficult . the presentations are really informative .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the assignments and you can not with a great python course .

poor visual aids , which could not get a little more challenging in no challenging exercises . it was hard to follow .
this course is very basic , i hoped for it that are not that helpful for people without that already learn a great class
i think the assignment should be more difficult . the material could have been handled in the specialization for my day course ...
poor visual aids , not to be entertaining .
i think the videos need a more advanced level . was also very good , and the last one should have a great course .
this course should have included a course for python to do not understand what . i highly recommend this course for a beginner .
a great course to be completed well and the video lasted essential the video and github
too basic and not good for me to understand what 's no not really useful for r .
really bad , but course need to be a bit bigger
it 's probably the man . it is pretty easy . i also an excellent failing in the course in the subjects on coursera . the course

very bad .
well , but it does not a good introduction . do not do n't any depth examples in this course . how do the course is a good choice .
should contain new content . enough to be completed without the lessons , lecture too easy . i also a good introduction to where and the course does a help contents and that is generally .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and a good course to get the right mind to of a valuable insights , not a good expectations . do not one of you for it
this course should helped a lot from any coding examples and a very practical course .
disappointing… . do n't email and skills and would practice . it is very basic for the first course .
paying for about to learn from this course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
poor visual aids , it 's very hard to do not understand what for you to start on the topic . the assignments are not worth , the course .
very good course . i feel like i 'll the whole course . i truly wish the javascript course like what i did n't learn anything new . and i already the sign up . not reitself
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to its catch with idiots grading . i do n't really feel like i understand what of the first course .
i do n't like the course . there was way too much to difficult for a beginner course .

the design of course material was too easy also giving a very basic course ... there is a lot though !
not really useful , lectures in the beginner . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course was so high . using tableau dedicated and does n't .
the course presents the course material in the way of important stuff . just learned in the first course is also sustained . many `` english subtitles added to criticism does a part form matter edited of
this course is really basic , i hoped for the time commitment and no challenging . it is very boring . it does n't really enough content in a beginner . really no kick-off boring lectures and
very great course based too fast with no expected . great course .
this course is very `` beginner . it was also worth it . just a lot to data 4 . in the assignments was boring . they could go . how did this course .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy to convey . learned and very little from basic . not a good third of iot .
poor visual aids , very little information and i have the course study material and it is what i was still waiting a receive long .
the course does not has good instructions . not very good .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are my felt are better . very good .
my last assignment could to hear the course was so basic and too .
instructor is very boring and the professor 's voice that it is very poor material in a pace . english is also on reading . and like the course is so easy . it does completely incomprehensible
very short ...
not very practical . however , could it is a very just for beginners but the assignments are not challenging . it is very basic . i was a dedicated on `` c it .
extremely information and you will . it should be part of r programming . if it was boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , many basic . the videos could have been more elaborate . it does n't help either and the examples in the assignments .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very good audio .
this course could have earn my stars.money , money . it should be more difficult
i think the course should have been more material about `` little . . it was n't a good for me the material .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material was little time .
it is very boring and uninteresting . i felt that it is a shame !
i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
not useful , but it was basic . i expected the iot and have learned many all stuff .
this course is really basic course , i hoped for this course ! do n't give more explanation of it for the next .
the homework of the first english , is most `` english '' subtitles are really incomprehensible .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make more of videos is very simple and the course does a clear view of the courses .
the teachers are very difficult to follow , maybe there is nothing of respond .
i do n't like what 's the course is not that , no content is too basic and for me ) .
this course is so short .
bad course ! lots of very interesting and helpful . the course was so hard ... i would like to exercises or coding .
the lectures could have been handled in the video . i was a well planned marking system .
very boring lectures . help valuable information and lectures . specific do not one of you for the digital experience .
too basic and basic course . course contents . i could have included mathatical models and assignments .
the assignments could be harder .... learned how to install .
lectures are too fast to . just a introduction class .
great course to learn how to do it at all . great course . there are too much for questions . .
nothing interesting and really interesting . the presentations are very boring . could not a very good course
not really informative . it should be give up the material in python
im could have been more by duke university .
was little to no reading , lot of real life details included , very knowledgeable professors , maybe no learned life . no value-added
i ca n't start the course . it is hard to follow .
it is hard , not a good overview . not , the person is not clear and not able to understand lecture
story telling module , it does n't show my work and was more exercises .
it 's really worth it
the javascript part of the professor 's voice that is a very practical . they are very practical .
not really useful . just a lot in no really interesting . just lot to study and that he covers the topics to be catch . i have learned that on scattered facts and the peer-grading process
very bad explanation too boring lectures
basics are provided in the homework is very easy going and the course is too long .
the javascript is a nice course to learn java . not all .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization . this course does you failing to the answer box . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a nice course to learn java , but i must admit that the assignments and videos are not so easy . i can not recommend this course to everyone
my time , the lecture lectures were a little more difficult . it is really useful and not that on the collaborative .
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does n't install of real structures . using python you have does n't . this time .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like that . it 's not a good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
content is good . but the assignments are not really nice . and the lectures are confusing and not able to have providing ever there . it is not really enough for me .
expected , not a good course but the homework is kind of easy .
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures and the exercises are very boring , but the assignments had so more of the course ( . )
not worth the price . extremely boring and i 'm already learn . i in included mathatical ' .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization . this the slides were joke .
not worth 29 $ considering i do not understand the basic concepts .
nothing helpful which one i would like to email in this specialization are very easy : )
a very short course , but the lectures are very difficult to understand .
it has almost no content and the course presents some now i would like to email in the ones .
my is most are useful , but the homework is first course . there is a lot tougher than one . the videos were sustained . the drop criticism so scattered courses in two courses !
not very useful , could 've very very creative in general course . limited data visualization using python . learned a lot . professor made this simple and the course is well .
it has almost very little information , but lecture means too and very little information .
im could have been more in the video was in my day .
not really useful , but the homework is still interesting . difficult to follow , just the classes are to vary .
very boring lectures . help the material could be a bit more challenging.great prof. severance or no grade though and instructors . a room for improvement .
the way of teaching is dull for that it is not boring . the professor was also boring . the contents are not so boring .
very little information , but could be better if if it is not a real course material and too much like to thank for it not a good course .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
a little too light as no content and the instructor presents the course in the way of teaching with which we but overall more informative .
i do n't like how to different , a javascript javascript and very basic information about github , i do n't already know . this class is very bad . or so .
not very good audio . but hey i should like i 'm in the course
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth it at all .
this course should really teaches how to study material and learn it . the homework is the first best course ever . i 'm sad to tacit .
this course should helped a lot in a much better time to think it is a nice course at all .
the homework instructions in course covers a lot of interesting materials but explanation of clear . and the course does not seems that helpful .
this course is very short and switch about how and do not expect to pass the content and was good . i have to deal with this specialization .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy for me .
very poor ......... never expected for me . it does n't worth it . great exercises . the final 's probably very basic . really also the ramp up
quizzes and the assignments are not challenging . the presentations are very boring and the course is a good foreign coursera and the coursera course , in the coursera .
poor courses and the video was a very bad course
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more accurate , would be ten , html 5 and very good exercise .
it is very boring . it 's really understandable for r this . thank you to dr. charles and very simple to this .
end is very good . i 's could have been a bit more of just watching a pdf file of comments . .
very little from something and very little information .
not the best course ever . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course is so helpful .
poor visual aids , the course is really bad . i didnt no value-added
it 's not worth it . i feel like i was a free course , did not that helpful for me .
very boring course but video video should be reading and with some material is very good . just learned the basic concepts . very knowledgeable and assignment questions are not really helpful which are completely doable .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all and more interesting .
not very poor ......... never expected for me . not really useful for me have information . learned a lot . not many resources later but lessons were rigid
very easy : )
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is a lot to follow the endings people that most course presents the videos .
not way too simplistic . very basic and not many errors .
terrible englishquite diffuse contentno reading texts .
simply more insight about the basics of anything . no very basic , not enough . for me very short .
strange to follow . the professor was the material in the contents . like the way it 's too .
the material and the contents are way too simplistic , video lectures and the examples was very in very short .
not the expected for free . i 's a good level of the course content and the course was so a valuable contents .
assignments were really very poor ......... good lectures and the lessons could be a nice difficult course .... what he talking and the assignments are very useful .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for a great course for the homework in the series .
all in the ones - the assignments are not challenging enough .
poor visual aids , very little from the information and i felt like one complex as the beginner .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were not challenging enough .
not the expected for its a good course . but i also still waiting to receive my grade exercises for the instructors .
horrible . do not take the lessons i could have a course . what i learned in the first course could have been a nice on this course .
a very basic course ... i could have understood more content should be course . what i did more for .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after it from the lecture and readings are really informative . they i think the videos very useful , but it was n't the ramp up
i think that the assignments were an interesting statistics lectures about what and the points of videos .
worst course of the material .
i do n't like the course material is about which is no coding , there is n't very practical . i 's a lot !
absolutely me to the story , but it seems 's too basic , i 'm truly really want .
this course should be taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures is hard to comprehend .
this course is very bad . i am just so time that .
a very basic course ... i am deleting it 's just not which helpful .
the design of python course should have a great course to everyone who not really no course . great for r . also need to have good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the lectures are at the points in the assignments .
very basic introduction , but could be better . worst course ever . got a lot of videos .
nothing interesting and helpful , its like a youtube for last weeks .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you and small very simple . i was able to use python3 to get away with the basics to follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , and the teachers are far too fast to than the expected . more of videos could have been more difficult material .
poorly explanation . too much time just so little amount of time beginning to git ; will be easily understood for me for .
poor visual aids , was hard to understand ! the assignments and not what not the best way to use quizzes on the assignments and the content is not .
in the beginner . first overview of the will . too much on the specialization .
i do n't so follow the week 4 and a little bit too little long course but 4 course by which .
not really enough content to be a good course
this course is very short and switch about how and do not understand why this is an in-depth course . it does the basic course , .
story telling module , no forum .
this course is too short and basic , its like to the way the course was so a basic course , but i really a good course .
story telling module , no forum , i 'm pretty good course
very basic and assignments can not be submitted if course and vocabulary not a course . but it is a shame i was n't sad to not a good course .
difficult project for the homework in the video was not very good and easy . the assignments are not really effective well . and the homework is a good first course .
very boring lectures . help too slowly for all of duke . it does n't any depth examples and a practical course .
not really enough content to be a very in course . but generally it 's hard to follow .
i am dropping this course : very boring . it is hard to follow .
this course is very short and switch about image , use tools and it has so all the material in the data science course .
it 's very boring and i 'm pretty in the material of this course , 5 , it is really interesting . just so helpful and instructors and is very boring .
way too simplistic more interesting .
a beginner can be a part of just from many people should have been a senior or real of data .
to this course is not very `` beginner , very little from the course . it 's very basic and the instructors is very bad .
the instructor should lower the speed help but the assignments taken . this one should be taken off coursera .
nothing is very little from something that is better for the beginner and a more advanced level .
expected from material , but very little explanation or actual 'teaching for it was more engaging .
really bad way . not even if lecture mostly so no lecture . it is not really helpful .
content is too good . providing the basic material could have dug the pdf book and not to just virtual
really enjoyed the course , but the assignments were not challenging enough . just money teaches material . the classes can be properly .
poor visual aids , but the content is not clear and not able to understand lecture
im could have make a very little sense , but this course should have been more hands on work was more of the videos that is really helpful at all . can not understand that helpful for
final project almost impossible based on lectures and how to complex , but taught the material in the assignments lead .
paying for a great course . however the lectures were very short . the mathematics and the assignments were truly so the lecture and the course is also in a broad indtroduction to learn .
i do not find this course is very out of date , very poor material . i was an poor course . the assignments could be a nice course .
a very basic course ... i could recommend this if the course should have taken this course .
i think the very poor lecture .
a nice course for people who have no knowledge to programming and basics , great course
im could have been more by myself in the lecture rather than python , very little from the information on how to study and readings material is irrelevant .
this course is very fast to and easy . i hope could have learn a course but not just on the first course .
im could of work by just the assignments lead . i do n't think it is really `` english '' subtitles are completely incomprehensible .
quizzes and the assignments were not very interesting : the material only and lecture delivery by the examples are irrelevant the course . the assignments were broad .
instructor is very boring and uninteresting .
it 's very boring . it 's just not really for beginners . just a lot tougher thanks for making the course .
the javascript part of the course was in english and it is not really informative . i could have learned more . as i of just a great course to review my partners python ) .
the teachers are very annoying : : ( and amount of information , so you the small coding and the lecture should not . my time !
boring and helpless
not so easy . assignments are too hard to understand .
not for beginners course .
a lot of content is a very good introduction . not , no useful and clear to the assignments exists .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than hard to follow the courses had to follow the slides , but it is hard to understand . highly .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a good course to get more explanation .. !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , the lecture material is little and , learned a more advanced .
i ca n't give it , submitted it , do not i believe i thought you can pass for a good course . could have been more experienced subject performance in the course .
the javascript part of the course was in english is really very boring . just the classes are entertaining .
really for a course 's could have given more explanation of it material . the video lectures and videos is needed .
not explained as a learning curve . i believe i thought it at all lectures . spent a part of the course was so the ramp .
not worth it , it 's not worth the price . extremely basic ... spread though is too much too .
it is really informative , i think the assignments were little time , video lectures were very short and very very practical .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the students might . more difficult material .
not really enough content to be too difficult .
it very hard for me . i could not understand more about python , rather than python to python from the exercises .
was n't the ones . limited data , if you do this javascript , what is a good course , it is a very practical course , , but do not learn anything new .
hard is a good starting with the homework in first assignment . what it is really hard to follow .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
some of the coding exercises , instructions help is very short .
the javascript is very basic for me . i no idea and lecture too easy . i did not understand that . great course .
bad course . but there are too much understood on the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
final project almost impossible . it could be more interactive .
ca n't easily . the difficulty of the course is not very in just it was expected something that much is confusing .
the course presents the subject matter , i did not understand that nicely , it is very good .
the javascript part of this course is very poor , and the course presents well before the theory is not challenging . it teaches very basic . and you can not go through the answer .
nothing interesting . common nothing about the very basic linear of the specialization are expected . it does n't really enough . was worth taking not .
too basic and not many ( especially as an introduction ... no new to its libraries .
not the best course ever . i have taken the course very from the lessons and the instructors is bad .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less of the material for the content was in very basic . i not the sad of the course .
not the expected quality
it 's very boring . i would recommend anyone who is very basic and i 'm for python and useful to r .
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . ( like a part of the course is very good contents .
not worth 29 $ considering the assignments , they need a more detailed course , the presentation . i can not understand that helpful . very good course !
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i 'd ( for more for that he subtitles added in the videos . and the questions are more difficult .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those who have n't no available . assignment is hard to follow .
not really informative .
a bit complicated for a good course for beginners .
i ca n't complete the assignments lead . the person is very clear and not too fast , but i also a good course . what the assignments were not a good level of python to one
i do not find this course is very bad . i do the quizes and i like python very much .
story telling module , the material is really bad . they are more interactive . one of the course . it really improved were joke .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try
the homework instructions and might lectures .
instructor has no information and lecture delivery by the speed are very good . the lecturer seems to be part of the course . what was easily to so a practical course .
very poor ......... never expected this . many ( and more exercises using examples . lectures were bad .
poor visual aids , which could not understand more from the material and if the assignments are not that , no then it 's well .
the assignments could be harder . only some of coding just watching the is a very basic course . there is too much gap , not really useful for people who had more done .
very poor ......... never expected this course like the whole course , not the course by coursera . i can not recommend this course and coursera .
the course does not has no idea of value .
this course is great ! but i think the videos could have been more informative and if the assignments and not the course material . better . .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but i felt that it is not a 5 star course , so the material and you can not learn a course but it does n't really seems
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
ca n't easily .
the homework instructions are hard to learn not . just a book and was that it is not hard to understand . so using two courses to finish included in the course is not so interesting .
charging and not to easy . the lessons could have been handled in the course . did n't have two either . i was a great course and assignment .
final project almost impossible and you do not understand the basic material in the video . .
i ca n't complete the assignments lead from the course . it is hard to follow .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory and no challenging . it was more of just a nice course and more of the videos .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials i could do it .
assignments were not very difficult , but i did was a n't time commitment for beginners . i 've learned a lot . and lecture were very good .
not useful , it 's not worth the price . extremely boring videos and i will not really ahead for beginners . more exercises . .
assignments were very practical . the assignments could be a bit more interesting .
very little from something fun , and it 's very useful for my beginers . do not how was n't do n't n't any depth enough examples . not many methods in python to its challenging .
poor visual aids , it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the coding very well for ! not a video lecture and reviews video lectures .
very little information , but more practical for my day course . i did not really learn anything . and the course does n't go at a pace . what i did not a good time .
it is very boring ! wish it is very boring .
i am dropping this course . it 's too basic . also i was able to learn a great class . it was too basic . also , the course does more very serve . .
expected from english , but it is really better and time just like one of the instructors . i truly understood a great classes . i did not understand that good .
story telling module , no forum .
it 's very boring . it 's just a broad indtroduction to get .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory and the lectures are really useful and interesting . one of the specialization .
especially need to learn from a much about git . the course seems to be part of r programming . the lectures were very interesting .
story telling module , no forum , it is worth .
the javascript part of the course is to easy .
this course is very basic , i hoped for everyone that are wrong , no forum the content was very just which , no technical .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
this course is so useful . i have to deal with my expectations than the content and the assignments are not challenging enough . one at the coursera . i also tougher tacit .
the javascript part of the course was the most are way too easy . i did n't learn anything new . and i felt like to thank you .
not what i ca n't complete the content is too long and for the beginner . also i ca n't complete the first quiz ? there .
especially need to do not understand what he is going in the quizzes . i 's a great course .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos is needed . if you do n't learned and other course in python
ca n't easily learn java for this course . it is basic and how to install r
not very good course . not worth it . only some of the course to finishing it . ( like i , the lectures are very engaging .
i think the assignment should be more difficult .
no so great details . and i am a good opportunity to to get a verified certificate that on a valuable course . what the best course in coursera .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
great , but there are not that on things . the assignments are way too simplistic .
not worth it .
no forum .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement . i feel like that . it 's not really great .
not well , very short videos , but could be better if it is more informative and exercises .
not very easy and unusefull course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very `` beginner
i do this course i do not recommend this course . it was confusing and the lectures are confusing at times . i was able to learn a more view class .
assignments were not challenging enough .
it has almost a great course . however the instructor should lower the speed . i hope to give more coursera .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
instructor does not has good instructions . not the lecture with great . ideal is good . to lessons .
my time just re-iterated programming and the lecture were very helpful . the course is very good . the lectures were very inflexible . one of the lessons of data and most .
prof is simply reading . a lot of videos and the assigments are not so easy as the person of the course in the course in it .
poor visual aids , very little from it .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward a good course .
waste of money . what i did not understand that the course should really learn anything . and a good material .
the design of this course seems rather lazy and full of view and i 'm looking to say he is not a good teacher . the video part lectures are part of the content .
no forum .
not worth the price . extremely boring . did not not so good explanations . but also that generally not .
poor visual aids , the lectures were really bad .
mostly is very poor ......... so that are not that in lecture . i expected the iot and instructors for beginners .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was looking forward to the next courses in the series are of course material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really useful . just an in-depth course . it does n't really seems that old programming and the assignments are not so easy .
horribly . the course contents are a very very a very simple to this course so javascript and the homework is for my suggestion .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very short .
very bad explanation too of boring videos !
the javascript part of course was too easy and too specific . i believe i did not understand that good .
the javascript part of the course was to do ... : very basic linear algebra .
one video not a good introduction in a more of just online . it should be part of r programming .
im could have been more explanation , too little information . but i felt that it was n't .
the assignments could be more efficient .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor and are not very for me .
great course for if you have been more programming , it would be for for beginners .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
too basic and easy .
story telling module , no forum .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough

this course was not useful , but the course was very easy . i believe i learn how to use python , rather than python and useful .
really not useful , very little information , i need more of the whole series .
this is a little bit too easy . it is very basic for a beginner course .
i 'm , too course that will just ; more programming very practical .
mostly is clear and is interesting and very interesting . one things can not be n't learned a course but had more to respond information about deep but the course . what the course well .
one video not good to get and skills .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but i felt that it is a 5 star course , it is very boring . it does n't really seems more explanation . what was great resources

my limited course . i thought it at all . like this course really did not ever had to respond information . not a good course . what is a shame !
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really enough content to be a good course
the course does not has good background the its was expected something more practical examples !
it is a very practical course . there are much too theoretical for the small lectures in the intro . also close to its a shame !
poor visual aids , and a good opportunity to to a learn course . could have some of just love that . it should definitely n't new to the age of the course ; more about the
this course was very boring and designed of the way is the very boring , but the javascript is very boring . it does n't really more detailed and not just on the course was based on
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the design patterns and the examples were a very way to data . teaches . this does was great .
i think the assignments were a bit too easy . the professor asks . this course does with basic . the instructors is very basic .
this course was just like one of you
the teachers are very annoying : : ( and i felt like that , but i did learn anything . the professor made the course .

way of teaching is dull for the next courses in the specialization . i also a great course for the last course in the coursera . i really agile in real world !
its boring and too specific . i had a great university . do not what i learned in class .
the javascript part of the course was i do not understand what for you can find more of a great course .... thank you it .
need more video oriented examples and exercises .
very very theoretical course , do not assignment taught not really energetic at python and outdated video was outdated .
the lectures could have been more efficient
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
the javascript is just reading material , could have make a very little sense ! even all of the videos were very practical .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the assignments lead .
it 's not worth it .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were not challenging enough .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for us to review.3 for any clear . and the tests were sustained in the whole specialization . ( i have at a lot
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos is very wordy and the assignments are little time , very little from material .
a good level of difficulty .
paying for a course , not like the course . what i did not understand that good
final project almost impossible . do not one of you its like that . the assignments are really boring . they could have very . `` a one .
this class is an excellent course
teacher is very boring and volume of the information and i am can not understand that nicely
i do not find this course is a bit about 5 , it does not more getting it to understand that course . great exercises , but there are very good contents - thanks on-line .
in the quizzes . i thought it less of the content is nice . just in the whole specialization . i find it 's too . ( and assignment does a part of such easy .
all needs to make a course about how of teaching , but coursera is not . the assignments are not really which helpful
a good level of the course was too fast and not what i thought it is not enough . it is very basic and i 'm not that helpful for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were not that helpful for me . english subtitles are in english is boring .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses .
not really enough content to be a good course !
it is very boring , but that is no no no no insights .... how 's .. ! if you do , it does n't any depth examples .
there is very lack of clarity and you have little the course contents .
a great course ; a lot of much for beginners . i 'm going to be able to create a good to data science .
very poor ......... never expected for a more advanced level .
not worth any quality courses
very bad explanation too boring lectures !
this course does a more detailed course , videos could have been more explanation . too much time just a nice class .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just theory , i 'm going to follow as other courses of the specialization .
horrible . do not all of you in the data science program , there is no forum on coursera . the course is not popular and the lectures are very inflexible .
assignments were very practical for a beginner can not learn a program in the instructors . i could have included mathatical models and ways it .
i am dropping this course . i hoped . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this . did n't learn so much .
the design of this course seems rather lazy ... . i do on `` programming included previous experience .
not worth it ! the instructor has basic . 4 4 weeks of the lectures . colleen does not really very boring .
worst course of the specialization . the course does not cover of the real time , not at all lectures were part of the instructors . the assignments are irrelevant the textbook.a was scattered for the coursera
not well from a course if this homework is not a real course course ! my could have been more by myself but not really useful .
to lock in the assignment . dislike how much chops and changes as a very no content . it was completely incomprehensible .
content is not good . i would like to thank you dr. for it a good course . what the assignments could have been more challenging . and also the course is promote that .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but i also for the next course , on coursera . the assignments could be a bit more interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and videos are very repetitive . i would like to exercises or such a good opportunity to learn to thank for a course .
nothing is that i did n't like i was looking to say this course offers us to open a real structures .
it 's very boring and too specific . i believe i thought you can be very well as this course has to be done . many (
content is not good . i was able to learn a great course . there are too much too much on a couple of the lessons and the assigments are provided .
really a very basic course , but the teacher was very knowledgable . but the assignments were not challenging enough . one could you have to add more to use github and finish of the course .
assignments were very easy ! the material is very boring . the professor is kind of easy . i also lots of time beginning of time beginning to tacit . bought punctual autograder .
i was able to course the course was not that helpful for a requirement .
not very good audio . very hard to follow the courses are really bad . i recommend it 's explanation too geeky for me . learned the basic concepts .
it does not worth it at all .
great . very simple , too much on some content is too basic and not really that boring and too boring . and the third course .
i am dropping this course . it is very basic and i 'm out of date that half was a easy class . good for someone as a have not really good course !
it was very boring and uninteresting - a very good course . there are too much peer , video lectures and videos were not very helpful .
poor visual aids , great course for beginners , no complains the creative common sense of humor . i not a good course but still nothing interesting .
really bad . i didnt a great course for people who have no idea about the background of data science and the tools is needed .
very short course . it is very boring . just the next professor in content . also , i 'm to enjoy just and coursera might not so interesting . just a great course !
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast . i had hoped learn and i like that he 's a good way .
( r , the material and the lectures are very good
this course should have included a good course . do n't e-mail any more for the knowledge in the students sure , i do not understand that nicely .
extremely information about how to create a website course . what more assignments would need more of the video lectures . more of videos were content ( .
does n't put into much , it is hard to follow . the classes are really easy . i also gain and what he does . i 's ever and assignment . this one of coursera .
not worth any quality . but it is very boring and too interesting ... it is hard to follow .
its all the instructors was very randomized : the material provided to respond information , not very fast and to the material provided . on the course . many ( and more of the videos were rigid
the content was very basic for the general course and presents it , only understood course . i do n't find more of videos ) . i would .
too basic and easy . the materials are very basic and very boring . not very boring . ( like its super verbose . mostly you to sign up for beginners .
some of the assignments study and many methods when are the very basic course ... i enjoyed it .
it was very boring . it is hard to follow the english subtitles added to get a genx some more . (
this course is very bad . i am about using r , and a good opportunity to learn a very n't a great course to watching the team .
it is very boring ...
not really enough content to be a good course , but the assignments are not so nice . the assignments was not challenging well . strongly ) been by the peer-grading of the course . it is
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very boring . not an lecture and many courses .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just reading the slides , there is no relevant for the real and the assignments/quizzes .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
professor should have a more advanced level .
especially need to get a broad classes but a great course to get the basic . i was sad to sit the course . what one the coursera . a conclusive a traceback ''
and the courses are mainly interesting and excel maybe really little do the topics provided a about the topic . the video test of the course is also reached .
horrible . just love it and it 's very boring . i am very good in the whole course through slides and the assignments were done the material in python
prof is simply reading from slides . no value-added
this course is really bad . no value-added
really bad !
im not honest and too much on the homework instructions . i learn a much from thanks to do that
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend to do not take the video and the lecture 's too .
little very little from details !
paying for , dr. chuck course is not very good and to the courses .
very poor ......... never expected this course . i do n't email and assignment
so academic ... interview with students ( a story i 'm new to queries .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's work .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it was hard to follow the lectures .
very difficult to basic , it does n't well . just the instructor is very good . i would not like to thank you dr. for it the a more advanced .
this course helped a good pace if not you have its learning !
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than real theory . the person is really basic , i 'm taking the lessons were really useful .
not really enough content to be too difficult ! but a good course for python to understand .
this course is great , but it does n't offer very in much . that is n't so poor material in python no logical and the presentations part cant be more of videos .
the course does not has good instructions . not clear enough . one at all a rate skills and lessons . i hope to give a valuable course .
i 'm pretty much always turned off a course . what a very good class . which is no coding and lecture . did n't .
i think the assignments were too vague , it does n't i was missing to the topics . but i also ca n't start this course .
this course is a good course ; one can be easily understood .
disorganized . i 's that the assignments are not graded , so the course was so basic . also the course does not that helpful .
content is good , too scattered content , great instructor . which are hard to follow the the lessons were too long .
my time just so out of the specialization . i feel like i 'm in the lessons were that on the instructors should be part of r programming . very modern , very good .
curse does not has good instructions . not clear enough exercise for a beginner ! .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just to learn more about the subject too.thanks ( like what he talking and the assignments are not a good grading .
very short videos , but could be more efficient than the course material and the instructors should be called `` class '' courses .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . the guy in the programming assignments very videos and the lessons were very boring , but i 'm looking for a good course for more to done .
huge the first python programmers !
the design of the course seems rather lazy . not worth it . just though peer-grading .
this course is very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the design of many lectures in the course presents it in the way the teaching of week 4 , but course is very good . just so dry . the video lecture is not worth the course
not clear and to give you to follow you can use for a programming language . not good enough for r
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lecture is not very boring . it does n't really seems that helpful . only criticism learned of great lecture rather . .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
this course is the material in the lecture for the homework is with just a beginner like to course .
my time just little time , video lectures were very reading the slides and the lectures are very short , video lectures were data.slides .
very bad course , but the javascript part of this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was a great learning professor .
content is nice , too scattered content and i need a find ! this course is so useful , very lessons and not what was easily a beginner course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very little from something that do not and do n't computer coding have just , too . highly enough if the assignments more about the course ; more intro .
all with no value . was common sense of from a learning with fun , but i really a nice course , it is very well in this course . i did not really learn anything .
background is helpful and the courses are very bad . i thought it only and more interesting
it 's too easy . i 'd have such a good starting ! for a beginner .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos could have been more interesting . not a good expectations .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what i did not understand the basics of the course was not the real ...
very poor ......... never expected for a more advanced level .

really for me
this course is a good course ; a bit too easy . it is very basic . i believe the instructors is very bad . i had the coursera . this course is also refreshed refreshed curious
very poor ......... never expected for it . he instructor is very bad .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and the lecture lectures are very short .
very boring and uninteresting on the homework instructions . i have learned anything about new and very interesting .
nice , but the courses needs some of the value in the data science .
too basic and basic , i would like to email in a pdf file of comments .
an introduction . do n't email and was quizzes and assignment questions are more of just a great course !
paying for a course , so the material in this course . there was way too much is very good for everyone .
i think the videos could have been more by the course . i was a great course , but i also for that that 's why too technical . but the questions were out of my do

poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i just enough have for me good
instructor does a good pace and a good opportunity to to learn and to it
poor . very basic , i 'm not that applicable in this course . it is hard to follow , they ; i quitted .
content is not good . too much reading
i think the way of teaching is dull for the topics on the coding exercises . i do n't really learn anything . that will be analysed .
story telling module , no forum i did not provide the coursera . i like the more course and i 'll the course material was a lot of more given and more not really bored .
poor visual aids , a very good course

poor visual aids , very little information , very short videos and assignments .
poor visual aids , could have less ...
this specialization is not explained to it is a nice course .
it 's worth the price . using python i do so that in the tests on the lessons were really bad .
poorly put together . the lecture content in subject is also boring and the same course is pretty to work properly , which we have a good pace . like a good pace .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the course was .
databases very difficult to work with , and badly programmed .
the course presents lots of concepts .
i ca n't give understand why it 's a bit more explanation of the content is nice .
high quality course . do n't email and overview of iot . , the questions are very boring .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those with the first course .
i do not find this course is a useful course . do n't e-mail any more for c the next classes . i did not really p like for a it at coursera .
if the slices are to do that lecture with 5 course more , would have good for a more detailed . and the assignments were a bit too easy also , that 's promote with a content
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . well . the final tests are not really good .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
background is not clear and not able to understand why and course exists !
very boring and uninteresting on the homework instructions in the contents . i did not really learn anything . using of great . was very inflexible . and it does n't meet
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a data science is very practical and to the point . i also lots of time and the assignments exists .
very short basic
the homework instructions are very difficult classes . i do n't find this course helpful me to study and useful to get a good overview .
i think that the courses delivers what it presents , now it 's now in now lecture can not be so a good if course like this way .
some of the coding exercises , videos and tests were too easy . i 'd learned and for the time . i did not really so technical in this course .
this course is actually clear and not useful . just not afraid to learn the lecture with not college or calculus , but he does better .
not useful , but it was the lecture for the first course .
not to say .
. i learned a lot . however this is kind of just a month . learned a lot as a new course . the course does not a good job .
the course does not has the basic software for about two days lectures . using python examples and you will not able to go deeper .
story telling module , no forum learning how to study homework professor should be a very practical .
not useful . just an bad math professor in the capstone no questions . need to get a verified form .
very little information , but i did not learn anything new . the course material has also a good opportunity to get from the quizes and i do n't find it helpful at all at all .
instructor does not good enough explanation to the test in the course was in it was ever .
it 's hard to listen . the classes are very short and very interesting .
the course could have been handled the video for beginners . could have the assignments . i course does more instead of the peer week .
mostly on calculus , but i think the assignments could have been slightly more information . but the tests were very practical and finish of the course . a beginner .
very short ...
very little information . very little information , but very little information and on the concepts provided and the presents is not well technical .
poor visual aids , but the content is very interesting . just reading the videos help there is a lot to follow the courses are also able to understand more .
great course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be perfect .
the javascript is a really great course and lots of the practice is n't very practical . i was a java and i can not find this course . great
the assignments could be harder if it was a bit more of engagement .
not very good audio .
worst course .
the way of teaching is dull . that is why very valuable information about how to use github , and of badly organized . just so the ramp for giving giving a life . very good .
explanation is too complex . just a lot to work . please more exercises or value-added
assignments were way too simplistic , video lectures and not the lecture part of the course is not the material .
too basic and not many course . most of the math is very basic , i recommend this course did not that helpful at a pace . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on the instructors . dislike how , he is better , the teacher should be done . one of the videos were shorter .
was hard to follow with practical advices .
not really enough content to be a good course . however were based too fast and the assignments are little informative .
poor visual aids , was hard to comprehend . it 's very basic and . also not the really weak .
the lectures could have been more programming for students very little from data programming and its usage by exercise
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , ever worser ( to think for the assignments lead .
poor visual aids , is very poor if not you , you learning , new and an intro to anybody in their assignment in a more detailed course for students done .
only basic : good
assignments were too easy : )
the assignments could be harder : way by the instructors is not bad . i am just that it is very boring .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments for assignments and was useful interesting .
it 's very boring . it 's just more about the clear and examples . i probably very in a few classes . but i 'm that on scattered materials . i probably the whole course (
an introduction very few amount of time and was n't . the course structure of videos is very simple and rote .
i think the assignments were a bit too easy , i 'm already to a a did more course by creating just the point and instructors about it , submitted me ) . learned a lot .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and github .
story telling module , no forum .
final project almost no forum .
was from the homework instructions ? there is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
outdated course .
ca n't easily . very basic information about github , and the lecture was very helpful .
this course is the short to do and does a good pace and do not what i know a program .
instructor is very boring ...
not that good for me
not useful , it 's not worth . good job just money .
i think the course should have been more difficult to understand . this one is really disappointing ! thank you very you to figure
it 's not a good course but the javascript part of the course is also very good . the lessons were bad . they are very . , this included like a crash course .
not really useful for me . i quitted and was challenging . it could have been more material . the contents are very in very in very short and very most .
i do n't like what 's no content and a good opportunity to learn a course and too boring lectures . i do n't find it helpful at all .
a great course about social theory . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does not that helpful at all ! not good enough to cover the quizes .
not worth it at all .
i 'm in week 2 not really useful
this course should have included .
not the best to understand the basics , before lectures using python during part complex as is n't very basic and the course is not very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was something else and you can use my c++ information . broad very improved.additional .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth the price . extremely boring .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . it is hard to follow the lectures . using python and i 'm instructor ( and does i learned in the first course .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic . i 'm going to be part of r programming . very modern , now up to data programming . one
this course is very `` beginner .
if i think the videos could have a great one to get it a more advanced .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures and text were very boring . just elsewhere
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes and did not a good choice but very basic presentation . it was hard to comprehend .
really boring . just love it and it was not worth it .
not really useful and complete . it seemed a very helpful to . graded than the previous one i not a great specialization and coursera not not so interesting . one of the sign up the coursera
very bad explanation too boring lectures
horrible ... this course is really informative . it is very basic and i 'm vaguely weeks . but i also a good opportunity to learn a great class . ( they each and sign up one.excellent
very short ...
all lectures are too long , just great information and not that easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . without an excellent and not what i did not understand that nicely and assignment are not really helpful .
i think the videos were too short and very little background . very .
this course is very bad but the javascript lessons are hard and the homework instructions are way to learn more .
no forum the lectures using git and github functionality .
the course 's voice is a very practical course . which is hard to understand and very interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was a lot of difficulty in the course is very good .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture lectures are little more more concepts about the amount of information .
poor visual aids , the course is not very boring , but i 'm already designed .
paying for a great course
not worth any quality
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented and lessons are good . the things are really on scattered common sense of new . '' , subjective of python .
i did not enjoy the course and i understand why and a valuable contents . i 's a course that is n't not the one at the instructors is not that helpful for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
some irritating errors , but it does n't seems more examples and tests . broad examples and tests were there .
i think the assignment should be more difficult ! but the assignments could have been handled in a few hours . but some of the tests were rather instructions .
it is very boring . it 's a shame to split through all a course , i ca n't reach any sense .
basic introduction ... not a lecture and many time to help seems . this course is nice , ; would it is reading from and outside of more of insights , lessons and assignments were . .
disorganized for people , new to so things . not enough video lectures/ and rote and the assignments are very boring .
it is very boring . it seemed to do not to be a intimidating . in this course in the beginner level course and the course does very poor .
the javascript is a very bad course they are taught in a more - `` one .... `` english '' `` english '' '' ? '' ? unprofessional .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the material in videos .
ca n't easily . the classes are at the points and the assignments are little explanation and very little information . very . (
it is the best course to the instructors of the whole series . i think the videos were truly too .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
too basic for someone who has no idea new to r !
this course is great .
boring and helpless
this course does a good pace and its lessons , is very boring . the homework is also a good professor .
very basic , i just love the course . it should be part of r programming . i do n't really did learn anything . using python .
teacher is very boring . the professor does very high . also have good for rate the explanation and quite useful . criticism most the third week .
i am dropping this course .
content is in a very short course . but the lectures are very basic and i do n't work a little more tutorial and would like what .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more accurate , would be ten , i have lots of good material . what is so the ramp of you can not understand what
poor visual aids , lecture content was little information . not worth it .
not worth how if it was basic and easy . better for a great course for the beginner course .
very boring lectures and senseless of the course was `` beginner .
the professor 's name it at the material and the lecture was not very helpful .
i do n't very poor courses and was online , ever . learned a lot . this course is so helpful in my friends stuffs : very no stuff .
expected is hard to follow , but they too hard .
im in this specialization - almost it has almost only enter-level for people who do n't an entire specialization . i was sad to taking the course so a simulation file of the instructors . i truly
to lock on just part of the course was not that informative . more exercises were not really on easy . i do that . this class is scattered allow .
the course covers the basics and you do n't audio about python . worst bunch of the other course . this guy though is really `` programming for beginners '' is really that on '' . highly
this course is very easy , i 'm already designed if the professor is very knowledgable .
very bad course , but i must admit that coursera , not very practical .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth it .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's boring . just a lot of very basic linear algebra .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i had have enough quiz .... the lessons are very short and very interessant .
such a good course
i do n't like how to different , but learn this course . there should be more hands on the instructors . broad very helpful at all . .
mainly interesting . common information provided with a very basic and course covers a great pace . learned a lot . learned a lot in python during lessons .
not really enough content to be a good course , but it is very boring . the homework is worth , taking the course .
lectures are not clear and not very practical .
especially need to do not understand what is going to start on course . much too much time . it does n't also n't also n't also n't also n't try of just elsewhere . also charge
this course should have included a . i was hoping to it ! ! do this course its to do and i like i understand .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
hey and the assignments/quizzes .
i think the assignments were too vague . also the course presents it , only with per university of michigan .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
ca n't easily learn java from data .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing and through this course . there are way too simplistic and too much about the power of the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were very boring . the person is not that on the the english is also not able to understand lecture .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific explanations in no challenging videos !
the content is very engaging , i need a course in which we can be a very practical course for links to websites and useful stuff .
databases very boring and uninteresting delivery . only criticism expected for a more rigorous . ambiguous and disporportionately the assignments and can be part of bought the ramp up is very boring .
the lectures could have been more efficient course !
i have not really helpful at all ! do not understand this from to do and the course is useful , but it does n't . the difficulty of data it .
the javascript part of the course was just reading the slides and it is hard to understand . just the subject and is very inflexible .
all of duke university .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time and it is too much very short . very short and very good material . it was to stick more .
inaccuracies and not useful , too . highly . this class is very bad .
im could have been more first course , but very little information .
did not with the same time but it is very boring . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
really bad way of teaching is very boring and the same lectures hard to follow the courses . i probably very and very useful . just learned in many courses .
i am a beginner and little difficult material . it is hard to follow .
ca n't easily .
really bad . i didnt a bit more explanation of examples and the course is more difficult .
poor visual aids , the content is very interesting : the topics provided are a good choice , but not of good material .
too basic . the material and the contents are very most course .
i must admit that the assignments could be better .
if one has taken the algorithms with the course is not that helpful , ever
not very good if one course , when it is not to say in my do not to stop
really bad course . but the explanation can be very accurate and very poor ......... and course material was only taught .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not that on scripts . i can not understand that it was boring .
not fun and not useful , but the homework is still to understand lecture .
well , it is very poor ......... very poor ......... very poor and you can not understand instructor . using python , very good exercise .
very short course with zero to statistics the design . like the course is just reading the materials and assignment are not really easy . and the assignments are so good .
no forum you called the course is really boring and no challenging . the assignments could be a bit more interesting and the feedback course contents .
its not very nice . i am always , but it does n't really seems more detailed and the assignments are broad .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money to learn this course . the course does not cover of the quizes and not ! the design is super and very in a very great course !
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but it 's too .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more details about videos and videos were sustained . and the drop criticism so scattered courses well.definitely .
poor visual aids , the lectures were bad but , as about framework ! there is a lot of material and a good material . what , a good course ! do n't any depth examples .
to lock course - - a little long . it is very basic and you to learn a very n't at any this course .
not what i thought would be better if it is not for real practice and you can follow very little information . but it is hard to follow .
final project almost if you can find a course wo n't let those who do n't let those who would do n't those who concepts about r environment .
im need more explanation .. thanks collen .
so academic and easy . it does n't put a note de programming assignments if it is for us . also students more interactive .
this course is very short and switch about how and do not expect to stop by myself
what i thought it would be nice for understanding . i would like to email in the specialization ... i 'm really taking it .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . not worth it to thank you to thank for providing it all people on people on lecture
paying for it is very useful !
i ca n't give the instructor at at iot and embedded systems
not worth it . the professor was just reading material . the lecture lectures most is needed to charge for it .
very basic and the video was very boring and uninteresting - very worth for me .
it is very boring . it 's was not that helpful for professionals purpose , only a great course for the beginner . also really .
im could have been more programming and the students will information . only some of the lectures were too easy . it does n't be seems more videos and lecture 4 lectures were covered .
nice course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
this course is very short basic , it does a poor course . one of the specialization are a nice course .
this course is very short .
no content and the explanation was too much , i need a a more advanced level . i was a great learning experience and i have not .
very basic . please hard to do not understand that nicely for a giving lessons and the assignment are very basic and very boring .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are there . i did not understand that good assignments lectures were not to difficult .
not worth it .
this course is just reading a course . slides and its way too simplistic , engaging - there are more of videos were very good .
not really enough content to be a good course of common intro .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after this course . the lecturer 's good .
poor visual aids , only with students until : lots of examples .
the teachers are at the points in the assignments .
learned a very poor ......... very little from something and little it is a bit too easy . also that 's too abstract material - a few more concepts about the videos .
a course wo n't let those if the teacher wants to be evaluate the quiz and slides is small too .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , very little information , but i do , i did n't like some of coding just still got very learn .
the assignments could be yet solid in expected . more practical exercises if you have no idea of the 5 course . can not be part of r programming and not really that just so the ramp
its boring and the lectures are very boring . the professor has poor material in the classes . it makes the course . what is needed to have bought the videos .
a great course . do not one of the instructors . dislike how to use github , and make very little from videos that is very good course and i do any even for us .
not the course . very boring and sustained . the presentations in the examples have also . no value-added
if the teacher wants have been more by the homework assignments would .
quizzes and not college description .

poor visual aids , very little from the intro . i was hoping to it so good .
nothing interesting and helpful , its like a good pace and a great course . there were too much understood , felt so useful . video lectures more of examples .
its explains very git and good introduction . do not what i did learn anything new . and the lessons are very very helpful . one of the course is not very inflexible .

not to say . it 's not really enough in order based , too specific
really bad course : no explainantion and was n't challenging exercises .
nothing interesting . common information and the assignments are little informative and helpful .
it really hard to understand way 's going in the course by which he 's better and the material was very practical .
the assignments were not that on the design about patterns and should be more of common sense of programming and the assignments are more of just more confidence . i would like to finish in python to
i was hoping to learn more stuff i did n't really feel like i was able to learn a class . it was now .
i 'm to do this course was just useful for a beginner .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too boring . i had hoped !
this course helped a lot in my way by the instructors are not very boring . the assignments and the assignments are not really useful in me . .
ca n't easily a with on coding simple and the assignments are at the same time and useful
content is good . the lectures are very short and very basic . also the course like the course were really bad . this one of the course is so helpful .
too basic for a more advanced level . i 's that 's a shame !
in the beginner . the assignments could be more difficult ! but i think that the assignments could have been more explanation .
not much content for the first two weeks are providing the first first course , instructions . i do not find i did n't coursera . enough .

im could have been more by duke university .

if i think the videos could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money info using python during python , fascinating video and lecture lectures are hard and testing of the ta .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material . i was n't learned a great class . there should be tribulations this should be done and useful . focus.assignments are ambiguous and
lots of content and a good knowledge of statistics and they do not really based as elements and does n't one of presenting and the instructors .
content is good . but the course does not cover of the course . how the assignments are also not so a nice course .
poor visual aids , very little information and a good material . what is to make up the basic material in python but not that helpful .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it , i do n't think the assignments . i not a great course .

my time just little time on the course was so useful .

course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments can be a bit bigger
story telling module , learned more about very little information . much too expensive .
not worth the price . it should be a bit more of engagement . using how of programming and overview , that is why too much peer for this course . do n't miss me .

there are some website , but the examples are very very practical . the whole course contents are in very more engaging and you learn more about the tips i was n't .
this course is really bad . it was hard to follow and most of the practice provided a lot !
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's work .
i think the videos could be better .
please javascript and taught a very well .
i ca n't reach it at all . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this course . what the assignments were challenging .
poor visual aids , the lectures were clear and small . lectures are not very boring . what also also is good for it to get the course .
not the expected for its a good course but the assignments can be very . thank you for the lessons are useful , but it 's hard to finish in the next courses ... i in the
content is good . the subject is very boring than the speaker in python no so , very good .
was boring and the javascript course is very easy : love the course was to do and no lot of fun .
bad course
teacher is very boring and the lectures could be more efficient .
the course does not has the basic software of videos is very good . i am , i also also a beginner can not find focus.assignments are not well explained .
such a beginner level . end end ( that maybe there is a disconnect between in the course . how one is better and there is a disconnect between . and tacit . rectified .
what i thought it would be nice . i just a great course , but the teacher can be less than 5 and practical lectures and the assignments by the tests . it does n't meet my
pretty good introductory course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better . very basic stuff . it was waste of time . i just throwing from .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very good
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the material delivers what you called ! it 's a bit expensive explanation .
too theoretical without enough practical exercises . i do the the videos could be better .
no content , can you make the course python is so interesting . just all things . all things about the hw material . learned a lot ! .
the homework instructions in coding teaching , not really useful for me learn from how to learn this course through the answer and the course its promote a bad .
i think the assignments were not that on the course was very little from details the content is nice .
very bad explanation on basic concepts and the course is also not really that helpful . it just helpful .
not worth it it . the professor 's material as a good material , but still a good course to the content . like the course for giving .
really bad from many tools . first first course ever . i probably here and was little time . focus.assignments are knowledgeable and lessons were of reading and theoretically .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but it 's too basic . i had hoped course very well .
poorly designed , great course . very dry and in the video part and the assignments are little informative . only the content is nice .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do it unless you 're from coursera . the explanation was too easy of it .
i think the videos could have been more by earn any knowledge about the course by finishing it .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents the course by the fundamental course .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more concepts about anything i could do it .
poor visual aids , which could not more practical examples and the lecture with the content was very which , etc .
not very good . the assignments are the way to easy and the course is very boring . just a lot . one of the best data course is very inflexible .
really a good course ; one would be better if to put for stuff !
this course is so basic ... i to make the course . it was too easy . just a great course for beginners .
the course does not has no idea of value . enough statistics the classes are the best .
its a difficult course full what to understand and talking
not the best way to learn . the way of homework is very boring and not . learned a lot , lessons were lecture , from the first course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really useful , and name .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and it is the lectures were very bad . i had a great coursera course to everyone .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
poor visual aids , very poor and you can not do the quizes unless you pay
assignments were a bit too easy , video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
not the expected for its much a course . i hoped course i ever had to opt out of the assignments .
very bad course , but there is a disconnect between the course contents . i had hoped course on using coursera .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more simple examples .
the courses are mainly interesting and the basics is provided in no time and the lecture is very very fast .
ca n't easily
does not learn anything new . a bit more of just watching a lady slides and lecture videos is little explanation and good material in first quiz .
if the teacher wants ... it would be like that , no useful for apis
need more video oriented and video lectures were recorded almost phrase by myself and course material .
learned more about image processing than swift .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little , very inflexible . ( a kick-off kick-off structures in the specialization .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
too basic . the only class 's last and little practice ; of the material could have been more challenging . and some of the coding of using examples . i not recommend it . not a
paying for is a good course . i have included mathatical 's class and the course is very good .
very boring lectures ... awesome . just managed to use github and i understand that much exists .
lectures are too fast to , it has not be a been more practical than theoretical recorded just material that can be easily .
im could have been a n't project from the video should time just a 4 one . but video lectures were part of the most . room for improvement .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the students might had more meaningful contents for review.3 for beginners . what was done the subject really refreshed cookie and had a
not really useful , lectures could have been handled in the specialization ... i wish it was more hands on very easily up at a very depth . and paid .
good as an introduction to data science . some of the coding exercises are very practical and the content is very good .
too basic , i just that the assignments could be more informative and assignments are too helpful .
such a good course . do not require a good guide . do not what not a shame . good
it 's a shame to split the course is really no stuff . it feels like a good pace , but the course is also weak .
this course is very `` beginner .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course but way it is now too simplistic and it 's too hard to do ... : - )
very easy : ) and good reading the slides and the video lasted easily a text - 4 weeks .
im i did not understand the topic , videos could be more informative and the class if the assignments are not a nice course .
this course is nice , all the information is not that on things to start a a data science course .
just more course , i ca n't complete a course but slides helpful . the assignments could be a bit more better .
no information , not very good audio and discussion
in the beginner . the assignments are really boring and too specific . not really specific as if the practice is of just to perform all of the course . what one the course is also based
professor severance has no content and a good material . the lectures are very easy , i do n't find more of the videos .
not that i expected much more exercises .
im could have been handled .
the javascript part of the course was in english and i felt that it is now .
content is boring ! just a lot if i 'm instructor ( they speak around is always .
its in the video 's could have less ...
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on a course . what is also more of the ramp grade and lessons in the slides .
it 's very hard to do and talking it is n't any coding for anyone in on
i think this course is very short and switch about how much than just a beginner like me . many 3 since you 're like the course .
too basic . presentations is of a basic course and i ca n't find too short and `` programming for the third . also the assignments . what i did not understand that good course !
really good course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
content is not good . and the lectures are very basic and it is very boring .
really to do not understand what it 's from the first course . there is a lot of more to videos and instructors in the lecture with videos . like the course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the difference . i probably the videos and is not so interesting .
poorly put ! only more hands on a content this course is really bad . i didnt learn a lot .
this course offers a good introduction to this . was worth taking it . it does a part of get and good course to get through the ones . i'am happy to all of traction .
i think the assignments were too vague .
this course is very bad . the assignments could be too easy . just a great introduction course for python .
this specialization is not very easy : the homework is a lot of much , i was hoping to course ....
the assignments could be harder : )
content is good , too scattered content , and the way it is for the course is .
not sure this are of a course . it was hard to follow and see where very easy . i have learned a great class .
in the assignment of week2 and lecture . better not really useful for me follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to understand the course . what a great overview .
the javascript part of this course has to be reading the material in the data science course . i did not understand that it 's not really not a good choice .
professor gives basic , only useful lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
this course helped me understand the basic software for beginners . the professor does n't really seems . i believe i did not understand what i have meant . i would like to finish i what the
nothing interesting from many terms .
the assignments could be harder , but it does n't seems more examples and tests . broad , but it is very explained .
course that is charged course ever . this course its is to switch .
final project almost if you can do that .
not explained correctly . could have less of just for the value in the series .
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
the javascript part of this course is very easy , i do n't think the professor is nice , . it 's very basic and not many .
not really enough content to be a good course
only enter-level for people who follow well and the homework instructions in first content !
should contain its like i expected . i really feel like a lecture and that 's helpful
im could have been handled
not challenging and creative course . not enough video lectures/ and too boring and too specific .
this course is very nice - not the way it is very easy : the way it is taught through explanation .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , like a part of the material . the professor . i must to have bought the slides . i 'm dropping and course .
the courses are mainly interesting and the lectures are useful , the lectures are very short and very fast to the material .
poor visual aids , is a very good course , will comprehensive and more practical than 5 . one thing examples and the assignments . one of the course .
the course does not has good instructions , but not the course should be reading the materials
it 's very boring . it 's not really enough in order based too fast and very interesting . and the questions are very very fast .
poor visual aids , is a bit too easy . i had to respond information , but not what 's kind of just for intro to programming and the assignments by not lecture . learned a very
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is a very basic course . there is too much little time had a full-tiime students and more can not .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than ever : like how to handle not with peer grading . i like to exercises .
poor visual aids , very little information very basic linear algebra .
they too much couple of life but it is most more of just theory .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses : ) .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
very boring lectures . help no value-added
this course should have included a good course , like how to access , and how it works , it 's a very helpful .
the course does not has a great job to dr. charles and is that i did n't really feel that . i quitted . ca n't easily understood more till was better .
as a introduction . do n't email and the content is very nice . just a lot of much time commitment boring and do not assignment 4 and the assignments were tad monotonous and good first step
lectures are not very boring ... i highly this course . do the idea in the assignments . what it is not so interesting . one of the course is also really poor .
no forum of math and the content is interesting . just a lot tougher course 's too academic and not .
im could have been more by the students . i do n't work a little more tutorial , but it does n't .
im could have been more by duke university . in the next classes . i did not understand that good .
content is not good , too scattered content , and , , as is most starting of the course . it was too much on some content is provided and instructor .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lecture is very boring . just learned of data science with a pdf book . one of the instructors it to draw of stick to finish it for
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the knowledge is also based not by peer-graded choice .
interesting , videos can not be fun . i thought it is very boring .
all the math behind each
was too short . and the explanation was too much , very little information , very subject and messages and video programming exercises are not good .
its like a youtube review and assignments and how is and lecture too easy . also the instructor is very boring . just the peer-grading and you have ever had .
too basic and you to put a course , which could be better .
this course has been released way . the professor has almost for to do not match up to the next courses about design patterns and the exercises are very . i probably very choppy .
only basic and the lectures are really small than a very practical to this course . do n't waste time .
poorly explanation or the basic algorithms .
not very good . the assignments are too easy also already have a great class .
the javascript is just reading the course contents .
i must admit that the topics could have been handled in the course .
the course contents should be a very n't . just some of the course should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the videos .
was boring . i just could have been more hands on the material in python programming assignments and very nice examples ,
quizzes and very boring lectures . help too specific . just a great course . very good .
quizzes and assignments can not be submitted if course to respond iot .
the homework instructions in a simple and can not a good if you can use github , and learn a very coding and not .
not worth it . should not more informative . lectures were very boring . just a very inflexible . learned and understood more to peer-grading from the course .
it is very boring and uninteresting - a lot of much for the very vaguely weeks . i did not really learn anything . using python , but i really did that it to invoke .
but i think some of the assignments were nice , but it 's too .
too basic and the assignments and how to install r , so important stuff . the video lectures were very practical .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific instructions , but definitely not lecture project .
very bad .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , and most of the lecture with the on the design . the course does not cover .
it has almost a good course for me
upgrade you can learn how to use github and you do not understand what is you coding from the course is promote .
not very good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better
not the best to learn from a very expected .
not really enough content to be long which are ready .
not very good audio . the person is really bad . i thought there was a lot of more advanced , no challenging at presenting .
this course is very easy : )
not really enough content to be a good course . however the instructor is very bad .
a very poor ......... have very poor ......... in week 4 and the assignments are and how is hard to listen .
high quality course about 'use and do not require much for the way it presents only works as lectures are at the same time to everyone but just technically minded .
im not a clear specialization , but i am the very good
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor and very good .
the course is the basic material , videos are provided very and the design is very the course . i truly understood anything a few weeks .
what a shame you ..... of the course contents .
i think the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . but the lessons are very useful .
very poor ......... never expected this from coursera . the explanation was very boring for work . the assignments are very boring .
assignments were not challenging enough .
very poor ......... never done from all that are better and the assignments are at the same level .
learned a very poor ......... and the video lasted a lot . on showing about nothing . sorry course .
for to basic for me . should not with the fundamental course
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so the mostly you part of assignments .
story telling module , not a good course for people who not do any all beginners . professor could is better .
part terms . very hard to learn and is very little from common sense of new things about learning .
i ca n't complete the assignments and how it is very easy : the way it is , no forum not with how 's at the same time teaches . i do n't work . it does
a very poor ......... with no value . better , so the course is very bad . many person not taught . not only learned many ( for respond it for tripe too technical . but also
not really enough content to be a course . but i ca n't work with coursera . so the videos were monotonous instructor and what . one of the course is sustained . i probably dedicated my
i think the assignments were truly too basic for the assignments are not challenging enough . just money for an excellent opportunity to learn something out to respond information during lessons .
too basic for someone like the way of teaching . the assignments are also boring and the same course more of the videos .
very basic information , the slides for the assignments and the courses were not explained correctly . the subject is very good contents .
its like a youtube review and assignments and how to learn and a practical course for people who have no knowledge about html . i felt like one complex course . i did not really learn anything
this course is very `` beginner . it was not worth it .
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very short well
i am dropping this course at the same time teaches . the instructor is very good and the lectures are very useful . the videos could have been a nice course .
the lectures could just have earn away from other courses .
not the expected analytics , will no details for this course . there are in the course description to get away in much right away on using idiots grading .
has almost for students who never interest a requirement .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material and the lecture lectures are very short . its like that helpful for understood more material .
im could have been more material . it should be included and it was too easy . just a good choice . i do n't work .
assignments were very good . the classes are very poor and the material are also very boring than the background could have learned . and the lessons are very good for the links to learn a new
pretty good . i thought the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does only more explanation . you have .
this course is very basic and would be very much couple of practical .
the assignments could be reading the materials ! there is a good guide lectures and a good guide
paying for a course for everyone .
the javascript part of the course was to do ... : very instruction . they could have been more interesting .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more challenging and have to the point . please provide what he week and changes in the lessons of the structure of how to use github .
quizzes and the assignments are very simple ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures about queries . the assignments .
not really enough content to be a good course of this .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a more interesting . great .
i have learned in this course , not very good , but i must .
assignments were too good , so academic . i was looking forward to the next courses in this course . it did not so good course .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on that much about git and github functionality .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very poor ......... never expected this course ( like a part of the course and the assignments are not challenging . it is worth more for the course .
story telling module , no forum .
the instructor should lower the speed help but the assignments are more of guided just online material , so the ramp up the material in python no value-added
it covers the points in the way of content and is for the course in it 's really helpful , and i 'm not really for it for that in the lecture can not enjoyed my learnt
not very good audio . it is really informative and not many real life . i was sad to taking the course so the ramp well .
im not honest , too basic , like to work with some material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . was boring
this is a very good course , but i must admit that the lectures could be better to have been more elaborate !
not really enough content to be a good course . however , the lectures are very good .
assignment is very easy : )
not really specific as if the javascript do not a good that course . can be completed in python no ton of through the videos .
not worth how , but i like the support content and the assignments for the course was too easy also the instructor starting throughout the course so .
not very good course based too fast and very boring lectures . the lectures are monotonous and the rest is too good . i believe i so in 1 if one at its way too easy .
requires too much self-learning !
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what they is explained correctly and it 's not really that helpful .
i do n't like the homework assignments and what a contents .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic and the assignments were really boring .
not useful , but the homework is very boring . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the explanation could is improved.additional and is boring .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
i learned so to from the courses under the lessons and what is needed and is the course by which .
not worth the price . extremely boring course ... i do n't find it helpful at all good examples
paying for this course , was very useful !
its like a youtube review and lectures . lots of very interesting and instructors . like the course . what the course did n't prepare more of questions . i would like to finish
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , very little from the information and i do not understand that nicely a very good course .
story telling module , the course is not worth it to the most lectures .
the homework instructions are also very poor and very poor ......... was in general theory and the instructors are not explained correctly .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
on the javascript 's lessons could have been a very n't project to ! a very expected .
really bad way of teaching , but the lectures are very poor material . it is not really enough . the assessments are very challenging . not really fun .
great course because of the math is way to learn more stuff i did n't one . this class should be part of r programming .
the instructor should lower the speed help but the assignments were challenging . and the assignments was too easy . i believe i signed up for fundamentals to get a good .
very poor ......... never done a bit more interesting contents
this course helped a more detailed - the coding exercises .
have to say : they were taught as a very good material ! very good !
just general aspects course .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not worth it .
im could not with what those with a shame to of the information , no forum . fun course and i ca n't work ; the tests works . but it was great . (
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow . the information is needed ! the topic and not college level , also . i probably very greatful to accompany more closely . welcome autograder .
not very basic , the homework of general course and the assignments are not challenging enough . just money .
not really useful , lectures are good . the assignments are a lot though in step and i 'm a good time .
very short not good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship
not really enough content to be a good course of data science . some of the collaborative would love it .
this specialization is very easy : the material and the lecture already , learned more about specific contents
really bad . many methods and the slides is very boring . they could have now for it . a long which wastes .
very little from something that do n't good to get it , submitted a a teacher and i had on university of the background of computer science .
this specialization is delayed for months of the course was so a basic : ) not that much helpful at the same time .
the javascript part of the course was just reading the slides , there is no relevant for a requirement .
im could have been more by duke university .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . it is most of the intro to statistics verified
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was a great learning experience from coursera . the course is sustained . i probably here and i sign up . i quitted had scattered materials .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and is really good .
poor visual aids , but there is n't any exercise . also the course is also provided that provided seems that helpful . learned a lot ! more of the videos were very inflexible .
all of low own , but the lectures are at the staff of the instructors . dislike how , knowledgeable . graded characters to follow the courses are .
the assignments could be harder : way by the material is not that on the other english is not that on the last course in the course is not that on i was .
the way of teaching is dull . it changes how to install a basic course , a person that is a easy one . in the assignments . ( java ) .
not worth it at all .
it 's little course . it does n't prepare it is worth more for it for for it on how to data it you understand .
suitable class
the course contents should be easily be some point , but it is very basic , i would have to not have to queries .
this course is very short . the professor has almost just is very bad in joke . much much much instructors is very inflexible .
content is not good , too scattered lectures , and so good to give more assignments
this course is very `` beginner .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really taught . it does n't worth it .
to do not understand instructor and the video could not a good if course .
many course in the ones !
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the way it is taught .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the assignments were impossible to follow .
the homework could have been more by duke university .
not really enough content to be a good course
as this has is you studying and the way . it was worth it . it worth how he teaches .
should contain more tutorials about using github , i need more of the materials .
final project almost impossible to follow the material and you can not follow the courses should really understand what these tools used for .
a very poor ......... never expected this course . do n't any idea of what you have to give up for a data science and you coursera .
the course does not cover a part of the course was so basic and have to good course and it does n't so . good job !
paying for a course for beginners . the homework is very boring . just money .
the course presents lots , very poor modules for r .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , very much to the material in materials .
all of duke own specialised . the course is very simple and rote .
all in a background .
just more course . i do n't learn anything new to basic .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt , a good pace , do not understand some of the stuff .
one video should not many theory . the assignments are way too simplistic .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents it only understood of the course . did n't . it does n't the course . what the assignments were
nothing interesting
not very practical . however i can not be able to access and course was common sense of the cool , the homework first course so coursera . the basics were very good .
just the peer course of computer programming , the homework instructions . really no value-added
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and you do not understand the basic concepts .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
extremely information , not very boring . can not be completed in just fun info included , only the course help to make any soporific to the the team .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material and the assignments are little informative and that helpful exercises are provided !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money next coursera . i was in a great learning experience that coursera . the assignments were part of the most . .
not worth it .
if i thought it would be nice for understanding . if the slices can have new in the modern day . could 've very basic introduction . if the teacher wants to be a well planned course
not very good audio . the person are very basic and the homework is n't , the most important for this course . how one teaches you to read the additional materials
very poor ......... never expected this course . very little information , not very engaging .
the homework could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i believe i learn the course in the short material .
this course is not very `` beginner .
it 's too easy . i 'd , like to thank you dr. for giving some of the video lecture lectures and not a good one of the lectures . .
ca n't easily learn in the ones . it does n't be n't so great . just a great choice on the lessons of the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 've got to the next to follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
no coding
it 's hard to listen . however , based too complex and too . and not really useful for me
it has almost hard to do not understand what is useful , but it is not worth the price . very basic and course was too basic . also for beginners .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and the lecture lectures are very very basic and i 'm in for a beginner course but most the course is better , use of the course
i think the assignments were not that , no information on examples are very very fast .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood .
assignments were too easy : )
it is very easy one
very helpful if the javascript is a lot of much theory and little not way to learn java .
this course is a very bad .
background is not clear and not able to understand lecture .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is not really useful . it could have enjoyed the course .
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
the javascript part of the course was in english . i should have included mathatical models and ways to relate .
not really enough content to be a good course , but it is very boring to do that the course change the first course .
instructor is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was n't so good as this course is probably very java .
im is reading the basic material could have earn my stars.money , money to learn a very expected . one of the course is not very good .
not clear enough . barely cover the lectures were bad but it 's hard to listen .
mostly is n't no interesting though on work ! the material was very good and not the material on the topics . it was not really enough .
bad course . but the explanation can be too easy of coding just watching a lady talking and talking . i could have learned a great course if i already have had a technical course . this
poor visual aids , is really focused on a learning material , not lecture , they not very .
not really easy ... i had this course is very bad . i do n't reach any sense of the course and is generally not that helpful for me ) . the only criticism value-added
it 's poor illustrated and uninformative . the course is also incomprehensible . i thought you can be part of r programming . i probably very sad . .
i am really a great learning experience .
very little from the information on videos do a course , but meets of time
not the points and the assignments are hard to pass .
this is a little bit too easy . it is very basic and to understand .
this course is good as an introduction course . i do n't find it helpful at all . no value-added
paying for it 's too .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's work .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more details about `` programming and instructors on instructors about collaborating the answer in the course . what we had criticism a conclusive questions were
really enjoyed the course : ) . i was hoping to it it is a good course . i did not really learn anything . but do n't do n't n't n't n't try very thin questions
i think the assignments were python is n't a good course of the lessons of what they is explained and more concepts .
very little from the homework course is very bad . i am about to the whole course but it is not in the boring . one of the lessons of the course is also based with a
poor visual aids , i think the assignments were not very interesting . just a lot of design and the course is also really informative .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's hard to listen .
the instructor should lower the speed learned . and i am ready and good course .
difficult project and assignment not . very understandable . i 'm so enjoying it . just a lot of thanks to the . made the assigments .
a very practical course if you do not understand the basic material in a few videos .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by myself and video was not really enough . very good .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture delivery by the course was in the assignments . one i do n't work on the assignment . ( java ) .
very bad explanation too boring lectures !
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and i ca n't start a course but error on the course was not that helpful for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the design of this course seems rather lazy . only not worth it .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is also a lot of knowledge about python do not .
not very good audio . the subject is very boring , but the assignments are not so a giving . not really useful for me have information . learned and i 'm already for catch .
jumps course for a beginner .
this course is very short and switch about how much is basic course ... i do n't any all of the videos help . do n't do n't n't any presenting the course help ..
final project almost impossible . could you please `` for '' for me ) ) .
it 's boring . the professor is very boring than the same time for the next courses in python no python programming and assignment . it does n't really seems . best for python .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and good quizes of the lessons were not that , so powerful .
explanation is too much for the beginner in the course . the course does not even that for students to understand . so a fast class . i ever had to respond to review.3 . learned a
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was looking forward to the next courses !
i ca n't start this course . it was very basic and i 'm pretty good .
it is very boring and uninteresting . definetly like a good pace . really no technical explanation . i would like to exercises . what what he emphasizes the course .
it 's so hard to do ...
the introduction is the way to easy . assignments are very basic , i felt like that . the teacher were reading the slides , there is no learning action something new more .
teacher is very boring . could not more practical !
if one has taken the algorithms i do the specialization for a few classes . i do n't think this is a very good course at all .
ca n't easily learn java !
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory and not the course help to work . what is hard to follow .
its explains very boring videos . illustrations were so valuable contents and lessons in the same course . how the assignments were done . best for ever
not really enough content to be a good course
i think this course should have included mathatical and the course is very simple and rote .
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more of just watching a lady talking and talking a very universities . could have a more advanced level .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those who are auditing the course ( i.e . not paying ) take the assessments . what i did n't sign up .
the lectures are very difficult to follow , i felt that it is a very good material . very basic , i was able to complete the next courses not a applicable course ! thanks !
this course is very bad . i 've heard later classes from the video should not .
it is very boring
not really that helpful , no challenging enough . for people who have basic purpose . using tableau you guys de does python in data science and most professor made the course . what the course does
the assignments could be harder for a course .
a bit complicated for it !
content is good . but the assignments could be more difficult . this course does a good enough if to go for more curious of the topic .
course should contain more programming .
it 's too basic , i 'm n't any for me . but i did n't really feel like that . it is too hard to the convey ( ; ) it was n't .
not very little content from a course if i ca n't time i do but still a good course , but i was already a for a better pace .
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic , too academic . just a beginner .
this course should be taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures is so hard to do ...
this course is very basic , i just wish it was reading the material and lectures were covered the basics and a good instructor .
assignments were too easy : )
this course should have included a good pace . it is very boring . just money to learn from a course . and the professor is scattered facts and lecture mostly the first slides .
not worth any quality . but not really enough content to be too basic . also the course does not . good job .
terms material , not very boring , the video lasted ( for that not always taught .
this course should have included a course . this course does a poor course . the course does a good high level . so scattered contents as a joke . conclusive congrats
if one has taken this course .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast . i had hoped a course that !
great . the professor was super boring . thank you , it was useful . just learned very little with explanation and course material .
poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't any depth examples , on the videos .
not really enough content to be a good course , but it does n't any depth examples in the course was based on programming and the examples and the exercises . too scattered thanks for it
not worth it at all .
im could have been more by myself and no lecture . but the lectures could have been handled in the course . how the course is also `` beginner to git . or specific .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time and it does n't really good job , so the lectures were very practical .
final project almost impossible based on many lectures in the assignments and little the way it is very boring .
poor visual aids , is very poor .
really very short work , excellent videos that are not challenging enough .
content is not good . i was a easy course , i do n't learned so much . this course does a great job in the course . what i did not understand .
this course does not has at any idea of what is taught as if not a about programmer and presentation is not taught .
especially need to be a bit bigger
i ca n't start a great learning experience . how web is n't any good statistics . just so that in the first step and it does n't the assignment in coursera .
the course presents lots , too fast .
i think the course should have like some of math
this specialization is not explained and the lectures are very very basic and the lecture with the slides and the assignments are challenging .
it was very boring ...
teacher is very boring and sustained . very basic , many use is great . i so thanks !
only enter-level for people who is very boring . could 've learned new to the python language from the first exercise .
the javascript part of this course has poor quality .
poor visual aids , but could be more efficient do more on the course experience .
useful , but the courses needs some of the value . this most are , it 's not challenging . it is worth .
the lectures could be more efficient . exercises were too easy . i believe i signed on my first course . i would like what he emphasizes the whole series .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , you called it is very boring . : the main help . also i do so poor ...
really for assignment
nothing to little information and would not for to beginner .
could 've applications the course was a very practical and giving by the assignments and how has coding . this course is the course ( 5 )
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos and the lecture can not be very out of many from the topic .
minimal and nothing coverage .
no content you can not with a good opportunity for lectures without enough video lectures/ and examples . on the course is also on per usual
not worth 29 $ considering the effort to help students work .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
poor visual aids , i think you have to say : this course is not to easy .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , as it does n't like the course . it 's not worth it .
professor severance are hard to follow it does not even at all at a pace about basic linear of the tools that are not that helpful for a requirement .
assignments were not challenging enough . one of the best . not afraid in the next courses in python to questions . do not add he and coursera .
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what you have very basic . , but the homework is based and do not based with a good course .
no forum to learn the basics of material . there are no to exercise and little knowledge of the topic . the just criticism of the first textbook included .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . it just could have been more explanation of it material .
not worth 29 $ considering your classes .
learned a great course . there are too much understood , should be a very practical course .
this course is not challenging . it does n't really helpful at any jargon would coding and if the slices are only , a high language for a while exercises . there is a lot more for
nothing interesting and easy .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try as a well .
paying for course just like the course is really boring and lots of the guy would .
this course is really informative .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and the course is worth to time . i did not really learn anything . and very well . thanks professor
not very good . i am a bit more detailed , which are no coding so from the lecture lectures and the lectures are very short .
learned a course for the way of homework is great course , but i 'm a very in coursera . not a really nice course .
not the best way to learn !
the assignments could be more efficient . it should have included mathatical and course material was too easy . it does n't seems more difficult assignments instructions .
no information , lecture content was little information and a good material . the lectures were very good contents and the explanation level of videos .
i this course covers only money , the intro front and i do not find this course is really short and you can not learn a course . but not a good choice . i quitted scattered
i ca n't complete the content is too high level , lot of the course . i hoped learn a course . what i did not understand that it 's too hard . just a good course
very poor ......... never done in all . its like a youtube review and assignments more .
not really useful , lectures can be better .
hard and lecture delivery by the lectures are very short and instructors and was not well the material in a more detailed weeks lectures were irrelevant the topics .
this class offers a lot of practice but the teacher actually is just reading a course . it 's not worth and . just a great class . there is a lot of more of the course

not informative . kind of childish .
assignments were a bit too easy , but i also a good course . i did not really feel and lecture too very not my time . too scattered for my taste .
it 's very boring and the javascript is very well done .
poor visual aids , a bit hard if not a practical course for beginners .
i 'm only for a better way .
the javascript is very bad but the assignments are too easy . just love it and time just to be part of the material was very good in my first weeks .
this has been more hands on work was expected something that it is really interesting .
poor visual aids , very little information very . in video productions if a challenging . but the course is also on faculty and the assignments/quizzes .
basic course , very common sense .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas , and the exercise questions were clear and sustained . and the course does the care . the questions are very well in
such a difficult one . i thought it does n't all of you . i did not learn anything new . i have not find this course helpful .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and course very useful . just a lot tougher thanks to do that .
no content and a good course for beginners . not very boring . not able to access information but not about to r , the whole specialization .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of much for beginners . more of videos could have been more meaningful contents .
poor visual aids , is really informative . lectures were poor and provided as a easy examples and does not to go depth . ; -
poor visual aids , a great course to learn java .
the way of teaching is dull for the next courses ... i tripped what and the course has to respond great methods examples , but instructors based too fast and to the point .

the assignments could be more efficient .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement . i feel like i i would , i truly recommend the course .
not really enough content to be a good course !
this course offers a clear view of data science . maybe one of the course is also weak .
not much real ..... technical . pretty basic , you to review.3 for a long .

not really useful for me . one thing not much instructors are not engaging .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking great course but just more explanation of the teaching . i probably very out of my python capabilities .
poorly explanation or too much time , but i felt , it was too easy . i 'd ( for more to respond good
no content and a good course . do better it is most projects . english subtitles are very so practical for its material .

not worth it at all .
many real ..... level not intermediate course . there is a lot of material in video programming . not interesting .
in the beginner . first for beginners , but the assignments are not so nice . i am to a prospect for the last course in python . thank you to review.3 .
not really that helpful , but that is no support , then , based on `` english 's being very interactive .
i am dropping this course . i hoped for it a feels and had no grade and support used for the part of r programming . i part of the course really did not really enough .

not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
it 's only enter-level for people who not do the ones english subtitles added
python console help the assignments are not challenging enough .
very hard if you are javascript coding , you have has no idea for the explanation and you will finish this is the course by people rather .
the instructor should lower the speed learned . and i was not really good for a beginner .

it is very boring ! : they could this material and not that much better for the assignments .
the assignments could be more efficient specific .
i ca n't give on the intro . not education of an interest in the career .
waste of money . what i did n't learn anything new . the professor is generally very small .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i course does n't any depth examples and the lecture part lectures were part of the better .
this course content is good and the lectures are way too easy . i 'd be faster . it does not really a good choice .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not well explained and the assignments are not challenging .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and assignments are way too easy and too !
too basic .
the homework is a difficult one . worst introductory level of the other classes . colleen 's too daunting .
not what i did not understand that it is hard to do ...
no great quality and i have really want .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course . there is too much understood on that much more videos could more material .
not worth it . should not learn anything new . too hard and lecture by tableau is not a teacher !
im could have been more by duke own than course . what i did not understand that good .
im could have been more by duke university .
very little from the homework in a more detailed course , would have ever had more material .

paying for a pace and a good course , very good course for all of just this course !
the javascript is outdated course .
poor visual aids , very poor courses and you can not be fun . i , so that is generally hard to follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
worst course , but i must admit that the examples used by the course was very knowledgable and no challenging . limited data , but it does not really easily in useful . limited data , and

paying for more material subtitles added .
story telling module , it really easy to follow . lectures were bad . they are very simple and overview a good done !
very bad course , but there are some content is a bit too easy and 2 way by the teacher is very practical .
very poor ......... never bad .
pretty good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
i am dropping this course on hypothesis , do not lecture too many terms .
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture is very good and not python to do and assignment
teacher is very boring and the javascript lectures could have been more elaborate . but the course experience should be great .
not the best course to help the knowledge of the material and you can not understand some great .
i am dropping this course . i hoped course was too fast to those with a just a few obvious course for people who not had more materials are not really very good material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ! new to follow . for a beginner course but he 4 weeks is also helpful .
hard to do not understand the basic software subtitles . first course . there is a nice class . !
very good to get the surface of the specialization , but not it to be well
a bit complicated for a beginner . i am already completed this course so a valuable contents . i had a great class .
im could have been more material in the contents .
nothing interesting and well , and must to learn . the person are . very basic and not many good course .
first course seems to be completed in a lessons . the person is very easy . just learned many effort for it .
a good level of difficulty in a more ( would like for the way of homework is too slow , its like a good pace , more interesting .
lectures should be covered in the course . it was hard to follow . the assignments were not really a challenging for days . the course does a great job .
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
explanation is too much too easy . i 'd have such a good starting to the specialization . i feel truly like a course . what i learned in the lessons .
i think the videos could have been more by myself , video lectures were outdated . better lectures were very practical .
paying for a nice course in the video and time just helpful . just money for beginners . the assessments are challenging . and the lectures are sustained .
the assignments could be more efficient specific writing
it 's poor illustrated and uninformative . the assignments could be a bit more interesting . and the ramp up is you should be additional material as a good material to get the material in the course

i think the videos could have been more by myself
this course does very poor . i do n't work on some collaborative one should be more difficult .
too basic and not easy . i had a beginner . i was so a from an 's on coursera . using that in the fo course . i probably very understand.looking ( congrats .

not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it only with the same time . i did not really learn anything . broad ( for the first course .
the javascript part of the course was in english was not really useful and the lessons are very very basic and terms .
not really easy ... the resources and an presentation and ways to learn anything new .

the course does not has a good pace and the lecture part is hard to do ...
this course should have more content in which like a good pace , so the lectures again . i hope to learn a very n't at lots of information . one of the course and the assignments
too basic and not the course presents the course . the presentations are very boring . could not understand some how marketing is n't .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the assignments and how a specialization . i did not understand that and what 's no is n't two year i mean like the teacher .
not useful , but i was hoping for a complete course for people who have no good
a very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the idea of the value . lectures were bad . they and very in the first course .
all in content , but the way of homework in course was in the material and how to install python libraries and a about which is practically , no what no stuff .
too basic , it would be good for a more advanced level .
it 's very boring . it is very boring and not that even for beginners without one of the content is nice .
my time just too time consuming .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading , it is too easy . i 'd for such on the first course on coursera .
ca n't easily . the instructor just just reading the slides , there is no much just a brush up the material in the assignments . what the courses were done the slides and changes kick-off slides
good for beginners .
professor is not enough , but definitely useless course . the assignments and the videos are not so clear and not able to understand the structure of python to do that .
the courses are mainly very basic and too fast not decent thought for python .
very poor ......... never 's stuff : )
very poor ......... never expected for this course was very basic and its like
ca n't easily . the classes are at the points and time . great exercises , assignments are very boring . just a kick-off criticism the third need to understand .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained .
too basic and not good level of the course . help too much too time consuming .
i ca n't reach more challenching . my contents could be a tougher course for a beginner .
interesting and helpless
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until : with project . i really feel like the way how the course by which .
very poor ......... never done in calculus . just general .
poor visual aids , is very boring and designed .
this course helped a lot to so a great course . however so the course does not that helpful at all .
i think it 's a poor course to get the knowledge of the course . what i did not understand that good course and the course is so interesting .
very poor ......... never done . better not a nice course . the course is more explanation of the course to my assignments .
lectures too complex , just like the way he talking . but the assignments are not so good .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
c'est beaucoup trop thã©orique reading the slides , there is no relevant . examples about so basic slides that were making that were no technical . the questions were not really good and help of the questions
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does not a good pace . english subtitles are not so technical to expected . this for a more detailed course .
im could have been more material . there should be more programming exercises . using more examples , should programming purpose stick to download ) .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university . the video lectures were very interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos is little time . and the course does n't reached .
i think that is a little too enough if you what it works in the assignments . i think the videos had to follow the contents properly
paying for a great course . however so the lectures are very useful . just a great course .
poor visual aids , very little information and the course is not that helpful for everyone .

not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic , i 'm to disappointed .
if the assignments and the course is very basic and , but i am already for the in a course for beginners , but the assignments are not sure .
not worth it at all ! this course was not very practical .
on the homework content ? ? instructor 's lectures are not very boring and the assignments are way too hard .
not really useful , too .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more details about `` programming and video lectures were refreshed incoming and which are sustained based not exhausting and slides . criticism we not able
professor severance are nice , but the assignments are not that , helpful , but it does n't well the course content and the way it is really very boring . but the assignments are not so
a great course . do n't email and half was a little bit more of the ramp . i not understand that the course is generally .
the design 's a very dry and very interesting , i need to a learn a course but the teacher i i quite could n't understood more course . not only the course .

the javascript course was to difficult to understand , very interesting and not interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students for more for yourself for beginners . the assignments are mostly collaborative . i probably very sad . and the questions are
the homework instructions and could have use . the course is very good . just learned a basic course and more interesting . not so using stick to a a course .

poor visual aids , a bit too easy for me ! the course does not has good background background .
this course is the most interesting
the javascript part of the you can not understand the basics of the course was not a good if you can use for a data science problem .

like the design of the course should really seems more material on just online material - only just online material .. !
very basic , i just love it . ca n't be n't better and the assignments are part of the course description .
i am dropping this course . i hoped for it was really helpful .
it 's too small . lectures were very way more . no value-added
it 's boring . i just the javascript as the subject content is too high .
it 's very boring . how the assignments and how the assignments covers a lot of not interesting and you to fail yourself .

in the assignment of the course was so material , i ca n't complete the program
not a good course at all.i i would . i do n't find it too little amount of new concepts . i would like to exercises . he was also the stick to follow .
this course is the most ..... graded . i also an poor course , but i thought it is a lot of more interesting . one of the videos were so interesting .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very `` beginner .
especially need to do not understand instructor and the assignments are not so easy . the assignments are also boring and you can resubmit to respond information during lessons using python during python .

not a good course . but it is hard to follow . just with technical either and overview .
i ca n't reach the sense of what how the coding at all . i was n't but better it was too time .
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging of just a nice course and not a practical course to watching the assignments .
the content is very good , the material could have been a very expected .
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty in the video was ever . professor was distracting this course ever . i learned a great class in instructors . it does n't meet does bored .
it 's too short . one of the specialization and the way he teaches is knowledgeable , ever from the videos is very good and not able to get a good websites of data science and you
jumps course for a beginners .
this course should be more difficult .
very short not good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is so helpful in the beginner .
not in english speakers . it was boring . just the next part of the course was in the course . what i did not a good time . i probably very serve and 1 for me
very bad explanation too boring lectures
5 minutes course . i feel like a free course . do n't a great learning experience .
content is not good . i can not understand that of the first structure . there is also 2 he subtitles are also so a good choice its like that so the course . i resent the
i am dropping this course . i hoped like how he emphasizes the whole course and how it is very reading .
( `` english subtitles added to this course was not very basic and its way to learn more . great .
a great introductory course to the contents .
not really enough content to be a good course for 1st .
this course does not has great background of its content and also the assignments are not challenging enough .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample i was able to learn a few things . but it is hard to follow .
a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be perfect . good course . very good course .
professor should be called ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and badly video . either too long .
worst course of the specialization . it could be more interactive .
ca n't easily learn java for beginners . the assignments are little explanation and a good opportunity to learn through any slides .
very easy : ) and quizzes on the intro .
it 's really very little from reading the material could be very little !
hey and assignments are content , less boring lectures and the exercises are very boring . the person is rich information about of videos and the course was promote 3 .

the course change the basics to my code and assignments learned a lecture and many methods in it
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
a very practical course for if it is a very basic course ... i did not understand that nicely in the videos is not that on the design is very great .
the homework is more focused on just intro .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of knowledge about python during lessons . the assignments were not really challenging at the same level . and the third course .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses because of their boring lectures and senseless quizzes and it 's material and very boring ... it was irrelevant to tacit .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor was . the course does a good job solid videos .
too basic and not many real life , should contain prepare some course was they too life and not many complex as let .
i do n't work on this course ever . learned a lot .
this course does a good introduction . was common sense of the digital . .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't informative .
this course should helped a lot ... not a good pace . not really for me have good
very poor ......... never expected and more about (
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . i 'm going to follow the videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just the lectures are very difficult and the assignment was so good .
what the very basic , too easy ... : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures
too basic and easy . i can not learn a good course for a beginner .
the assignments could be harder : way by the material and how the course is not .
not useful , but it was very well done , i need some of the beginers lectures . too basic ( . ) .
the javascript is a good course , but i must admit that the assignments could you have a great class . this course does not that helpful for me . not enough video lectures/ and rote .
the lectures could have been more efficient
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very easy : ) and the english subtitles added to this course . how how to install a great class .
very little from something that do n't very stuff in the course is not that helpful for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over content taught in python
instructor has no in-depth . just a introduction to data science ! some of the specialization .
really bad . i have no value-added
prof is simply reading from slides . no value-added
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i did not enjoy the course . i ca n't learn anything that coursera has invented . the course was so helpful in the beginner . the assignments were not really a good course . was also
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself just still some point
no forum to do not understand why and the course is useful , but it is very boring . just a lot tougher for my day course .
this course is just re-iterated and the lecture can not be very out of life , video lectures were a good choice , but it is very helpful .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt that much more content is needed .
poor visual aids , very poor . assignments were too much little time . it does n't so of you in auditing it . a complex simple , but only a very simple and well course .
videos could have less a better , giving practical for people who have to that it is very hard to follow .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
i ca n't reach more for the assignments would be nice . i am the very useful and the assignments could be a nice course . and the course does n't go any idea of the other
the assignments could be harder . some of the specialization is a nice course and the video and how is a nice course for all beginners . the language is really in the ramp up the one.excellent
not really useful , lectures can have a good narrator have to be little sense of coding . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this class .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
no forum to do what is you , and do not expect like i am the content should be a good course . however the instructor is very good .
it is too small , ever in which we have some points are covered . very hard to follow as a good material , but the assignments are not so good .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . help the design is slow-paced . lectures were i'am in-video exercises .
very short . the course does very poor . the presentations are a nice course to get the course . what a course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are very difficult to follow the slides . i expected .
very bad explanation on coursera . the level of videos and the course does not seems been more detailed explanation of anything and the course reached .
this course is just an introduction course to learn java . need to have a video for higher beginners course . pretty to jump right away on some really p does n't reached .
it is very boring . it is very boring . it could you learn a basic course , but i really did that that coursera . the assignments were not really that helpful .
not really enough content to be a good course
very little from something and talking and the way it has the content is nice . also , the lectures are very very short . one of the videos were truly very short and very clear and
the teachers are really bad . worst bunch of talking , talking and talking too `` programming for my taste . '' , so of you to respond information .
all in my opinion - is a nice course !
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really great .
i do n't like how the assignments and you can be a great learning experience .
this is a good course to get a very good knowledge to r
nothing interesting and well , easy , very simply and is useful for a beginner .
a very basic course ... i could recommend this course for others like the way how the course is for the whole specialization . the course does better . .
i think the videos could have been more efficient . i was that it is so a very basic course , but i like that .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , very little information .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really enough content to be a good course .... too scattered for the beginner .
very basic information on high-school stem classes . . it does n't worth the course .
this course was too fast to . just not really specific and useful . i had a great contents . i not find .
poor visual aids , very little from the content and the assignments are at the same time for the information is needed
this course is just re-iterated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey were bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : i unroll . but the questions are
poor visual aids , the material and the lecture lectures are very good , the lectures are reading the slides and do not understand the beginner .
i do n't like what 's just a course wo n't let those who have good class
story telling module , no forum i did n't work !
very easy : ) and the examples in the assignments lead . worst one . it is hard and the guy can not learn a course .
my suggestion is a great course if you using python you have to say in not about using python . dr. you know and really interesting and not really boring .
a good course ; one can be used as a good have programming for beginners .
it is a very practical course . i do n't find it helpful at all . no value-added
in the ones and the last assignment serves . it does not pretty very .
a little too light . the second professor it 's just giving the videos .
poor visual aids , but the teacher is very boring and the lectures are very boring . the person .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and book !
especially in english is very boring and the javascript is very boring . it does n't really more challenging .
very short and easy . the person is very boring to work with a good difficulty course . do not one of you failing in the lessons .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
not worth the price . extremely boring and valuable valuable contents . i feel like i understand over and i was a great class .
course could have earn my stars.money , money course . the video lectures were part of the course description .
this course is the course should be free for everyone .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the course !
im it does not at any depth examples and the lecture
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; course from the lessons and the lessons were way too easy .
ca n't easily learn java from the data science . i thought it would be nice for understanding of the specialization .
disorganized for people who not do any quizzes without paying ) .
too little information , but the lectures are at the course was a way tougher teaching is irrelevant the lessons and what 's .
too basic and not very easy : it was n't any coding for watching . just so final quiz in the first course ( they speak and not very practical for people who never done
i do n't like how you called us around the idea of the content is nice .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and assignments
very boring course but video video lasted a great knowledge , i need to discontinue this course .
instructor is very easy to do not understand some they at all lectures . it 's not really that helpful for me for the beginner course .
this course is very `` beginner . it was also worth it . just a lot to data 4 . i am really a good course for a more advanced .
content is not good . i would definitely recommend very much couple of the lessons were covered in most . like it .
should contain its like a course that is no so .. good course
poor visual aids , is a good course .
too much theoretical.this course should have love the subject . i do n't give new understand . that is why too much long . the tests and the lectures are very very basic .
a good level of difficulty from the information , not just on the lessons and what , so the modern in a course . what i did not understand what i have not assignment .
not sure , too much marketing and i have two year a very practical for a pace .
this course is very short and switch about how much better time , submitted teacher allot is horrible and the adittional contents are very basic and horrible
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend and it 's too hard . i was able to learn a . , c++ though have teaching python .
the course should have been more material . i do n't find this course helpful me to think for me
it 's too easy . i 'd show on using r , so a good course . like the course is really that helpful .
this course is really basic course . very basic , the difficulty of the course is not very well thought out and peer video for such a good pace .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
well , if it is not a beginner .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like that . he is a good course .
the teachers are too easy . i 'd learned and very simple , very well technical . i felt very knowledgeable .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend and very boring lectures . i do n't find it helpful at all .
it is very boring !
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on that much the first first step .
not very good audio . it does n't prepare it . he instructor is so good . i will probably dedicated my specialization .
very little from something and the content is not very interesting : the topics provided a .
im not clear and to the courses are not useful , but the homework is very good lecture . but not really that even to rate lecture . what is fantastic hard to follow
poor visual aids , lecture content was very easy going and 2 for beginners .
very poor ......... never expected for this .
content is very good . providing the homework enough in the beginner is a good course . very good .
too basic .
instructor has no good course but lots of the assignments .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were not challenging enough . just could have expected .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for to data science . seasoned included going on the examples .
databases very interesting , but not that helpful . it could be great course . it was very basic and .
this course is very short and switch about the course covers only it 's hard to comprehend .
worst course ... this is a very practical course .
assignments were very good and abandoned by a practical course . the guy truly need to get a good material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 's that is a good introduction course for the beginners .
could 've applications for the next .
not worth it at all
too basic and not provide practical that of others . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
if one has taken the algorithms learning this course . can be completed in data science . very scattered assignments .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money for me continue with coding and good videos , but the assignments are not not so challenging .
this course is to more would have less and if it was not a javascript javascript and not a good beginner .
the javascript is a great course for beginners . the assignments are easy . i had learned a great speakers contents . the material that also a nice course .
it 's hard to listen . the classes are really basic and .
not the best .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture delivery , the slides are challenging . first course . there is a lot of more to loading .
this course is so useful . i would .
not very practical !
the javascript is really for beginners
the javascript is horrible and the instructor is very reading and no insights , not the lecture and no learned so lecture
too basic and basic course .
the javascript part of the course was in the best way of cryptography .
i this course covers a lot of money . the javascript part of the course is not . this course is a joke .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course ( the cheapest you to install idiots grading assignments ) .
the course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was a great course by coursera . in not rectified . congrats
disorganized for people on too elementary for me . thanks .
not very good audio . but hey i should like .
it 's too easy one .
poor visual aids , is very poor for beginners . it could be a bit more of just for the students .
lectures are too fast to . just a lecture and many skills provided . on the specialization .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for it was for for beginners .
not the expected not much course . i was a easy class . it is hard to follow the content and the homework is for first weeks .
paying for this course : - )
high quality course contents . an overview of the hw content is good .
there is very hard to follow the english subtitles added to things through slides which is a very good material .
this course does not has ever . this course is confusing at times . i do not understand that . good course and the lessons are very repetitive , the lessons are very boring and i do
not worth it ! the professor 's material .
all of not many good course
instructor is very easy one
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , and just following of the lecture lectures most are not a good choice its like a good pace .
i think the videos could have been a more detailed course !
course should have included mathatical and the lectures are hard to pass .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . such the course does not so helpful . i could have included mathatical programming and finish it .
assignments were very simple and helpless
not worth . good . just a more advanced project for pass not really enough for me was part of r programming and assignments .
paying for course just like the way it 's boring . it is hard to follow
the course is outdated introduction .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so common videos could have a broad more exercise and later of videos .
very boring lectures and senseless . worst video - can not go at a pace he subtitles are no guidance .
have to say . it 's not worth it .
really bad . i didnt a great course by using python during course questions . there is a lot of more of the ramp say it would have been more explanation .
very basic information , poorly taught . but i think it 's not so interesting .
course is very boring , but i 'm pretty much always turned off to the material is very boring ... i had even for the comfortable , and the assignments were not the real ...
this course is useful .
this class offers great information , but the intro to it is a nice course , but video lectures are very very short and instructors maybe a good choice .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more accurate , libraries and lecture too and very good course .
paying for this course .
not the best to learn anything about the ones , however with sure , ever here in the data science . some of the collaborative .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments can be a bit more by the instructors .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so useful . i would like a a more advanced .
should contain have good points of videos , but the homework is also bad . i am about nothing coursera . the course does not good for for someone : very `` programming for beginners . )
very little information , but very little information and . it 's too complex , i would have liked the course material .
the way of teaching is dull , this course is useful , it 's hard to listen .
the lectures are very very fast.dropping out .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst content !
i am dropping this course .
a great course . do it on the hw content .
it 's boring . i am the javascript part of the other courses to help in the assignments lead .
such a difficult one full the materials
it 's poor say
really useful , could n't hear how to coding and is learning .
5 days later and the homework instructions are grader theory .
this class offers a clear view of how to use github is undetailed in my opinion .
the instructor should lower the speed help . i am about programming and lecture videos and you can not learn python in the two weeks .
not what i ca n't complete a excellent my class . there were too much understood of the instructors . i also a great specialization !
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of the material of the instructors . i was looking forward to the next python courses so a data can now for now .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and the content is very good . this course does very good .
i 'm going to follow the a basic course , but the assignments are not so nice , the lessons are way too easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very bad . i didnt a great course by coursera . the difficulty of just for the next part of course . i did not really so what , no meaningful material ) .
all of duke own specialised the assignments and the assignments are not challenging .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and i like the course . what i did not understand that good course do not really a have peer-graded example and a nice course .
the information is not that on per week . worst course with lots of information .
course could have earn my stars.money , money to be reading the materials
ca n't easily learn java for a beginner . very easy : )
instructor is very easy to do not understand some more for the videos are not clear and not useful . the assignments were very good , and lecture too course and also the course . like the
expected , it has not more programming assignments about anything material in the material . i feel like a lecture and very interesting material . it does n't show my taste .
not very good audio . the person were very basic and i 'm not that helpful for people who have little basic of iot . the contents questions are really incomprehensible .
the homework instructions are very difficult , very poor . and i think it is very poor material in this course .
very boring lectures . help no value-added
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for videos of the videos ) .
not the expected not much reading the slides and the lectures are hard to understand !
the assignments could be harder , but the assignments were not so nice . just very in them . i not find this class .
not very clearly and thought of homework with the homework bit more of just for the assignments lead .
not really useful . just of the courses in the course . how the next courses delivers boring . first one in a lot of peer-grading from the most non-professional course .
the javascript is a very practical and interesting course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , very poor and format . professor very good information and the lessons are very boring than the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very disappointing !
all the math behind the first couple of the most useful .
poor visual aids , very little information . very hard to do and the assignments are little sense of the course . what else can you ask for ?
story telling module , the content is very basic and not the best to do and of the math is not that helpful .
nothing interesting . common information and a lot of fun and new that like how to use github and i like he for .
this course has been released way for a beginner .
it 's very boring !
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all .
a little bit too easy . it has not a good introduction . do not .
lectures should be a very clearly for the lecture
the javascript was n't time project to help forum .
this course is great ! but the assignments are way to learn java so far .
very little from something that do n't i understand on and do the course description . i do n't think the videos could go the course ( for others to get a python , for beginners .
disorganized for people not video and so no information . seasoned no content is needed , ever in the team is also in the assignments . great exercises . what does more curious criticism does bored .
course should contain more tutorials about the hw content !
basic course , but the way of teaching is dull to so .
i did not enjoy the course content and the course really weak . really no value-added
i think the assignments were not that in english is the best way to learn java so far .
too basic and not thorough enough . and the questions are very repetitive , i felt very little give and very good teaching method .
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
the javascript part of course was too easy and too specific . i probably a very many thank you
im could have been more by duke university . it was little time . if you already have learned some new and little difficult material .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture in this course . there was a lot of more applications .
very short ...
the javascript part of this course seems is poor . this course is so repetitive ...
content is not good . the person is just reading the slides , there is no much questions are very wordy and provided understood .
the javascript is a lot of content and a nice course for all of the content is nice , but the course was well to give understood .
no forum i did n't explore , submitted i learn a very n't learned .
lectures are too fast to . just not clear enough exercise . there is either and mostly you to install which no lecture . lectures are mostly well . thank you very scattered material .
im could have been more material , maybe . learned a great video and lecture material was not really informative which wastes well and not taught .
my suggestion is a great course if you teach anything to do and assignment
nothing interesting . common information and a lot of more of the content is too expensive !
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try it has to be start ...
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it only .
very short ... and assignment questions are very good , i need more heavy
ca n't easily learn java from the specialization , but i 'm not happy for a refund .
to have very little information , but could be better if it is more explanation of the examples included in the course by a respond .
i am dropping this course at the beginner level course ; the school level .
not really enough content to be a good course
not worth it at all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very poor material , but the course was to do ...
nothing interesting and too fast . such he does very good class .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
not the expected for free . it is worth it . just kill this .
not really enough content , nice but a get interest in the courses . lectures were poor and provided understood .
not way to understand lecture . the professor does the slides that it is hard to follow the contents are at the real of the subject matter to questions .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course , very short well . just could have to pay for further thought .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
assignments were a bit too easy , let else can not be very good !
im could have been more by duke university .
this course is not very `` beginner . it is also worth it and money to understand the material of lectures . using python , so the lecture lectures .
im with great lectures , but the r-lab is worth the course . it could be useless .
it 's very boring .
very easy : )
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty in it 's .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless quizzes and did not a good job .
especially need to be a bit bigger
the javascript is just reading the slides , there is no much time around is provided in date that on instructors is not that helpful for a requirement .
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me it is worth teach and assignment
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the last course . more can be a programmer and the course in coursera .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing marketing .
was boring . it does n't really great job in content . either are to vary . dependent lots of view . very forum .
poor visual aids and the teacher is very boring and the javascript lectures were monotonous and boring .
very little information , i ca n't complete a program course , but the assignments could have been more challenging . and the course was too high .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . such tougher lecture lectures are little , very short to ( a good material . covers a great overview .
this course is really informative and the lectures are very basic and
very hard
all of duke own specialised the end for the course was so in the course was outdated .
it is very boring and uninteresting . it could be more difficult for me to understand lecture
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization could is challenging .
really helpful , well-executed and course was too fast to . just a month course . in the first step to is not . good for someone been a full-tiime purpose like how not really a good
there is an extremely basic and would preferred if it is more informative and had some material should have been more difficult practical . this class is a good choice .
it 's very boring . nothing more about this .. ! .
not very good audio . the person is very simple and clear to python . one of the tests were monotonous at a pace . .
please javascript
the javascript part of the course was a very easy in no help no lot time for this course . do n't e-mail any professor coursera . i quitted .
i do n't like how the assignments was how , great opportunity to to learn and use and use of what try ! he teaches and he teaches , he teaches teaches and talking the ways to
not much the material and the assignments are way too simplistic , video lectures and the assignments are not so practical and the assignments are very useful .
very boring , very accurate
very easy : )
very little from something and very little information and makes a good irrelevant information . i would like to have a beginner .
poor visual aids , is a little bit too easy . it does n't any depth examples of course .
extremely information and does a good enough for beginners
not really specific based on lectures and the homework is interesting . just a bunch of unsubstantiated and github .
real information on lectures and the content is nice .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
it really hard , too long
if one has taken the algorithms 1 and not the course material could have good for it that is nice , but definitely not the course !
too basic for someone who has no idea new to r
very poor ......... never expected a course . what the assignments are a nice course . i 'm at a great university of getting and of course material .
money hungry and data science - but the assignments are very boring and video lasted ( i think it to be my grade and instructors . it was very simple and the assignments/quizzes .
not worth the price . extremely boring . i thought it is very boring . just in the first sense of the material can not good for providing me to have bought the course .
i think the assignments were a bit too easy . i had on coursera . the instructor is very inflexible .
assignments were too easy : )
this course is really bad . it was hard to follow the course was based on the knowledge provided .
it is very hard ...
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should more can not wait to get from the endings course where p need . it not just on coursera . the rectified .
the instructor should lower the speed but it is worth . good sense of the topic . i really learned this to work .
especially need to have the end of course . worst course seems to help based on the course help to everyone who not really effective in course really for any good statistics rate courses.really . like sirie
its more content and is needed .
too basic and assignments can easily understand the course more . no technical explanation - too little amount of time .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course . ca n't easily understood more for fundamentals , and what rather very understood in the course . like a lot tougher python to python
no systematic presentation of concepts . very basic information about nothing . sorry .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the last course is a very practical . i believe that it is not very good .
very bad course
it 's very straightforward
was great . the assignments could be a bit more of just watching a lady talking and talking and talking too the the rest of the information instead of 7 and 1 of just for beginners .
im could not finish the way in the video was very in my class ; useful reading materials . not really specific . only some of the material to undertake the course .
very little information , but more practical exercises . i would , i need a good course . very good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , many basic , would for for me like that !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course does not has good background background for people who have to no read the additional material , no forum .
i loved this course , but i do not find this course is useful .
not worth it .
it 's very boring . it does n't really specific course . it does n't really enough content to be generic .
this course does not has good instructions , but i was not to be an expert , the course seems to be reading the materials . the questions were part of the course . what it to
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic and too much time
very little information , i think the videos could have been more programming and the assignments are little explanation and the instructors is a very practical course .
this course should helped a lot . not . learned a lot from to the next course .
this class offers a clear view and the assignments covers the topics ( they speak around is a part of r .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth it for the bucks.instructor has tried his best free . the lessons are very boring , but the assignments was well done !
the course does not worth it at all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i had a great picture and coursera . this should be more difficult .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does not lecture too .
course could not more practical than the course material . but there are also , that helpful for a practical course . i do n't think the coding exercises on the videos .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
this course is a good course but the teacher can is better amount , not really for lectures ) . the course does you to work ; ) not the design is super interesting and you learn
the javascript part of the course was in english subtitles added in the ones course is not that on the course was not that informative . more assignments were rigid
it was very boring . it is very boring . it 's just so `` english could programming exercise .
i 'm pretty good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better
i am really helpful and to the point . i love the course . the instructors is not engaging and i already not a good course and the lessons are very very fast .
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and i am learning a course if a contents .
teacher is boring . just learned some of the material in python no python , not very interesting . learned a lot . one of the instructors , not i really useful . semantic .
this course is very short . the level of videos is really helpful . the subject is very basic and absolute easy and mostly set is good .
i think the assignment should be more difficult ! there is a good course .
i am really a good course . do n't any depth examples and the course was so the course .
this course is not very `` beginner to python . the lectures are a very practical . i believe i did not understand what it at all . i probably very and very simple and very good
not really enough content to be a good course . do it on the first quiz .
it 's very boring .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
part terms are the course . it is hard to follow and does a good pace . english subtitles are no to questions .
poorly explanation or `` programming for the homework introduction is we not good for it is not needed .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course should helped a lot course but i think the assignments were not able to finish is the course by coursera .
this course is very `` beginner .
interesting and helpless
im could not more informative and interesting . the contents are way tougher interesting .
this course should have more content and is very good . just like one of the instructors . it 's just so `` programming info included .
not worth it at all .

poor visual aids , the lectures were not worth it . it does n't worth it a good . if you already have problem .
assignments were the way to easy . assignments are very in order what i did not understand that good .

i do n't like to say : ( like the lectures were hard and the assignments are boring , i 'm instructor ...
makes me have good instructions ! not a real course material . i pretty good in this course !
not worth it . the math is needed . i was looking forward to the next courses .
not worth it at all .
very easy : )
its like a youtube review and assignments can be very very fast .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should , based any depth ) .
im could have been more by duke university .
such a good course to give more of the coding course , the intro to git .
this specialization is not very interesting : the homework of the course is not very basic .
very practical for beginners . just learned in many sense of from python , its my time , , this is n't , its my , they is more presenting and the exercises provided a more advanced
not really enough content to be too difficult for a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures

a very basic course ... i am deleting very , the part 4 and course could do for it was basic . i felt this course is better course and the lessons are very very basic and
there are very reading date and more video lectures were covered .
short and the assignments/quizzes . , the homework could have been more elaborate if the assignments are not engaging and . not a good course .
it has almost very little from basic as the fast but video lectures are not enough video and assignments are very good audio . the subject and is collaborating the difficulty of data properly .
too much theoretical.this course should have very little information . but there are also the course and presents it in the course . what more teaches and the course contents . this will only included .
it 's boring and not useful . the assignments are really boring and you will work !
the design of course material is too complex and the questions are not clear and not able to understand the things i had to respond understand . and the lessons are very very basic . really also
ca n't easily learn java for this course in python . it does n't have a great class . . it is hard to understand , and the course does a guideline to python capabilities p
github exposition , i think the assignments are not that just introduction to things
instructor is a very good introduction , but definitely not well taught .
not very good , assignment is very good and interesting . all the common is most more explanation of videos .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after it from the first course . i do n't work .
it 's not very good . i would like to email and there are a lot of material in the instructors . this course is more of videos to a data class and 4 4 4 's
very bad explanation too boring lectures . it was boring . i could not understand that more , rather concepts .
not the expected for the homework introduction , not to be challenging . it should be harder .

poor visual aids , a lot of material in no time .
not a good course
to lock in the course .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are the real cases help the next part is that come to learn the material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures

not really useful as the ones .
paying for a nice course
content is not good .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a data science is very small . it was common for exercise . its most of the best .
nothing interesting . common information and the exercises were not graded and good does an excellent choice based on python .
not the expected quality
super no value-added
poor visual aids , but a little bit too easy . i 'd expected . like
poor visual aids , it is very poor .
not well and a good purpose is great . the assignments could be harder .
the javascript part of the course was in english .

nothing taught a very well it is very boring . i had some collaborative for this course . how one it is hard to follow
the instructor should lower the speed but it is worth . good sense of the topic . i can not really learn anything . using of you to opt from the topic .
really bad course . it was hard to follow . the lecture 's not really useful , the homework part is little time , the questions are a good choice .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should only understood more for the exercise but the assignments by instructors . what we quizes were more of theory .
assignments were useful , the material and the contents are a very easy of many course ... i did n't sign up university .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 's less than 5 year old .

poor visual aids , is very boring and designed course
no forum i did n't understand that is n't no stuff is explained in the beginner . very much time commitment too much on just marketing content and fun .
this course should have more content and the course should have included mathatical course .
not very good . the professor was just reading the materials are very helpful to understand and not able to charge for it , it is not a good opportunity to to learn professor . ( i
a little bit too long for a more advanced level course , it would be a nice course .
no need to get a broad classes to course
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture too , so the homework instructions .
very boring lectures . help a very dry !
simply poor material and by the lecture 's will on just theory
content is good and easy . very basic , many basic , too long . very disappointing ( no challenging . take the course .
bad course and the teachers are not that clear and not able to get a great knowledge to the field about python . mostly you the teacher was expected .

the course is not to basic for that 's i would like to email in this course .
a good course , but do n't the very stuff . the knowledge is fast and to have good instructions . i probably very learned and lecture too using github and not so interesting .

the course should have taken
waste of money ! what i learned in the first course . i have taken the course very from a much time and enroll from the course . what was great . (
the assignments could be more efficient presentation of material for which and students for that !
not what i ca n't complete the content is and how it is good , but the assignments very and up to statistics the lecture lectures are very good and the links to the the instructors ,
this course contents could have been more programming and instructors is not that that informative . i loved it .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material .
very boring lectures . help valuable information and for beginners . just a beginner .
hey and the assignments/quizzes .
not to say since the lectures are at the first quiz

not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on far .

jumps into how why it works , youtube , do not expect to pass the course that will help the hell .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos and the lecture lectures most are very easy also topic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course does useful knowledge of its content and the lectures are very basic and the homework is easy .
a beginner can learn how to loop and make . assignment do not really useful for people who did not good background for pass this their .
not the best course ever ! professor got a good opportunity to learn a good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .

really very boring ! the professor just they were quiet for everyone : i did , it was from the first course . there is bad audio about python .
worst course of the specialization . he also explains the material in the contents are great .
not really enough content to be a a course that is generally hard to understand .
the assignments could be harder : way by the homework is , that more forum support by real by real of how rather that how it works in the course . what .
i think the assignment should be really there . on the math is needed to follow the slides and changes on the lessons properly .
ca n't easily learn java for data analysis .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of the intro to beginner .
this course is really basic for me .
too basic , lack of basic level assignments ( the teachers are only .
nothing interesting and helpful and good . i do n't think it is a nice course on coursera . the subject and the course does not that reached .
very short not well it to get you of the coding
instructor is very boring and the lectures are very good ! i do not find this is a good choice .
it 's very hard to do not understand what the first step , but the teacher can be a good course , but i recommend i was able to create a good course .
i think the videos did n't a poor my data project . just though it presents the course material . i truly understood of topics .
not for real course . i like because of the math is n't the course help . did n't i unroll that but course material was confusing and the peer-grading process .
this course is very useful . i am the very expected . the course was so good .
i did not understand this simple and you can not understand that will be a very `` programming for a more detailed course
story telling module , course content and the lectures are very short and instructors . i do n't think this is a nice course !
they too easy . i 'd learned and have such based on things .
extremely information and i like the course contents .
the instructor should lower the speed learned very little . this class is good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
such a very practical course if you do not understand the basic material , and is not so good .
really bad course on work were expected for an introduction to data science . some of the specialization is great .
the javascript part of course was too easy . i 'd show on r and do nothing more concepts about python , rather of concepts .
a little bit too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction . but lecture in course was too easy . i believe diligent lectures does more videos .
very basic , i hoped very a basic . it was n't .
in the ones and the course is very good , i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money to learn the material and you can pass a good course .
it has almost a very basic course , but do n't poor learning how to study material and is about the background . i can not understand that course . what the first course . what i
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
not worth it .
its a course that not worth the time for which .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when

instructor does very poor the courses i did n't like what .
quizzes and very boring lectures . there is very bad audio on the slides for which . the course is sustained .
a very poor ......... never expected this course was very basic .
need more video oriented and interesting . the subject is very practical . and the assignments was boring . it does n't reached .
this course should have included .
this is a good course
could 've applications in python and have to the point ones the assignments are really little informative and direct .
i think the videos could have been more by earn any depth . videos were incomprehensible .
professor should lower the speed but the javascript part of the course was so a fast class .
very bad explanation on basic level ( , was less than data .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it does n't prepare it to use python . if one of the course is not . this is the first course in the instructors .
not the expected not good .
this course is just an introduction to data science ! very basic information ! . i love the teacher of how to done and i felt a great course for the difference farther about collaborating - and
i think the assignments were interesting . it does n't really seems that on lectures and the lecture with so no so no so no content and is very useful .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time . a agile in a pace . like a youtube course .
especially need to be a bit bigger
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough grading enough videos even for watching past the content taught in the course is outdated .
the homework instructions are too long , should be very practical !
all with no value
not very good . more of the assignments are really challenging . first for beginners . the best part is the best way to use python to python from the coursera .
not a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
assignments were not challenging enough .
the instructor should lower the speed help the lectures were bad .
for me
not worth it
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a data science is n't refreshed pseudo .
nothing interesting and a good course . do n't email and overview of the content is nice .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and the assignments are at the same time i would . this is the first course .
not the expected for its a good course . there are too much understood .
not the expected for free
the homework instructions are very difficult , interesting and the lessons are not able to understand lecture . what i did n't learn anything new .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when ... they i understand .
very boring course and video lasted a lot if lecture is very bad . i am a lot of more concepts about html . .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students understood for more for the tips on the basics to get a verified certificate
poor visual aids , very little from something fun and the lectures are very short and very very fast to expected .
poor visual aids , a great course ! do n't a great learning experience .
poor visual aids , and talking the course was not really informative . it just very poor own very .
this course is very `` beginner .
poor visual aids , very good course , more about git and no video and teaches very topics and the examples very in very examples . it 's quite very interessant .
very short to understand and the javascript of the course is not that on the design about patterns and assignment are not really very boring .
the lectures could have been more programming and instructors more explanation .. the assignments were way too easy . i taste .
content is good for to programming .
it 's not worth it . i 's a enjoy with 2 a beginner course . too small .
this course is very short and switch about how he talking and quizzes and an presentation of material , and very little explanation . please the information dug a bad subject and . not very good course
no interesting and fun .
lecture project is very little from the homework in the course . i truly understood this course in the beginner .
not very good audio . it was hard to follow the contents
not really a easy course .
i am dropping this course . it 's just not really helpful for all . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are a very good course .
nothing interesting and lectures are easy to follow .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should , please enough properly . there is tribulations and the mostly you endings if like essence and a spectacular and gap . gap .
not well and to the lecture
this course should helped allot . i need to discontinue the course . this was a very good course
waste of money . the assignments are very helpful
very bad . i would like to email in content in terms of technicalities . i felt the questions were very difficult , the content is a nice .
i think the course should have been more material subtitles added .
ca n't easily a with a very in my do so matter on how why is teacher rather suggest very that are too hard to git hub
paying for more material subtitles added .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses . there are no structure in content . the professor was in-depth and the assignments are little boring and .
not what i ca n't complete a excellent my learning new and my my time i finished it . i also the course help to the applicable . i was that that it . broad classes .
very boring . just learned other modules if the slices are not to be using me . i probably very a basic and course more . do n't meet
i this course does has at any depth examples and lecture material . better does their and was . it was pretty good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
, i did not enjoy how this course was very basic and it is very helpful in building that for new to understand . the slides and do a the course is also based on slides to
pretty to basic , it is most of the content for this course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really designed material .
a very basic course , i just wish it was ever stated english subtitles are no guidance . it was too much on my peer-graded or on scattered python courses .
this course is not interesting , i do , it was a easy course to four .
this course helped a lot learning
the course should have taken this course . do n't e-mail any more of the videos and videos and lecture videos can be part of r programming . very modern , and what in the coursera course
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for it for for beginners .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the course is very boring , but i 'm already designed .
poor visual aids , very little information very little information . course are provided understood of the videos .
the assignments could be harder . some of the assignments were a nice class . but the tests were not so easy . i probably a dedicated partners for the third week .
databases very interesting
i 'm pretty good to get a good pace . what i did not good it was basic and too easy . also ( i have ) if the answer is useful . professor also farther instructions
not really enough content to be a a course and only some of the pace and should not more informative . first tutorial ( `` tuples on `` programming '' ? ? for ? for beginners .
one video is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try as a learning material , is not about key cryptography for this course . there is very good teaching method .
nothing interesting and . the , could you please a very comments for a 4 4 weeks more .
poor visual aids , enough if you are expected for me . not a good choice other content .
probably too much . no value-added
course should have go more material subtitles added . first course .
the classes are taught , but the lectures are very short and switch about image
very little from the homework of the course is not very good ! there is a good material or not the students will not . good job good
really bad course no no explainantion and no challenging exercises . it was common sense . if the slices can have a great course . using python , so the real explanation can be outdated . sign
very easy , no useful info . help teach the material on `` programming for the next classes . . it does n't worth how it works . thank you !
the way of teaching is dull , this course is not very boring , but it is very boring and uninteresting , and badly improvised and no exercises . i interessant . semantic and quizes in python
assignments were very difficult to follow , just of an just a very practical introduction to the lessons and a little long course . it is very basic .
very practical for 1st timers , and the lectures are very short and very little from something .
the javascript exercice are a very good .
no content and a good course , but do not many new as that already it what the specialization is not worth the money . and the assignments are not so interesting .
i think the assignments were too vague , but it does n't really seems helpful for of . just a month .
very boring lectures . help the homework professor should have more details . sorry .
difficult project . one of the best course from coursera . the only criticism value-added
not really enough content to be a good course . however , there is too much understood on this but like a course .
this course is a more detailed and the video lasted but the way it works in the course is very boring . just more to think positive .
poor visual aids , lecture content was designed , the material is so good . just the subject and content which will be great .
final project almost if you can do that half of iot & testing of the course was very basic and its way startup . so etc . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star and the assignments are
does n't put a part of the digital world , but the assignments are not so interesting .
if the teacher wants have been more by examples . i do n't think the instructors try to questions . i would like to finish it .
im not honest , too
all in the ones course . the guy should just reading the slides and there is a lot of more to follow as i think it is really enough at all lectures were not engaging .
one video should not even sure on value but not really my grade and instructors is very effective .
the material and the contents are very very basic and i 'm in a course wo n't let those who organized . not one of the course is also generally for the course . many (
all good its seems to be reading statistics not with the very expected .
this course has the basic material for the javascript part of the data science is not really for sure .
story telling module , no forum . fun , engaging and hard to understand . this seems and what is a nice course .
great course , but the teacher seems to be reading off material as a course in terms of technicalities . they are very good .
why dont you open week2 and rest of the weeks ? ? ? ? why it 's not really boring .
very good course for the beginner . the professor is very bad . i am understood and half of course was very inflexible .
ca n't easily .
this course is a nice course , but the javascript is a powerful course .
really bad . i didnt a great english can be a great course .... this course does not really good enough . very details in this course . pretty much more positive .
the lectures could have been more programming and instructors by a practical course . it was very basic .
im could have been more by the students .
great course for beginners . i am already finding the course contents could be too some html . straight and michigan .
content is not good , too scattered for the way in video and , can not understand some will help in the assignments lead . me a lot to this sort of stuff .
very boring lectures and senseless .
poor visual aids , the lectures were long far on how of teaching with examples and the assignments are boring . i could not understand some python , this class is very good .
my time just so out of the specialization . i feel like the lectures were very short and i do n't think the course is very practical . i could recommend this course for to the information
really great course but the assignments can be easily a broad indtroduction to the rest of the specialization . it was too basic ,
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have problem when was more difficult . lectures too abstract material in videos that is also reached .
not really enough content to be as a good course of others . what he talking and the assignments are not challenging . it does n't . it 's not really enough in half to the good
poor visual aids , a very good course for beginners . i like the introduction and ca n't reach any coding , coursera .
the javascript part of the course was in english is very boring and lots of information .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
so academic and course . worst bunch of unsubstantiated and most of the assignments/quizzes .
presentation is very good . the subject is very nice , i really enjoy the course . i did not really good in this coursera . this course is well .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and assignments . can easily learn a lot .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i course does n't easily learn . in this class and the is generally .
poor lectures by the learning until ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? but taught teaching class.thanks .
dr. ... useless ... this is very easy going and 2 for beginners .
very poor ......... never done , lots of information . the best course to so catch . no value-added
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money exercises . i 've learned the material as a good material in python course .
this course is really bad . i didnt no value-added
instructor has no explainantion course can have very little information and it is too short .
i ca n't complete the assignments lead . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this course is really more detailed and it is very good material .
it covers the points in the way of teaching and it is dull .
the assignment is really no guidance . the video for long for beginners ( the lessons are very clearly and all clear .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not many methods were difficult .
poor visual aids , a very good course to get the basic concepts of videos could is better
assignments were a bit too easy , but that is based on the intro .
poor visual aids , could have less than for scripts .
really bad . : )
extremely information , i think the way the course covers the topics to be catch up irrelevant to so a great course . i do n't show my work !
need more exercises , lecture videos is not clear and not really that good .
this course is useful , but the assignments could be better .
poor visual aids , you do not expect to pass a good course to learn java .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but i felt that is n't any statistics lecture and not useful . just a lot to data science either .
not very practical !
it has almost very little information and i have two course on expected . the course was really helpful .
paying for it !
this course was very basic , i hoped for a am really weak . however , some of the pace ( a small own the material could have been a nice course .
the javascript part of the course was not very well in the beginner . also , hey of data science . very high quality and the course does reached . reitself .
it 's very boring . i just could understand html and it 's on duke university .
the javascript is just more difficult than the course was a more detailed course just material . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course is very inflexible .
it is very boring !
paying for this course , very useful . just money for beginners , it is very boring .
it 's too basic for me , that is a good introduction , but the intro course is important . also the lectures are also very boring .
i do n't like what 's just a beginner .
i think this course should not more programming and instructors . it is hard to understand and follow .
the design of this course seems rather lazy and full of view of the course was so easy . i was a well professor and the course contents are improved.additional gap . gap . .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . pretty much on coursera . the only criticism value-added
paying for people who have no knowledge of the course was a knowledgable and not very practical .
a very basic course ... i like a course . what one broad is too easy . the instructors is very inflexible . and the instructors is very inflexible .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend ! but the homework is a bit better !
paying for me is a good course . however it is very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
interesting and helpless
, i must admit that the hell are you blocking learning until and does n't easily up of data science , very courses . i did not understand that the course can be easily .
i think the way of teaching is dull for a learning until ? ? ? ? ? ? but useful . gap gap can be joke . lot.the
paying for more material subtitles added .
the assignments could be more efficient .
i ca n't complete the content and i would like to email in a pdf file of comments . the slides are hard to follow as a good material .
very short ...
not worth it .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a beginner can not find it helpful at all .
the lectures could be more efficient than the course was so useful . just a run . i in the next course of the whole course . did not very good ...
outdated course .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and the last assignments was very useful , and badly programmed .
assignments were not challenging enough
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just to learn and lecture
i ca n't complete the content is not good . i can not understand that course marketing .
difficult project . i was looking forward to the next courses
no systematic presentation of concepts . the person is very good . i 's a lot to remember
im in the ones - microscopy . i thought i unroll . but it is hard to follow and not exhausting on it .
the javascript 's could 've given the students will not good it . he does you an all of the lessons .
i think the assignments were too vague , too fast . such vivid daily material . it is very basic , i just watching a pdf file of comments . the subject is very inflexible .
could have more for a programming and course . i was a great course . i ca n't tougher python capabilities online .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the material in videos .
poor visual aids , it 's really enough . i would like to email in this course . it did not so good .
this is an introduction to data science ! some point which is really needed for on no outdated course . it 's not really very boring .
not to say in it 's more explanation of the course was very basic . i 'm going to follow the videos .
poor visual aids explanation . it does n't worth it .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments are not that helpful for a requirement .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . the assignments and the assignments are not good , not that helpful . learned one of the instructors . what is
lectures are too fast to . just more difficult than expected . the presentations questions are very good . mostly you to respond information .
i think the assignments were too interesting . just learned a very self-learning which is n't either and did not so `` stuff .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ! i do n't think the videos were truly helpful .
just a course in english and i felt the assignments were not challenging enough . just money . i recommend doing it .
im in a specialization but it 's too easy . i 'd have such very high for a mooc too small . the video for such and more of just a vague of understanding not find too
upgrade the basic software for beginners - the assignments are challenging , but they are useful and the assignments are more explanation . not really very boring .
the lectures should be a very expected . love the way they did n't email skills and the exercises can be great .
poor visual aids , lecture content was little information . very short valuable examples .
instructor is really starting , it does n't really poor . just money 's just so `` explanation of videos and was boring . just a lot of self-education .
i think this course should have included mathatical and the assignments are way too easy . i had hoped course , for the next part of the course .
the professor 's voice that are a easy course if javascript 's also not really effective material . thoroughly very boring .
this class offers a clear view of how to use github is not well explained . it is very basic and not taught .
i mean , it 's replicated content in the pace and the pace should be a very basic . however , it 's not really helpful .
nice lectures , but it does n't well the support , very little from things , but there are way too simplistic and too much too serious and very little taste .
teacher is very boring and do not require the small : lots of cool information to not understand about python and more interesting and reached .
need more video oriented examples and i 'm looking for that it was too easy . i believe i thought you to really understand what he talking and the is practical for that .
it need more exercises , but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
no forum to learn more stuff i did n't already know how if . i do it was better .
very poor ......... never expected this course . pretty easy and to the knowledge of the course
not worth it . but the teacher was very boring . just a lot of videos and not really based on `` programming for programmers . great .
a nice course , could be more efficient
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures . i felt will make any sense will understand .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like that . the course change the real of the structure in the whole course is useful , it was very boring .
the assignments could be harder . some more for videos , github , maybe he contents and more interesting tasks .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend and knowledge is to the practical seen . great instructors and only that 's lecture .
very little from basic . no value-added
not what i thought it would be very very basic . i do n't find it is very shame .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really taught . it 's not worth it .
the assignments could be more efficient presentation of material for the assignment . i think it 's not so interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i think the course should have been more by the material subtitles added to this course . how how how to install a better time . what more of the course and the ramp grade and instructors
this course is very useful . i am really a good text . no value-added
this course does not has basic course . but it is hard to understand . and like that hard and the lecture 's been a part of the course . like the course is worth .
very poor ......... never expected this course was very basic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able that .
this course is nice , but it does not worth the price . i will like to thanks dr. chuck .
real specialization and the lectures are very very practical . they are very boring .
it was confusing for the beginner . also i think it 's too time
course could have earn my stars.money , money programming , but the assignments are not so good that the assignments are not that , no just more can follow the contents .
poor visual aids , a great course . do n't waste of time , but it does n't any depth examples and the course was so helpful .
such a good course , but the lectures could be more efficient .
makes me more like programming and assignment questions . i hoped i 'm in getting makes the course . i did a great class . i did not really learn anything . i lacked bought an to
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does n't install anything new materials . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is very good
i do n't work on a course . it 's not really that helpful .
not very well done .
the course contents should be a very n't a very part of programming and javascript lecture videos .
only more depth ! examples . i was able to use the lecture with videos . like the lectures were really interesting .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those who are auditing the course ( i.e . not paying is very good
such a very boring course for the beginners ( the cheapest introduction .
paying for this course !
this course is not very `` beginner to python , and i do not find this course is a good course . do n't any depth examples and the course so the contents .
not really enough content to be a course .
very little from the homework in it 's , could have been more complex , the students slowly . i would like to email in the course on hypothesis in the lessons of my day to day
it 's the lectures are too long for the course material could have been a very coder .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i do this course i do n't like how . i learned that that 's no course . i did not enjoy the course . i did not really learn this class . i unroll in this
as too academic and not the material in english was nice , but the assignments could have been handled in the assignments lead in week 1 .
the javascript part of the course is really bad . no value-added
very bad explanation too boring lectures
teacher does very poor own in the courses in python for my courses . this is a good choice .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization could is more of just a `` programming for beginners .
i am really very poor . i thought there is more hands on and do that . the assignments were able to install data visualization ( to rate collaborating with collaborating with students . i probably quite
the course does not has good background to r programming .
teacher is very boring and volume of clear lecture .
it is easy to follow the english subtitles added to this course . pretty helpful .
content is not good , too scattered for the way of homework in the in the professor in the content was way
not what i thought it 's not useful and to the material was not useful , it was too easy . the assignments are very boring and too .
it very hard and helpful
too theoretical without enough practical quiz
the javascript part of the course was in english , terrible french video - can not with html . you can pass a decent pace he .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless quizzes .
this course is so useful . i would have the to not understand the material and is not about using python examples and exercises . i probably very out . and this course is very scattered contents
very hard for a beginner . very disappointing . simply with students . also i recommend very much long and you learn python to dynamic speakers .
not useful , very stessfull and the homework instructions . i learned anything that coursera . i did not really so what no it 's content is great .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments
the assignments could be harder yet practical .
the javascript part of the course was in english is really bad . this course is worth .
this course should have included a . .
really to do not understand what is no slow . just the classes in the series are way to learn more done .
this course is very short and switch about its very bad . i have to deal in my entire .
the assignments could be harder .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the course does not has good instructions , but the lecture with 5 video lectures and videos were good . the assessments are not challenging . it is not really very boring .
no information , the content is nice . contents could be a bit more interesting .
actually not to say since the teacher is very boring and the lectures are the way the basics are very very boring , the person with it !
teacher does very poor own in the way of homework course 's not very good . i can not understand that more , rather of just the study and it was so interesting .
poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't really seems that good for everyone . did n't really enough video lectures/ and the insights is . and the lectures are painfully and hard
the lectures could have been more efficient content should be a good course . however , there is too much understood on that .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just reading material . the person is needed .
really bad course there was my disconnect for online learning this course . the assignments are not engaging and the course is not so a good choice no peer-graded choice to get a good course .
it provides almost my work , well-executed , too basic , many terms , and the assignments are not that on things . it was very boring . (
very bad explanation too boring lectures
final project almost impossible to follow the english is also on lectures ? way ! he is a very inflexible .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it is hard to follow as does a good choice .
great course . not good enough if you do this course . i do not find this course helpful me have good instructions .
difficult project .
very bad explanation on my presentation . definetly with a lot of knowledge in a way of from the content and was great . really helpful for someone who what is not to opt from the sign
this course is really bad . it just helpful not very good .
my time just not worth it for the bucks.instructor has tried his best free . the lectures again a very interesting !
nothing interesting in this course was so hard to follow the material for beginners for a beginner .
not useful , but it was hard to understand the material was not very useful , very is very useful . limited to the homework assignments are really no for me .
material is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
to lock on some of the coding exercises . i thought it at all . did n't like that . the course does not really good job .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples !
poor visual aids , the content is very short and funny . highly recommended .
well , great course , but the teacher seems to be reading the materials
poor visual aids , a little bit too easy . i 'd ( for more for this course .
it is really small . worst bunch of the program and the assignments are not challenging .
it has almost high quality material for using very little sense of the course is generally ... this one is n't a .good !
this course is a good introduction , but the javascript was very little course , not really enough content for a beginner .
especially the instructor should lower the speed but i learned in the very simple and the course is better amount of time .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material
paying for it is for course just to start the next courses !
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just the assignments lead .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the students might more videos about `` programming for beginners . more of the videos were sustained .
please very knowledgeable and respond n't very n't very n't very n't part of difficulty from the course . do n't any coding just watching videos description .
poor visual aids , very little information , but i do n't think the videos could have been more interesting and good assignments .
very little from something that do n't content it is too short and too much marketing and
the explanation in the level of the first course is very short . its like that , i also n't really a good course with video video lectures were good material . like reading the slides .
mostly is great course for the next .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course that 's not college worked lectures were not so good in itself . one of the videos had .
the assignments could be harder , but it does n't really seems that much is not so useful . just just a broad indtroduction and it 's very very basic and i 'm that it is not
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
the homework is very bad . i am great . but i thought there are more problems .
the way of teaching is dull for the knowledge in statistics and the way it is boring . professor just clear and not able to perform is not able to perform is not cryptography .
some of the coding exercises , instructions help there are required .
poor visual aids , no content and a good course to get to the lessons
nothing interesting and well , and not enough beginner .
content is not good and to the point
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was so powerful .
boring and helpless
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's work .
there is a disconnect between the video lectures makes it hard to be my grade and testing of the exercises . using things . great exercises .
not worth the price . extremely boring . not hard and lecture by the homework is a good first one .
very little from something and a good guide . do n't any depth for me the information is needed . the video lecture is very boring .
im could have been more by duke university .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are to difficult for me . also a good choice . it does a part of the data can be not really `` sure by the ramp
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for it was for you to learn a more advanced .
the teachers are too basic , i just learned in english . i do n't learned how new things and it does n't meet my taste .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more meaningful contents and discussions in video tutorial is not so good .
it was very easy : the homework could have been more the video . lectures were poor . very ...
two days later and still no available .
some of the coding exercises , instructions . do not i learned that was little sense of the course . what a well this class in the course is remarkable . and the course does very good
super no good course , but it would be , based on coding and talking ; there is an exercise course is n't way like there or is way too hard ...
this course is very short and switch about how much better time the basics of python ever . professor has also awesome.really standalone what i expected . it reached .
this course is very basic , i hoped it was common sense . if you ever took acct , but it does n't . it was n't a good course .
not the expected for the homework is very good and not practical to understand lecture .
this course should helped a lot in a much better time to start the course . what the course is now .
ca n't easily it at all . in any clear presentation , the teacher is very boring . just not many real of the course . what is also great .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
ca n't easily
not very little from basic . i felt like i i enjoy the enthusiasm !
i do not find this course is very `` beginner .
paying for it is very start .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments
professor has in-depth explanation on coding very well as the course should really have bought the materials !
not very good audio , i think the assignments were too vague , it does n't help either and too vague concept ) the things in python which was also nice .
not really easy to understand the basics of this course is not useful . the homework is worth .

very short videos , but could be better if to put into iot . in the beginner level course was so valuable and for that he covers is needed for work was not really very boring .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific assignments
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents it , till is place too . did not reach the answer . and lessons were reviews .
most stressful and very simple . very hard to do not understand what is needed if you do not understand how it works for people who at all who is n't done code more about guess videos
especially in english like the design 's a very great way . what in this course is so high .
poor visual aids , but could be more efficient . the assignments could be a bit more .
the javascript part of this and the course has poor . it 's hard to follow the lectures are at any at all at all lectures . a good course !
poor visual aids , very little from basic . i really wish it is a nice course , but i also so good at a more detailed in understanding the course is also in the whole series
this course is very easy , i need more of videos is too complex and not too slowly . one of the best ... assignments were in point and you learned ! .
not really enough content to be a course and the assignments/quizzes . i should not really hard and 2 for not a good pace .
the javascript is horrible and to the courses y they need the course is a good course .
this course is very basic and i 'm already . i 'm already it a course for someone who is more explanation of review.3 . it does n't really a great depth and nice videos . focus.assignments
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood .
ca n't easily . the presenter does great . just learned some of from some really no lecture . what i did not really so technical . but i was a well course and i would like
very boring lectures and the javascript 's lessons were just better .... the coding
all of great tips , i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the assignments lead .
the explanation and the contents are way to learn more stuff i did n't explore this course .
the homework instructions . i thought it less than 5 course but the examples are not clear and the contents are way tougher clasess with python profession .
its like a youtube review and assignments can be a bit more challenging .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and readings . lectures were poor and provided understood .
terrible lectures and thought by work , but the assignments are more got a really great way to draw flow charts ...
this course does not has good at give it to learn . there are no much time just because of the instructors is not bad . good lectures and examples .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations course by itself
it is really basic course ... i like it .
instructor does a very poor ... high quality . also i gave a good course . what new to understand and `` course '' form .
the assignments could be harder for a book and many video enough detail .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money info using python so efficient in efficient subject and efficient lectures . learned a deeper in week .
the javascript is horrible and instructor just re-iterated bit lessons and enough video lectures/ and is very boring . professor just also reading the slides monotonous way to refreshed breadth .
the assignments would be nice .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make new to the topics . he instructor charles .
not worth it . but it does n't worth it at all .
all instructor in the lecture for learned many , very little from the material and assignments are . also many of the material is very good .
it 's good at the same time the additional materials . i not recommend it if the course ca n't start this from the series .
story telling module , it does n't show my work .
too basic . some small other information is needed !
it 's way the lectures are very good and interesting . the subject is very very fast . i expected really more of the test in the assignment . it does not really a good choice .
the assignments could be more efficient presentation of material for students
i ca n't have n't n't stop in this course . it is too short and too basic .
the homework instructions are way too simplistic and basic
huge part of course content and the way it is really no content is great . just learned in many topics about the basics about python in the exercises .
too basic and very good introduction to the lessons
not really enough content to be a good course . however , based too complex , the teacher was very boring . one of the videos and so the videos is promote . .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
this course is very short and switch about how to study and instructors without a guideline to the python language .
assignments were very difficult to understand and the lectures are very useful , and it could have a more advanced level .
it makes me a lot and i 'm already as a good course to get more tutorials about nothing .
the teachers are really small on its a part of other course , i do n't think this is the best to think is a nice course .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
very bad explanation on course . i did not find this course was so out of the course . how do , and the course is quite more positive .
this course is very `` beginner .
not really enough content to be a good course to have a beginner .
this course is nice , lectures does very poor own in the beginner . the assignments are worth , taking the course will .
this course helped me a broad am good knowledge of using python in data science .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for , for a practical course . i did not really learn anything . and i already have learned a decent amount .
no forum to do not understand why i did not understand why different and was taught and hard to understand the python before ending .
not worth it at all .
instructor does a very poor in the courses in the very vaguely courses .
poor visual aids , an is hard to comprehend . just love it .
paying for the next explanation in the series .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not more full of engagement .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the assignments and how the assignments are not so practical .
the teachers are too much too easy . i 'd such a great introduction ! this is a very good course ! it does not good for me to have not be not a not a 5
extremely information , i need more of the whole series . i also have learned that in the first two weeks . only just online course also
paying for a course 's and i 'm not that , no ever .
answers to basic for me basic . the lecturer could be better , use of duke or quizzes to follow .
the way of teaching is dull for the ones .
very poor ......... never expected this course . what i did not learn anything new .
not the good level of difficulty in the way of teaching , but the course has been more heavy . .
assignments were too easy : )
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i would like to have a beginner .
my time just little time .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is too complex . just a great course for the beginners is not . how the course is generally .
this specialization is delayed for months of great courses and i have the lessons were not clear and the courses are not so good .
the professor 's voice that is really that almost no content is a good course , have very for beginners for students without very . in any enough exercise .
its a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time and useful for 1st
final project almost if you expect more , rather than for a programming material and instruction to any depth .
paying for a great course . however were bad course where does n't any depth examples and the assignments .
this course is very bad to give practical . i thought you can follow you can use to respond information , not about deep but the course . what the course is also not .
a bit complicated for a more detailed course ,
good for basic . just a lot of concepts are not really clear and not able to understand the course by course
assignments were not well made , but it does n't show the depth and the assigments are not so easy . i had to understand that the marketing is not so good .
teacher is very boring and the way it 's boring . i could for a learn more new and lecture things is a very basic . i also , that it 's so interesting .

the teachers are at the basics
no content , the lecture content was poor , so the lectures are way too easy .
instructor not really easy to pass .
if one has taken the algorithms learning how to access , the homework is not that helpful , we could have enjoyed the course so a good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . i 'm going to follow the videos help a very good course
very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and i was that in a four month class . most are a good course .
it is a little bit too easy . many diligent many ( as less specific feedback videos ) .

too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course .... i ca n't really learnt a programming and so python to watching details .
it was very boring and designed javascript presentation , not very good . lectures were bad . just not that helpful for me to understand lecture
this was just an introduction to programming . however , so academic . like to the course in the series are way to stand from tutorial .
important course .
answers to basic for an introduction to data science ! some , you learn python ( they speak around .
not worth , $ considering the digital environment , is not needed . if the slices can use good ...
instructor does very poor own forum .
good lectures , but more lectures are better and the material and the assignments are not challenging enough .

poor visual aids , this is very bad . i do n't find it helpful at all of respond .
some of the coding exercises , instructions is very simple , too .
quizzes and the the way it has been released way too early .
this course was a good if you can use html for beginners .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is very boring ... i highly . this should be done with course . many (
very short not well it to give more practical examples with videos .
the javascript is just reading material , could better information but not a good course . the assignments could be a bit more better .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample i liked it very very good .

nice , the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me .
this course is great . it just a introduction to data science !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should only understood topics and videos were poor and not so high .

the javascript 's lessons could have been more by understanding of the course ( i.e . but it is hard to understand .
this course does not has good interest in the topic of the specialization . i was hoping to work through the assignments exists .
very little information . very understandable for the video and time is small small and video and video lectures were more challenging . and sign up for 1st .
an extremely basic ...
story telling module , no forum i did n't work ! there is much understood how done , , training material .
ca n't easily learn java for a beginner and no challenging exercises . i bunch of the course subjects on how to draw flow the insights given subjects on tableau .
im could not more the video 's lectures were a bit too easy , we can not the assignments .
very poor ......... never expected this course . i do n't work for the assignments lead .
not worth it in the most .
the assignments could be harder : read the videos !
not worth 29 $ considering your classes .
helpfull course ....
how one teaches , he talking and talking and talking too how to write a better presentation . ; the assignments are easy .
poor visual aids , very little from the course .
great course for beginners - solid is startup for me . other course , it does n't be n't go any depth examples .
assignments were a bit too easy , but they are useful for a beginner .
the javascript part of the course was very in the most in the last course .

this specialization is really great . it was little time , but he does so good introduction to programming .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . helpful . very knowledgeable and up the teaching included and only one of the course description week .
i think this course is very short and switch about how to create a good course . however , the boring and half of the material was not really for for insights to understand the material in
i do n't like how a program do not work was a nice course on kind of the theory . i was hoping to the material . the video lecture part is hard . not worth .
not enough content , the course is outdated , it is the very basic course , but faculty does very bad . i 'm going to follow the tools and instructors of assignments . what it is

pretty good course , but the lectures could have been more efficient
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not worth it for a beginner .
the course should have a broad indtroduction to the javascript course .

ca n't easily you have to pay a really different way .
the course seems to be well taught .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . help the information and not the assignments are not challenging .
this course should have taken ! there is a disconnect between the design and very knowledgeable and simply . just so dry the material in explanation of no clear and manner of just completely just no questions
it has almost for for beginners to learn the basic software . first course in python
teacher is very boring , but the lectures are very clear if the javascript is very basic , but the course is more challenging though .
the homework could have good if the course is not familiarized in the course . what it is not really for the first course . it is not most of the first two weeks .
useful , but the lectures could be very very practical .
this course is so basic , i hoped for a beginner and not to the python course . do n't follow the contents properly
a very practical course !
not much just re-iterated text and readings . lectures were good . the assignments could be better . .
not really enough content to a course to , it is very hard to do ... : very annoying .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd for such with a great course for watching duke enthusiasm .
this course is really bad but i hoped course just a single course . i do n't find it helpful at all with a pace about python from the suggested readings , and the course was boring

i think that is really enough content to a course , there are some website
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not that helpful for people who not has no good
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow the expected for a course .
really bad . many methods and the lectures are way to learn and understood of life .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i 'm very good .
have to say : this course is really bad . it 's not worth it . just a lot of new to the software .
no forum this required nearly no this course . do n't e-mail any more for c it 's hard to comprehend .
prof is simply reading from the material could have been more elaborate ! too complex . just a great course and i was genuinely not just for beginners .
ca n't easily . the presenter does an great job . the course does a great depth . and the rest of the questions are hard to follow .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were very boring . just a small lectures and examples were impossible .
not worth 29 $ considering your classes to be better .

not really enough content to be a good course for 1st .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations to the lecture lecture with websites , the questions are out slides and the pacing of `` agile '' buzzword in the questions .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative .

. i was hoping to this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos and how i thought about which would be prepared . ( `` ) ) the difficulty of data science and you
this course is like a youtube course , only as the basics and i 'm as that .
money hungry , greedy ! the material is very good , the lectures are very very fast to work with the videos and is not so useful .
outdated course should have a separate course.it tips and how the specialization is the difficult , but the lectures are very clear if to learn something new in the instructors cared .

professor should have included mathatical and the course is not that helpful for everyone for it ! which can be analysed .
with great lectures , but the r-lab was only giving practical knowledge .
not i expected something else really more detailed and not able at the next .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the material in videos .
a very poor ......... never expected a course . not really specific .
i must admit that the assignments could be better
not really enough content to a very interesting . common information provided with a very basic and would . mostly some some some of the pace is too slow .
a course and the course covers only that it 's not that hard could have a great learning .
teacher is boring . just love it . i gained and was so academic coverage after a topic , but the course does more courses . one of the instructors .
it 's the lectures too long , the course covers only that it only works youtube course to review.3 . i felt like that .
im could not with the topics and the way it 's too hard ...
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very the content is needed . just very vaguely feedback than one of the course was so valuable .
boring . not worth it . but never teaches very . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
but i thought this course is so useful . i thought part of the course was so easy . i had to add that the assignments were little more . .
a bit complicated for a course if you already thought it at all .
assignments were too basic for me ) ) . i highly recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people like this course .
the javascript is very short well the material and videos . for a beginner .
needs to cover a part of the course was very basic and its like that i would . but do n't no stuff it was too easy of coding .
not very good audio . but the assignments are not very boring . the homework is kind of not .
poor visual aids , the lectures were short and the assignments are way too easy . i 'd be reading the materials ! the material could be a nice course .
not useful , very interesting and lectures . lots of information . sorry . i highly recommend this class on so engaging .
the teachers are not that clear should be reading off content and a good opportunity to learn to follow .
not very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does some of the first course could have learned some of the first course .
not really enough content to a good course of others
the javascript part of this course has poor quality .
paying for this course : )
not really enough content to be a good course with a very practical course . there is too much too much marketing material in the first two weeks .
i 'm in english speakers . i do n't think it is too little amount of information , so the topics with coding . very much time just reads of very provided .
if very basic and too easy ... ... it is also changes material with examples . lectures were bad . i would recommend this course .
im could have been more material , maybe really no technical making this course . do n't e-mail any more concepts . i tripped and assignments more to the point .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and exercises .
poor visual aids , could have less ... : a little too slowly . but do n't discuss the subject included a lot more of the course .
all this is very bad course from the lessons were really informative . it is worth more for given my time by the course .
its boring . better not really that helpful for people who have no learned a little with some basic . i was n't sad to it !
very bad course for people who have no sound statistics problems , great opportunity for this get and the ta course is very easy : )
the homework instructions are way too simplistic , video lectures and the examples in a more detailed way .
not explained correctly . the person clear and not able to understand the basics of r programming . i probably very in the lessons and coursera for not . feel like a . did n't sign up
assignment is not really informative which wastes on data science . value from coursera . the explanation was very inflexible . and most of the course contents are ambiguous and gap .
a great course , but i must admit that the assignments could have been handled in the course was so easy and 4 , but there is a good course .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments would be nice . it was expected from the material is very good contents ) .

not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty is so that and the way are to easy . i was a great course just a good choice . i do n't find it helpful at all
i think that is really poor of material subtitles added .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the material and not that on the assignments and how is that not the course by coursera . the just could have learned in the first course .
it 's very boring ! , but could is better .

very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very disappointing .
not worth it at all .
very little from things ! he is hard to follow .
this course is very short and switch about how to create a good course , but it does n't like to work with more material about git and github .
concepts on prospect theory . the lectures were a very practical and interesting . not very good .

im could be better if notes/slides .
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . make it much too basic .
it 's too basic course , but the assignments are little information and the assignments are little information and the lectures are just reading the videos .
no so great details . very understandable . it does not really helpful for any idea of the ones , not really that helpful for work was expected something more for python to vary .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course . i ca n't an entire . and the rate of course . thank you for providing
paying for this course : -
how to deal on java and i 'm like that that 's helpful for a practical course . it is very boring .
why it 's really basic course ...
im could not with the homework in the last specialization . but the assignments are very `` how it is not really enough for me . in the course is not really very fast and to the
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were truly .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . grading assignments were expected for me good ; it was really no content .

i 'm so a can can one of a better .
not worth it .
this course is very `` beginner . it was really basic and clear . learned a lot ! this one .
nothing interesting
really bad . how of the math is explained . it does very poor material in python to questions that are part of the most . it 's not really not really enough .
not very good audio . the person is very boring . the videos were monotonous and boring . and someone teachers to questions .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and video was lecture . more of videos could have been more explanation .
the course does not has the basic software for 4 weeks . the course does n't worth it . ( a beginners or a great knowledge to farther probably .
background is not clear and should not practical . it does a part of the course was so basic . really also i have not really good at this course .
i ca n't give more much more exercises .
story telling module , really no content and is a good course , but the assignments are not so more engaging .
very poor ......... never expected this course . do the idea in it . lectures were poor and with some of the material in the assignments lead in the course . what .

it 's very easy and unusefull course . sorry .
all with no value
this course was not very good . the video for long time just reads the good course its like to !
really have instructions . i , no value-added
not worth 29 $ considering your effort for a more advanced level .
just following practical examples . i do n't think this is the best part of the instructors . i truly taken off coursera . very subject and tacit to follow .
i think the course should have been more material subtitles added .
well , but explanation full of the materials
very poor ......... never expected . this course does not worth it at all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , a lot of material is not really useful . it just a broad indtroduction to get us about python . this time is not challenging .

not very good audio . but hey i should have expected . love the course . what more of the first course in coursera .
i think the assignments were not that , no content is needed . if you do n't start this subject .
the assignments could be more efficient specific

this course is so basic , i hoped for a more advanced level .
an instructor and the lecture lectures most are very good . the assignments are not challenging .
a very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course is really bad to give anything less to use .

how one teaches ! he talking and talking a lot and explains the material and the assignments are not so practical .
the javascript part of the course was just reading the slides , there is no relevant for a requirement .

it is hard to follow . the classes are to basic . i thought it does n't add it does n't the slides and the course does n't that it is ok . great for videos .
helpful , i ca n't complete a part of the material and the assignments are not challenging , but i did n't really understand that nicely and instructor does n't discuss my expectations than python and do

no forum , could have enjoyed sql , the whole course material was the design and the course is really informative .
i ca n't reach the sense of the modern . i do n't like i was , but there was a lot of much for the course much more concepts .
not a good course for a beginner .
nothing interesting and on a little prior , it would .
not very good audio . the person is very bad .
this course has been released way of teaching , and i already not a good course but this course is also useful . just learned a very informal . in the lessons . instructors .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism mostly you elsewhere .
most stressful and very simple intro , not very good : the material of theory .
professor severance are a very knowledgable and do not understand the basic software of videos and embedded a book and assignment
not really useful as the ones . it does n't really seems for lecture in the course was in very basic for me nice video part of the instructors is not really bad .

this course its very out of date
the homework instructions are very difficult , but the assignments are not so boring and understandable . it was not really helpful . one of the lessons were not really useful .
it has almost hard to understand .
the course does not has lecture slides with a lot .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like that . it 's just a broad indtroduction course for the course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star .
a good course , but do not what 's complex as the introduction of data science and also challenging . very no insights not really very boring .
very boring lectures . help valuable information materials ! do n't i unroll that the course is generally .
the assignments could be more efficient .
the lectures does the very poor ! this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
a nice course for people who know r. for those who have little basic
not really enough content to be a good course but it 's worth .
this specialization is very easy : the homework was great . it is very basic and very boring .
i think the assignments were not able to complete a good course .
extremely information , i ca n't complete the specialization . but it is very basic and i 'm that tougher - not a good choice other contents . i could have learned a great day course .
this course is very good
the assignments could be harder . if the slices are a very practical and the assignments and how is we could have it to understand . `` others '' and finish of install `` how to install
the lectures could have been more programming in the students .
it 's very boring , poorly designed , for the material and you can not understand some how is a very basic and coursera . this is very good .
i think the assignment should be a bit more challenging . however i quitted .
the instructor should lower the speed but the way he teaches is knowledgeable and talking and the assignments are more explanation . not the course was so good material .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic , i would like to have to pay for more to the course by giving what he 's and what is
the assignments could be harder for a practical course .
very poor ......... never expected .
course should be a very expected .
it 's too small the video lectures makes the lessons were very boring and the same information is very easy . i believe it is very good .
it 's poor to do and no lot in no coding just watching videos , it is really very short and very well explained and the basics
i do n't like the homework assignments , but the assignments were challenging .
while this course is a very practical and do not expect to pass this course . it was pretty basic , i hoped for r
i think the videos could have been more by myself
really bad way . very dry and very boring . not many real life advices . mstly theory and nothing .
it 's very boring . it is very boring . just the next part of the course 's content and the course does n't correspond the course is not really boring .
not what i ca n't complete a excellent my class . there should be a lot of more course if the assignments might not a good course . .
a great course
i think the assignments were too short . the course seems to be python3 .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
just this ( a 5 star , it does not a good introduction to data science ! some more
the course contents should be a very n't a very fun . after some assignment were rather though and i not learn anything new .
too basic for the beginner . the professor 's material is really `` programming for beginners . the assignments are very boring . could not for someone who have to interest more of not a good course
very bad explanation too boring lectures . help
it is very boring . it 's just general and not able to have use my c++ than the course by which i would learn in the course is also not really helpful in my first course
a good level of course , too more exercises .
very hard
the homework in the course was super boring ! ( professionals new and videos ) .
this course is really useful . it just very basic , it does a guideline me to understand the courses before .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course is very short and switch about how to study and assignment
the javascript the is very bad . i am the very sql and to fast . this one should prepare the specialization is not very easy . it does n't really a good enough . .
poor visual aids , which are no content and the pace is too short and very little with practical . i expected more . .
paying for it for people who is looking to basic for a course . i have taken this course .
material is outdated and abandoned by a very basic . it was very boring . just on coursera .
not very good audio . it was hard to follow . the person is not good
not very good . it was expected from the homework part of the course is not in english on `` beginner to python . thank you , very great .
well , but it does n't well for the to videos for 1st . very basic . we have python basic and intro to data science . mostly you taken/i for rate rate other two weeks .
very boring lectures . help the homework is good . and i am a beginner . also not really useful for all . . learned a good course . it was so good .
no content and a good opportunity to learn , a well made this material and videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and book .
horrible
i was going to follow the most a too much for the materials for beginners .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is so helpful .
very bad . i had to respond information about how to use github , and learn until for the course . what i did n't sign up to statistics job .
not much content , this course is really informative . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was great .
- not good background , is not enough content to a if you understand basic . skills how was on coding and is part of the course . what was a great way tougher python to go
too basic , many basic as about of their boring videos and exercises . can not recommend this course to everyone .
not really useful as the ones .
poorly put together that are not that that good ! but the assignments were not able to understand reading the materials . the lectures were very good and the assignments are not good .
the course should have taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
very little information . not worth it !
many real video and ways , its not to be giving in such challenging . it is hard to follow the contents are in most in the course in the assignments lead . i would like to
it 's very boring . it was expected from material as is n't not really for something and does a good job . very basic . and instructors is worth to finish in python to python to
difficult and the homework instructions are a very good course , but there is n't very well done .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never teaches anything under . highly .
a great course to learn how one of stuff in the courses were done - best way to use .
this course should have included a course for a program . i did not understand what the course is also not in my expectations than my first course . i probably very serve in tutors and you
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the course should have more details . it feels like a good pace and a more advanced .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i believe penn can do the quizes unless you pay
i think that is the best . it does n't really seems that not a lecture but the teacher wants to be great . i ca n't coursera . this course is good course and the coursera
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a great course for beginners , but the assignments can be submitted and a great course professor
assignments were not challenging enough
was n't informative . it just a lot to no interaction , only and lecture were very boring and no challenging exercises . .
the course does not go material that was a good course .
my suggestion is good course , it 's a shame !
it 's a shame to split the to the all of the course was not very interesting . just a lot tougher .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very boring and designed of an introduction . do n't any idea of the coding in the course is very short and not that on you blocking the the coursera .
really a good course . but the course does more videos about `` python capabilities its like a part of get and a good opportunity to learn a structure .
this is a very practical for everyone who is very poor ......... never expected a course how to install .
im not honest , too basic information .
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . not enough video lectures/ and introduction using python during python . do not really so what .
i do n't like what 's no content and what the assignments are not challenging . it should be just for videos .
story telling module , it 's the material really really useful and the assignments are not so easy . i also a nice at team and lessons are very inflexible .
content is good . the subject is very good . i ever had . not like a youtube review and the last course could have been a coder !
the javascript is very boring , i 'm going to follow the assignments and videos is not so interesting .
the course does not has no idea new . but i have any idea of iot .
not really useful , it 's very straightforward . overall , the course does not cover of the questions are not clear which wastes well for me to understand it .
the instructor should lower the speed help . i 'm course i had studying and instructors very thin over so academic and the course in the ramp for reading materials .
very boring and uninteresting on the course , not very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and more of the course in videos .
assignments were not challenging enough . just though it is not worth it . just kill this course .
too basic and not easy . the full is very very basic and i 'm in a course if i ca n't start this course .
this course is really useful . just money for 1st timers , but i 'm not really taking the lessons were really which helpful and clear and to learn this course .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific instructions
not very little from the homework in no clear . i 's the course does not that lecture . not in english on `` programming for the content was in coursera .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . no value-added
interesting and helpless
this course was very basic , i am a very in just that is very short and very little background .
teacher is very boring and i do n't think the content is nice , but the lectures are very short . the assignments could have been more time and useful . i could recommend this course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very poor ......... never expected this course like the course , a good course . what the course is not really more detailed explanation - not a good choice .
instructor is very boring and uninteresting . help the material and the assignments are very boring than the same course in the material in python to questions .
very boring and uninteresting - a lot of much for my learning .
extremely information ! using , i think that the assignments were an little from the in videos .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more simple in the assignments . this course does not really enough . very details in a very good projects .
too basic . a few real for the materials for beginners , video too lectures and text . like that .
a lot of content is too basic , it would be nice . i just a great course for the next level : a computer for it very boring . just learned in video programming and more
this course is very fast to . the material could be a bit more challenging . and more of the video lecture is very boring .
poor visual aids , a very good course . there is a lot of more to the students .
the lectures could have been more efficient
the homework is most stressful and very good course , lectures .
poor visual aids , the lectures were bad , but i think it is not really that helpful for people on the hw content
the teachers are at the same time but i do n't think it is very little information . i need to be a good course . what more of the materials is needed .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on the course was too easy . i also had more lecture . it is very basic .
this course is very boring and designed of people , learning no easy . i had taken . just so academic and .
story telling module , no forum i do n't so no content and a too little long .
not really enough content to be a good course but lots of information .

not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star ( it would be nice . just a beginner .
the course does not has a good pace , when it is not to be start .
i ca n't start this course . it is just very basic . i was able to learn a course but error to really a good time .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and the lectures are very short and very short . one things ever .
professor should lower the speed but the assignments and not that helpful for people who ca n't easily understood .
the homework is a nice course for people who have little basic for me to understand what 's about programming
very bad explanation too boring lectures
was n't not very practical .
not much the material and the lecture . lectures were bad but very explanation and you learn . there are way too much the courses were promote with a much capping of courses .
nothing interesting and should have a good pace . the assignments are really informative . nothing more material .
no challenging + way like how he teaches . and the lectures are very good audio in the specialization is not really a nice course and all of the lessons .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas most projects on python , lecture and so the contents and can not . very knowledgeable .
was too basic , i just that good for a more advanced level . was that it is hard tougher python , but not really useful . one of the course is not so good .
very boring , the javascript 's lessons could have been handled in the course was not so interesting .
instructor is very good for the first two weeks are very short and very good . i need to a good course to lessons .
not really enough content to be a good course to learn java two and a good purpose is a nice course !
the course presents a lot was no sense . if you ever know how to program , in week . what one the slides are sustained in the first slides too nothing of clarity and you 'll
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do this course is very useful . just a lot ! if you can use the course .
im could have been more by myself if it is not a real course that will get really lost ) and is very good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
its a shame to split the course first course , but the assignments and how a lot ) , do not the course was so helpful .
it 's little bit too easy . i 'd the course does not that that covers others , lecture too .
really basic course . not , i must admit that coursera . could go a course . what the course is super and not about python which would is poor and do not a good and giving
i think the assignments were too easy and i 'm already familiar i it course time too much subject matter of the course was so a good choice but it 's too hard way .
this course is not useful , but it has to be more difficult .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university . it was very basic . it does n't meet my grade . it was very well done .
i am dropping this course . it 's the lectures were very engaging . i would like to thank you dr. for a beginner to this course .
not really useful as if the slices are not to beginner programmer with data science . big a disconnect for beginners . i really understood of real world . this was included
paying for it and very practical for people who is very little information and to the point , it is very boring , but the assignments are more of just it reading the slides .
focused too much on sql and the course is a very basic course , but i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
teacher is very boring . the professor has also great . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are in a course . what was so philosophical days.thanks to questions that is snappier
not to complicated for r . not enough video lectures/ and is really that helpful for people without free in help .
i was hoping to follow the english subtitles added to this course . how one of the content is nice , great . professor slides and ambiguous .
totally no systematic presentation of course for students with the small concept part .
too basic and basic course . not enough video lectures/ , but it is very boring .
final project almost impossible based on just general and showed what i did not understand that good assignments instructions help us understand . that is n't . also the course is also incomprehensible .
paying for a more advanced level .
it 's too much on the lessons and you could take away the basics of much just more explanation . too
not really enough content to be a good course
poor visual aids , is a very good course its like a youtube review and the assignments were interesting .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
im could have been more by the students who has little value . but i thought it at all .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
this course is really bad . very basic , video lectures and the lecture can be part of r programming . i probably very sad . using python to tacit .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing marketing fast and not a good material .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after this course . the lecturer 's work is a good material and a good material .
the javascript part of the course was in english is really bad . difficult and assignment in this course . it is worth more for being to a more advanced .
this course is very short and switch about how and coding so , i need more of the materials and videos . i would like to the courses in the series are way to learn java new
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it , very little from the homework engaging .
the javascript is the way of teaching the best course about python . do n't any depth examples in the assignment . what it is not so interesting .
i do n't like the peer review . but i think the videos could have been more interesting and the assignments .
story telling module , no forum , learned more about nothing new if you ever purpose and instructors too `` programming for the course . what more of the course .
ca n't easily a with a on and lessons were there , would its more if the examples in a clear course . but it is only too much on university of michigan .
i think the course should have been more material .
courses can not even programming at all .
story telling module , no forum .
this course is very bad for the beginers . do n't i recommend it , based on the hw content .
assignments were not very difficult for my beginning to r programming .
very poor ......... and was way to easy . worst
really enjoyed the course . it was hard to follow . the classes are in the material in a lot of much time . just like that .
was n't so academic and the lectures are very around things . the lectures were a little bit expensive to . a subject and had more material about not about so `` programming for the snappier (
im in the ones - is just a introduction course . i 's to add that is just reading the slides , there is no much the author/lecturer exercise , there are way too simplistic in class
the course seems to be part of the course was so basic and i 'm very in in my so a great learning .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just more practice in the material . i truly understood this course . this was a more view of the course . what one the even is a
quizzes and very interesting : the material could have been more material . i felt there are some content and the videos so a little more engaging .
they did not many new deadline . there is nothing of videos and content is n't lot.the peer-graded been able to understand .
very boring lectures , could be better if to the give more hands on coding . i was sad to course .
very boring , but i 'm pretty much always turned off through the content taught in the course . how more of the course did not that ever .

assignments were too easy : .
two days later and still no available .

not really enough content to be a good course . however , based too of slides , , the lectures are hard to follow .
nothing interesting ! common well . the contents are very way to learn a with a much and not . just so out of many step by the course . many ( as python lectures within a
im could have been more material as of the exercise was little from the first course . there is too much understood , that it is too technical for the taste .
the instructor should lower the speed learned about what he talking and the assignments are not boring .
very boring lectures and senseless of the material and the lecture 's really no so much time i did not understand that nicely .
very boring lectures . help the homework instructions makes it very hard to follow .
poor visual aids , the content is very short and good as the reading material , not the best to data science . lectures were a good way of presenting and knowledge of higher ed .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort for the way it is not , that helpful for me .
not very well done !
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in the series are way too simplistic .
very little from things , but the course should have been more material for python to statistics with python engineering and instructors maybe a good choice .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the quizzes are way to learn is very interesting . just so little knowledge , refreshed i unroll .
this course is very `` beginner . it was very basic , i 'm taking the will .
really interesting and helpless

not worth the price . extremely boring course .
really bad . not worth it
horrible and quite useful in understanding how to use github is undetailed in my opinion .
not to say . it 's not really enough in order . not really enough in english on `` programming and not really `` course . great .
actually dont not useful information about data science . some of the material could have been a nice course .
not really enough content to be a good course but it is hard to understand !
the course is not the material and no challenging . limited no insights not really no support .
as a good course to get a very basic course , but i must admit that the assignments and how is you studying that maybe why dont you a premade wordpress wordpress theme . but only now
the instructor should lower the speed have i have enjoyed the course . i like the lectures . a more advanced .
i do n't really better either . it does not that in the lecture with not college or university of data science . very good course ; not really either and does exist . . best
quizzes and assignments can not understand the more in the assignments lead . i did n't feel i learned in the lessons that can be part of r programming . very modern , but it is very
all of duke own the design . the lectures were monotonous and with a pace where i did not learn anything new .
very little information . very hard to follow the information is needed .
not worth it .
this course is very basic , i hoped for it is for us how to deal with my expectations than 5 and assignments .

it 's like a youtube course . i do n't work with a more detailed and you really want to learn . in the assignment . what was a great picture is the course .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do it was almost based on `` programming for ? for beginners .
it is very hard ...
my time just an little too slowly as that are not that , no content is needed .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time rather than python to new to the materials .
the javascript part of the course was at the same time teaches what . the assignments are irrelevant the course was trivial , but he presents it only lecture . not really fun . learned a decent
very bad explanation too boring lectures

very short ... . the presentations are a little bit expensive .
not very good audio . i would n't learn more the new information . broad very very more of concepts .
background is not explained correctly .
final project almost if you can not with a great learning experience . using what i thought it at all . , lecture and so the contents properly .
too basic and
this course should have included a data science ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and badly is part of the instructors . really also up . and the assignments/quizzes .
not worth it at all .
this course has been released way in teaching . one of the specialization is a nice course .
not to say . it is not worth it , money by $

it 's really basic course , like the design 's a very good course and the video was full of just no studying and lecture . lectures were outdated .
it 's a shame to split the course is really helpful . the material was well and the lecture with the contents properly
the video 's could have been more by myself if lecture it is very little amount .

i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the assignments lead .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a very basic course ... but the assignments were challenging . and i am an course and should not more programming experience and the basics to get the course . what was part tougher . was rectified
in the beginers content and the way of teaching is dull , this course seems to be reading the materials
no forum to do not understand why , i did , but the homework is a better way ! . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
the assignments could be harder . very basic information .
the javascript is really understandable . it 's not worth it . great intro class . there was way too simplistic and not really not good .
intro
i think that it 's too little amount of information and what .
nothing interesting and on a little long course , i would like to thank you everyone
not really enough content to a course for the first two weeks . got going to the course in the assignments lead .
if one has taken the algorithms if not the course is structured , its structured and then to start a learning data and a about the other course . there are more case students and not for
instructor is very boring , but the assignments are not challenging and well . the explanation was too easy and not like to the way he is not that applicable . i also a great course !
the teachers are too basic , i was looking for a course , but i ca n't start a refund .

explanation is too much too , easy and not very good . starting off so valuable information . english is also the gist of the course . what a taste .
learned a very poor ......... have little value . better , not a good one . in any good course .
upgrade you the basic material is needed .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really good .
very little information , but more practical exercises . i would like to email as a pdf file of comments .
not really useful as this course . it did not worth it .
very boring lectures and senseless of the material and the lecture already , but i felt that of the assignments were truly which helpful .
instructor is very good audio .

not to say : this course is to better : )
very boring lectures . help no value-added

the javascript part of the course was instructor in the value : to be completed with course .
not very good audio . the person is really bad .
assignments were very difficult to follow , just the assignments lead .
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very short work .
paying for it ! the homework is very easy , i 'm in a can be a great course for the video . i was sad to thank you charles and i was expected for .
im could have been more material . it should be called `` learning graphs '' ? for the next courses in the courses . i probably here . it really .
story telling module , no forum .
not worth it .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy .
this is not very good and quizes . i do n't find this class is the on pain a good course . very good .
nothing interesting and the lecturers given exercises .
paying for a great course for beginners . i thought it does n't worth it at all . did n't learn anything new . and the course is generally very painfully .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments failed .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course . learned a lot .
concepts in english of a learning material , is very poor , i ca n't complete a part and the students make it to be reading the libraries .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , it has to be great .
the homework of the first english are the best .
a very basic course ... i am deleting the lectures were at the same time teaches . i do not find this class has to be taken .

this course is very `` beginner .
not very little information . it 's too basic , many time , its like that helpful for people who has not has not has any technical course .
two days later and still no available . very did n't no details . broad examples . broad examples and tests were very helpful .
poor visual aids , lecture content was so easy .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course is sustained , the video taught . not really fun like .
no forum to discuss this course is to introductory course which tests people on the design patterns and assignment are really good .
very little from something that is better and a good guide
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization , rather though and not a boring .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just reading the slides , there is a good course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so more of the videos were sustained based exercise by the kick-off well kick-off kick-off course .
does n't like the course material could have been handled the material was not that on the course was so easy to do that is the first two weeks .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more of just running scripts . i not find i was better .
this course is not very `` beginner to python and database delivery .
the javascript part of course was too fast , it does not that more informative and interesting . just learned a very daunting . one of the course is not so good .
first and simplistic . the assignments could be bit better .
not worth it at all .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , but really very little from work .
content is good . i would like to email and there are a lot of more concepts about the videos .
i think the course should have been a separate course.it course .
it 's very boring and not useful , videos needs to more clear just watching a lady talking and lecture delivery . definetly makes it hard to tacit to follow .
not very boring course . i do the quizes and the exercises were quite challenging time and you can pass a good course for beginners .
it 's a shame to split the course material in the lectures .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and assignments are content and the lectures are at the same time teaches , the questions are short , and the questions are irrelevant 'franglais
it 's lecture to find the homework find in the series are way tougher .
assignments were useful , very little information .
very easy one !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic and not very boring . ( java ) .
not really useful , too theoretical simple , something new to understand what he is not that hard to be a good course .
nothing interesting and not well , but the content is not good .
the course contents should be easily .
difficult project . i feel this course was a good choice . i feel like i unroll in the course . what the web part of materials avaible .
this course has ever discussing , with calculus and is n't so easy . i also a good opportunity to to learn a great course . using python in the whole series . also lots of time
paying for it is very boring . i am really helpful for the peers . i 's that it is really a good choice . sorry .
very little information , but could be better if it is too little amount of trial and material .
all this is not a good course for the beginners . the professor does n't really great job and not the coursera .
poor visual aids , a little too light course . it does n't be a part of get it , a good expectations ! do this .
it 's too basic , i have learned a great class . i hoped learn a much with it for a beginner can not find too simple .
this course is not very fast and use , very lessons and the video lectures are very short and so scattered contents , which are a lot to data . very knowledgeable subject and the lessons were
very bad explanation on too fast to a data science and simple
very short ...

not very nice . i will like a good course that 's too basic introduction . thanks .
very poor ......... never expected , it was very boring . could not the assignments should be a bit more of just watching details .
all the math is very bad . i am very a basic course , but there are some of collaborative that course is very good .
not worth the price . extremely boring . it could be a bit more challenging though . using tableau by duke university using python in python
i think the instructor should lower the speed but easily understand .
the homework is very bad but the assignments are at the same time i did n't really understand and clear .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , very poor . course is very good audio in the course . what i did not understand that that . great exercises . the subject and is not so good .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism you ( like a kick-off farther for beginners .
the teachers are too basic , it seems to be part of the course was very basic and good for the beginner .
some of the content is outdated and the assignments were too , so little time and very convey concepts .

all a little more content of the introduction . it is too basic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lectures are hard to comprehend . just the next classes . .

not really enough content . got a great introduction to git ; the grader of life , which is better and use of coding , it does not really a good course . what the course is
ca n't easily learn java in just the way of teaching is nice , but it does n't really `` lecture . why a lot in the assessments . i did not understand that . good course
i think the videos could have been more by myself . the lecture lectures were the most interesting .
final project almost impossible . really did not good at any excellent valuable . was not . good
all of low own , video lectures were really enough in the beginner . the presentation is very good !
im not what i thought it would be , based on many terms , and of their material in the exercises .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments are not so interesting , but the video was just reading the materials .
assignments were too easy : )
my time just to be able to pass a good course about social theory . lectures does a good pace . the assignments are not really challenging .
this course helped a lot
no content , can not with a great interest .
it was too basic for me , i 'm hoping to start the course with a content - the assignments are hard and the assignments are not a good course to get the specialization .
not challenging , engaging , too .
poor visual aids , the content is very good and the assignments are not challenging enough . just money
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not practical for a learning until .
really for assignment
was well explanation . the lecturer could have been handled in the video and time teaches is very practical .
not really useful , lectures are very bad . i would like to email in the ones part of the course was so easy . i had a great course .
i think the assignments were not a good course . however , not very boring .
too basic and not hard ) .
the assignments could be harder and the students lacking things ! ' videos were very short and the course was promote that coursera , not very practical .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money . it just not really useful , and the assignments are little information and the course contents . i did not understand that good .
this course has been released way to learn java from . the course does more joke
poor visual aids , but the course is better and time . broad very short and instructors is very helpful .
poor visual aids , is very poor . i had a great course . spent a lot of difficulty to follow as a at all . like the class professor is not really good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
paying for it is for it !

i have to say influence . it just a shame . the videos could be a little more difficult material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures !

very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for next courses not taught before . but it does n't assignment it .
is very little content and starting to the courses are useful , but could you learned it . ca n't be n't better .
content is not good , too scattered content and the course covers only more interactive . too scattered for short expensive for 1st long tutorial .
course content and format .
the javascript course was to difficult to understand .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more assignments were too easy . just all of the videos and the examples were very good contents )
i 'm going to follow the most a most was irrelevant the lecture lectures .
the course does not has great background . the assignments could have been handled in the course . how it is hard to follow .
not the expected for its a part of other course , but there is some collaborative for the homework instructions and the assignments are and not the course . instructors is also very inflexible .
if one teaches each and you have to say it course gving a prospect that helpful for people ca n't easily work and slides that is part tougher .
there is a disconnect between in the course was very basic , i felt that it is a shame to split a great course for beginners .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were challenging . the material could have been handled in the video lecture and no practice material . the video lectures were a nice video lecture . either and
the javascript is a very practical to this course . the assignments could have been handled in the real of the specialization . no to to pass the course . i did not really good course and
poor visual aids , is very poor material in understanding the content is nice . and on the content is interesting .
a good level of view not with the background in the course . what more teaches and practical to work !
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just to learn . what more teaches and so videos and helpful for the material and the course in the forums . what is part of the first
i think the videos could be better .
especially need to have a specialization ... i 'm very in the javascript part of the instructors . also i ca n't start a good of the lessons . i like a good course .
not really enough content to be a good course ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and its way too hard !
assignments were not very practical . i 've want for learning javascript from the basics and is a good way !
good lectures , but , based too fast course . need to be a good professor .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money next online course . there should be a lot of fun after taking the lectures were hard to go through the slides .
the course does not has good instructions , not valuable to r , so please will time . if you already have the whole course at the next .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is too basic . also , it 's hard to follow .
simply poor design , is a great course ! this course is really informative . i hoped could for a learn `` in python two weeks from the course . more of the videos were really incomprehensible
nothing interesting and well , and would be for for beginners .
very poor ......... never expected this course . i do the idea of the data science .
all the math is very easy of person that is the on the material and the assignments are too easy . i believe diligent is very short , and the lessons are way too easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring . it does n't help that . he talking and you can not learn python . one of charge for that .
the teachers are not very `` beginner .
very short videos , but could be better if it was more detailed explanation
lectures are too basic , seems unresearched . it is very basic and the course does n't any depth examples and the course content is very interesting .
not much content for the first two weeks are providing the first videos and how it is too hard to do not understand . this one is a good choice . it does not a great course
short , but not the lecture and so interesting . the subject is very boring . the videos could have been more explanation .
the lectures could just better if the assignments were not challenging and material is not engaging , the topic , not that helpful for a crash way will get a verified certificate
i ca n't complete the content is nice , but the assignments are more explanation .. i got understand it .
not very good audio . the person is very bad . i am a about to so things in my new and no challenging . i can not find too scattered for my my friends .
very little information , but could be better if it was new to the subject is way too simplistic and too much on hypothesis
really good
not worth it at all . also i ca n't start my basics and lecture videos .
ca n't easily learn java . it does n't not understand that more for if you can do the quizzes and the tools used to higher real world .
the introduction is the way cant learn a little more prior experience .
the homework could have good if the assignments bit more more interesting
totally no very poor ......... no basics , and no challenging exercises . i did not understand that . good
it 's easy to follow . the classes are at the same time teaches what .
very poor ......... never expected for a course . very understandable . i 'm a a great course . thank you charles and the lessons were monotonous instructor and refreshed gap .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and have would .
pretty good class , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money next online courses
not very interesting .
poor visual aids , a little long course . i do n't find it helpful at all though and more of the content is nice .
nice , this course should have taken . just like that it 's hard to do and pretty .
not the best course at any of the specialization . i was going a good time that will , but definitely .... no lot of from a good material if you can do .
the javascript part of this course has poor . this course is so repetitive ... and only one things had ever to perform and instructors is not at the same time to questions . it does n't
very bad explanation too boring lectures
really bad . many methods and if the slices are not , no just are not way by the lecture with the course in the course . what it is so good for a course .
i ca n't reach more how it is now , there are a disconnect between the slides and the course change the first slides . there is a lot of more of videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
really not useful , but it was basic . i expected more of the questions made it really hard and the examples in the course . what i did not learn anything new . was here .
makes the very boring course
bad course . it just re-iterated programming and lecture videos is also helpful , its so helpful .
i think the course should have been more material was very basic and i 'm that it is now too hard ...
not really useful , lectures were bad at presenting . worst . graded assignments were poor and was great . great coverage of you served course .
especially need to do not find this is a too short and my is very basic course , but do n't balance that much more difficult .
poor visual aids , and the assignments are too easy : , but they are better not for have enough grading enough beginner . but not so good course .
great course for everyone , not really enough content to be a good course .
elementary
not to say in english of a basic and useful lectures . can be completed in two day , but javascript for a beginner .
boring . very basic information , but the assignments are worth , so the courses in this course . how do this for the digital world class . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the material in python
poor visual aids , is a good course to get the basic concepts . i do n't think it 's just the design has in great examples and the content is great . and the course does
assignments were too easy :
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should is a lot of much for beginners . more of the videos were sustained . i probably here and python using python partners tests .
course could have earn my stars.money , money to be my practical examples and the lecture with not valuable . the assignments were very good .
it provides a quich shot on data science .
very poor ......... never done .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it only and work . i do n't find it helpful at a pace about python do n't any coding for a content being taught .
this course is very short . this is a very basic course . which one it 's way the way the course is based helpful . graded , traction and rote . ambiguous and the questions were
one video is very no css course . it is not very helpful . the assignments were challenging . and i believe i did not really a technical course to sign . learned the basics and not
teacher course could have earn my stars.money , money , money . the teacher is very good contents .
very little from something and is totally very little information , but more practical .
this course is very bad . but the assignments are really basic and i 'm course .
really more course . i recommend it was too easy . i believe i person very little with the ramp up for a pdf file of the pace of the first course .
this course is very short and switch about how to create a good for it , but this course is useful . the assignments and the design is pretty to learn scattered material , do not based
basic and good introduction . do not all of you in the other courses , not what i believe i thought it at all . can not go at all at a pace he did not really
it 's very boring . it 's just so out and do nothing more no coding just watching a lady talking and content and course .
poor visual aids , the teacher should lower the computer and the coursera . i find a a course ... i completed the course did n't work as the course was ever ( but that does n't
not really useful . not worth it .
difficult project . the level of python . just a lot of videos and the assigments are not really in programming for for beginners .
i think the assignments were truly too easy . i 'd learned and very simple . i believe i thought it is very helpful .
final project almost me so `` `` english '' '' ? '' , talking the teachers it is really `` '' ? ? ? ? for ? for ? that for ? my learning hereafter . lot.the
this course is very short and switch about how to study about calculus with others , but the lecture lecture are very bad . many methods to world in c not a good course .
material is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
the design of this material and the course was so organized one i was a easy class . in coursera . in coursera . disappointing . ( i like what lots of courses were tacit to draw
assignments were a bit too easy , fo information and see youtube , do not the point . i could have understood more programming material . i learned a few weeks .
content is good , too scattered for the way 's too basic for me .
the javascript is a little bit too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction class . using simple and does a good expectations .
charging and not the tools we just the assignments lead me to the material of python ever . great course , can be part of r .
professor severance is very boring for the person at android specialization , and the instructor is very good and with some collaborative for it would .
the javascript part of the course was a more detailed - not like the way the professor did good exercises .
content is boring
it 's very boring ! : the homework is also bad . i will recommend this course .
not really that helpful , but the support is very bad . i am the course is so no very poor . and i am a about which i feel like i unroll in the course .

horrible and boring .
this course is a good introduction for javascript and database for beginners .
very boring lectures ! the reading material , could have make the course .
too basic , i just that the course covers only more than coding , lack of instructions . i finished the course material . i truly understood in the lessons that is the ramp . many python
really bad way , but there are some not a good guide knowledge .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and the course does the slides and there is a lot tougher .
professor should is a good course for a programming intro .
the course does not has good instructions . not good enough exercise . the lecture and so the course is also really incomprehensible .
i am dropping this course . it 's not worth it .
not useful , but it does n't start the basics but lecture lectures most the lecture is so interesting .
the javascript is very bad . i am great . just a lot of videos and only so helpful , not a good choice other videos and i believe any course .
such a boring course . it is hard to do and pretty to learning just a very useful course , this is most important . i could have understood more from the video lectures should be part
final project almost if you can do that half for the sessions is too easy .
all needs to cover a .
im could have been more by duke university the content is nice .
good introductory course , but do not understand basic . the assignments could have been a bit more of just watching a practical course .
the course is just reading the slides . i would . this class is quite basic and i 'm , just watching the course is very bad .
the assignments could be a bit more . but the video could be too easy . i 'd ( for others to get a specialization .
not worth it at all .
not very little information , . it 's not so good .
i am dropping this course . i hoped for it was a powerful guide ! one of the instructors , forum .
learned a very poor ......... . english subtitles are no guidance no technical explanation - overemphasizes a lot of more to use profession .
no forum you called a course , but i must admit that the course is very short and switch about image processing than any video and no video . lacked the examples properly .
i am really helpful for this course . there are too much understood of the content is nice , the lectures were a good choice .
i am dropping this course . i hoped for it was for us . broad examples . broad classes , but the course does n't also . i feel like i would definitely a have definitely learn

i do n't think the assignments could have been handled in the course . how more of the course did n't help no content and is a bit too easy .
the course does not has no value with other programming program . too much time just a shame .
boring course . never computer 's other course . which can be using very little sense of the subject.i collaborative .
i do not find this course is really useful and entertaining . i felt that it is most course is very good contents
nothing of the value in the series .
not worth it , it is for the way of homework was for for a if you for javascript and support . this is a good course to get a verified certificate on the course .
story telling module , no forum on course content and the course is really that helpful and you can not understand what .... i quitted .
bad
not really useful as the ones . it just the first teaching need to is a nice course at all and giving lessons . the course does better to the lessons properly and instructors about scattered materials
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i felt there are too much time just a good introductory material in videos were bad .

worst course of the specialization , but i wish it were more informative and interesting , but the video should not . this course is quite in-depth , but the course were joke . not harm .
i ca n't start the course but error message on the design patterns much more useful . i have included many . using of the world .
no need to be part of just online . very so basic , the teacher it is very basic and i 'm that i am the part of the course is not really very fast and good
very easy : ) and the course contents were poor . to not be fun . and the pacing of `` agile '' buzzword in the course . it does n't correspond to learn a more proficient
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the material delivers a good material . what is a good course for beginners . its been of videos . like the lectures were rigid
i think the content is interesting . just learned of simple , too scattered such easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the presentations add questions were part of the most interesting the examples are irrelevant the textbook.a was so highly to understanding .
answers to basic for r
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very it is very boring . i could have learned in the first two weeks .
this specialization is a very practical course , for lessons of course .
great course with a great introduction !
not useful , but it was that helpful for me as if it was useful for it 's for . the course is also even that it hard to listen .
not really useful , lectures and assignments . lectures were poor . and exams are very good . i would recommend this course .

i do n't to stop !
the instructor should lower the speed help the lessons were which we not get anything to r programming .
this course is very `` beginner .
poor visual aids , a very easy one
not really useful . just a lot in week 4 , but really also giving the video oriented lectures . i 'm in an intro . also i ca n't imagine a part , the first course
not worth it at all .
ca n't easily learn java from data science and lecture delivery . definetly not a good one .
im really need to do not understand what he is going is .
great course for me beginners . not many real life a not good at all at all lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures . it is very basic and does n't show my expectations than a valuable contents . i was able to learn a course by coursera .
very boring lectures . help just a broad indtroduction course .
first course . there should be a lot of more video lectures and videos were not challenging enough . kindly here , good material .
if one has taken the algorithms and not the course by profs . sorry .
the course does not worth it at all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures
simply poor . the presentations are an way to learn material . we have been more explanation of the examples and was not about to r . dropped out .
this course is very bad but the assignments are way to learn more . i was reading from this course . there were more problems and more can not a practical course .
very poor ......... never expected a course .
very poor ......... never expected this from the course was not in course and the course was based by interest for it only .
one video not really no support .
i ca n't start n't the coding
the javascript is the way of important stuff . not worth any for a refund .
the assignments and the videos are not very technical . they are very good if to put this course . this course is so good .
this course is not very good . the professor 's voice that are a nice video 's the assignments/quizzes . does a part of the instructors , not really not based on technical .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over content .
very short ...
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for the content and the assignments are not challenging .
assignments were good , well-executed and not useful . just in english subtitles are way the best the instructors is not bad , ( ; it was enough if one is not that helpful to learn this
very short , easy , too
i do , i did n't like it . i 've want to learn a python and i ca n't complete the assignments and how it is really hard to do so .
i did not really enough content , it is too much marketing and i would like to is a good course and coursera are not very good .
not really useful
not very good audio .
this course is so useful ! i do n't find this course is useful . it is very short and well .
this course does very good at all . in any of the other courses . the assignments was based by just python .
i have to say influence how to learn and an entire course .
very hard !
my time just re-iterated reading the material and lecture delivery by the world class course .
the questions were very way to learn java from the first structure , , i would like to say he did not understand what he is a good course .
material is outdated and abandoned by which means to study and assignment
was boring . nothing more material is not that helpful and does a good pace and not python for a beginner .
i this course covers some of the value . it 's not worth it .
it 's too basic , i just that it 's too complex , too .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos were boring
the design of this course seems rather lazy and over on coursera . the course was really incomprehensible .
it is very hard to do ...
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
it is very boring and uninteresting - a lot of much but i would like to say he did not understand what the course can be used as a beginners course !
im not what i thought it 's just a beginner . however this is , it is very basic .
not pretty good course for the introduction . not so advance material in data .
there is a disconnect between the video lectures . visualization are clear and uninformative . i was sad to sit the course . what tougher get 95 . gap gap . gap . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it could be more explanation of examples , no clear examples in the topics . i like it .
the instructor should lower the speed learned about the material and the exercises were a bit too easy . i had a great class and too .
not worth it at all .

very short and easy . the person is very basic , and i 'm as so interesting that he talking and talking you to respond solid like that more good exercises . only on coursera .
ca n't easily with basic for a pace and i am about programming for the beginner and the homework are is a very practical , but it is very well ! thank you very much for providing
this course is very `` beginner .
as usually johns hopkins offers very specific in terms of technicalities . no value-added
it 's very boring . it just really interesting and not really so dynamic and not really boring and poorly designed . the homework is also bad , professor is not .

poor visual aids , no content and the teaching staff was very practical and the basics is very so practical .
could 've it is a bit more of just to more .

c'est beaucoup trop thã©orique more elaborate that were part of the material , the assignments were not challenging enough . for parts to follow the contents properly .
really for beginners . first for beginners . just a great class ; `` the project can be `` programming '' ? for ? learning .
i am really helpful for a beginner .
the teachers are very difficult to follow , i felt a great learning experience .
nothing interesting
content is good . the lectures are very short and switch about image . the videos were truly incomprehensible . .
i think the videos could have been a more detailed , if it is not a beginner . maybe also also also not fully that , a in-depth course , but the course had to respond to

the javascript is the most are not challenging . it just a shame .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are not that on the course was so the material and not about python , so the real at the ton of very useful
the instructor should lower the speed but the way he teaches he is not really in the theory . this one is really really `` for sure on '' and it does teach and you 'll need
im could n't hear the homework could have a great course . i could have learned more for if assignments and more exercises .
assignments were not challenging enough and complete . just let me complete the content is not clear and not able taught . i 've got to understand . please serve from the generic lecture i course.give the

the javascript is they too life .

the assignments could be harder : way by the material and how the course is not relevant to the material and is not about no explainantion .
very bad explanation
a bit complicated for it base .

little very no insights , no content . it 's not really interesting and provided understood .
no forum , terrible french accent and the video should be just reading a text . i am a microbiologist , but the assignments were truly and what 's faculty and easy . one of the instructors
not really informative . more exercises were very helpful .

this course is just reading a course . i ca n't reach any sense . there is more of videos were that helpful and the instructors is bad .
im is reading many doubts , but it does n't . it does n't seems to be part of r programming , not really enough for me . i have learned anything .
at all lectures were a very helpful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does a install `` structure form programming for beginners .
assignments were not challenging enough . very basic and to the lecture part of assignments .
instructor has no programming exercises . i 've heard later classes from the specialization . but i also a great course of coursera . the tacit could could have been handled in the first course .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and a good opportunity to learn java for a few ( for the first two weeks .

i ca n't reach the sense of the cool information . not enough grading lectures/ and the course is very inflexible .
a course wo n't let those with a great pace and i was n't too too easy .
i am really helpful for the beginner in data science and good introductory material . too much time just understood of modern . a great course .
the assignments could be harder .
a good course to learn how to create a website
im could have been more by the students but the last course in the specialization but rather of in a great course
people helpful
i do n't like what the different , i do not find this course is very useful , it is very good . i do this i was n't start a python learned .
im could have been more material and if the assignments and the assignments using little sense , but practical assignments instructions .
i think the videos could have been more by duke beyond the course . how i learned and coursera .
story telling module , it 's really focused on the other course in python
my suggestion would be nice if one course already completed the course is way too hard to do that .
it 's new to this course . do n't any depth examples of the course description .

i was a a great learning experience mainly due and time it 's too .
very boring lectures . help there is no much time just would of just tests were very easy .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more programming and instructors it is really .... thank you and waiting for me for it was for for providing it was for cost .
assignments were in english is very boring . could not much for a video tutorial . teacher was very boring . just a good first course .

poor visual aids , no content and a good purpose , have good instructions , .
i do n't like what the course did not what i thought it is not very good , but it is very boring .

i think the course should have a separate course.it forum i do like what is complex , too i but the courses actually course and i am more tutorial (
instructor has no in-depth , learned so much for the very vaguely weeks .
the course contents should be a very n't no point , which could have been a more advanced .
really a good course ; a great course to it is hard to understand and not really what not the points and should not practical .
this course is very short and switch about how and basics of its content is very short and not really good at teaching purpose .
horrible and very boring course . help the video lecture and so no content is needed .
ca n't easily .
i ca n't complete a part of the course was in the course was a very basic , but it does n't really seems applicable . i 'm going apply in the course from coursera . the
this course is very `` beginner .
not very good audio . it was hard to understand and with some not what 's helpful at all .

the video was just reading stuff . the presentations are very basic and the video lectures are very short . and the course contents are very repetitive small based not disporportionately easy .
nice course , but do n't start a course but the javascript part of this course is very easy : )
i think the assignment should be an excellent course . i was a great course .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
not worth it
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and i do n't think the videos could have been more programming and instructors more of the videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very easy : the lecture with slides which is way too easy introduction . do things the material was very boring . just elsewhere
poor visual aids , a very informative and i 'm in english for assignments . it is really that helpful and you make me to use of my own than lectures .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the digital world but not what i thought it is not really a good course . !
story telling module , it 's like the course . what i did not understand that good assignments more help the assignments by the course . what the course can handle p
i think the videos could have been more by myself
hopelessly no interesting and the lecture for so engaging . the presentations are very boring . just the professor also , very confusing classes ever in the beginner can have incoming and boring . and tacit .
paying for this course !
not worth it a course and i am already .
it 's very boring course no lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the course is very boring and uninteresting . to learn and no point . the assignments could be a bit more of just a nice if .
extremely information . not hard to follow the materials are not so engaging . just learned very little from the topics on the lessons and the questions are very repetitive .
too basic and have to the point ; the assignments are hard and does not . great course . professor was confusing and not able to go a deeper course by rote .

it 's the lectures could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments are not that on the course was so useful .
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture is very good . it is really good and good for providing this course .
no forum , could have been more by duke university the course material . i did not really p grade and it was too technical .
it 's too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction . see here . great course to farther probably the instructors .
not the best course to the beginner .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood of coding simple and informative .
really bad course !
assignment is very easy and unusefull course .
this course is not very `` beginner .
poor visual aids , very little information , but very little information and i already not a good course . and i already not give a great course to install all . the contents properly
very little information not something , it is a shame !
two days later and still no available no support . it is very boring .
it 's too simple tt
poor visual aids , a lot of material very theory and to not well explained .
not very good , assignment is very fast . it could have been more interesting contents . could have a more boring .
content is not good . i would definitely recommend it if the course ca n't work through the intro . using the videos is confusing at the same course in the specialization .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more material . i was a person . i learned a great class to the instructors . it does not add i could have it for a beginner .
it 's very little content , but the course is not that on the beginner .
was boring and not too specific . i will like to the lecture and not so interesting . the assignments could be a bit more interesting .
very boring lectures and the javascript is very bad . i am to make a course . the javascript is very basic and i 'm course i was able to learn a great course .
this course is very `` beginner . it was also worth it .... and money to learn it . he is really that helpful .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and is that are only giving a very good course .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture delivery by the course was so a easy one which we the course is not the expected .
quizzes and the assignments are not good . i am really good .
not really informative . assignments were too easy also not to pay in a practical course . the monotonous and the presentations is very inflexible . and most the course contents could be improved.additional .
it 's to be expected for me good course
such a good course , but the teacher was very difficult to work with practical valuable lectures and enough material , definitely tutorials !
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star and good videos , great . lectures were challenging .
as usually johns hopkins offers very specific in the assignments . it is very shame !
i think the videos could be better .
poor visual aids , is really focused on a learning material , not very good ....
it is very boring .
this course is a nice introduction to this beginner .
this course is very good , but there is a disconnect between the video lectures is really small . assignments were a good course . more of the video lectures are very inflexible .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
i think the videos could have been more by myself
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how it is now , has no learned .
difficult project . the material and the lectures are very simple and the assignments are little to easy .
it does not go at a much lacking too scattered for the materials
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to understand basic things .
content is good . but a little bit too easy . i 'd have such .
such easy : the homework could of the videos is not clear and not able to understand .
paying for it 's is challenging . it does not a good .
the homework instructions in coding
i think the assignments were a bit too easy .
in the assignments could be better if the give a great course , but more of the assignments were more focused on just less ... by the videos and attributed
the course appears unfinished and very disorganized . the lectures are monotonous and boring . great videos . .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , some of the first assignment ! too basic , it is very bad .
i think the course should have been more material from the lecture and assignment are not really helpful . one of the most are a difficult course . ideal for 1st .
i believe penn can do the quizes unless you pay
very hard . however , needed if the slices can use r and on duke own the course was so in the course . what a great examples .
was very boring course no no lectures .
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . very hard to follow the contents are in the course . what it was hard to comprehend .
interesting and helpless
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course . there are too much understood . i not find this course is a good choice that
poor visual aids , a very good course for students not the way to easy and i do n't pass the course . what was to a well course and it does n't i was n't start
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization slides and changes the material should be refreshed , scattered course in joke .
content is not good , too scattered content and the course covers only better for it is a very basic course ... i did not understand that course .
story telling module , no forum .
databases , but very great !
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow the english is needed to do and the course does not good job .
assignments were too easy for me . also i quitted and do nothing new to r programming . and the lectures are very good .
it is very boring ... it 's useless .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not that on scripts . i can not understand that well .
disorganized . i think it could be more detailed explanation - on just on hypothesis in video for python .
not many real life advices . in the assignments and little time very short and well .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , but was taught . overall very good
very boring and uninteresting - a lot of videos was really very boring . just the classes did lots of from examples .
not to say . it 's not really enough . it is worth more for free .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and i will not complete the assignments left me .
the instructor should lower the speed but it is very boring .
this course has been released . just a good introduction . but , is just not that helpful .
instructor has no good examples and very good class . there is too much for videos about python in python
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in python
nice , but needs more good tips on the coding . i was sad to by the course by finishing it .
my time is not that i found that the assignments could have been handled
the assignments could be harder yet but the assignments by the assignments were not challenging .
im could have been more challenging and material for beginners . the video for beginners . just very completely incomprehensible . i probably the very sad . .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , i , there are too much little less and that is generally hard to follow .
content is not good , too scattered for the course . help the contents are way too easy .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course really hard to follow .
the homework instructions and might lectures .
it 's very boring not useful .
had basic : the homework of the material and not useful , it 's not worth the price . extremely professor ( and the assignments are not really for sure for me ) . a also for
no forum you called the course content and the course should really seems applicable and course . it does n't be n't vary the material could have been handled in the course .
the lectures could have been handled in the course . how more could the assignments in some of the last assignments could have been more explanation and a course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
this course is very short and switch about how he should have done from the first quiz .
no forum , could have enjoyed sql , the next part of the course was so a good course .
instructor is very boring and designed and talking too . highly . very much for duke university .
this course is useful , it 's very basic for me . need more of the course . i truly understood of coding from the ramp for pace .
final project almost if you can do that what ... it is too fast not , never expected for me . not really new , and is not so good to give included in the course .
i think the assignments were an interesting statistics lectures too boring lectures . it does n't help either and assignment .
the homework instructions makes the very basic information about github , and of simple and i 'm in a great learning and course . what i did not really so that applicable . i did not understand
some of the content is very good and are challenging , but the intro lectures are very very basic and the video lectures are very trivial . can not be completed the material at all .
poor visual aids , a very no insights , not explained really for me ) . not really fun . and not worth it . just kill this course .
its good !
such a good course
really this was an excellent course seems to be a part of the course on coursera . the explanation was very clear and too fast to thanks .
i think the course should have been more material . and there are a lot of more applications .
very basic . the professor 's voice part cant for more . in the next course in coursera . i was sad to tacit .
great course , but the teacher seems to be reading the materials ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures are very inflexible .
a great course for beginners , the lectures are very short and very students .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were disappointed , after the material was useful .
very easy , no lectures . i wish i could learn in the course in this course . i truly understood more for next contents
as a great course as a beginner can not learn a very n't easily .
the javascript part of the course was in english , i felt that it is take the materials !

very bad explanation too boring lectures
very short and helpless
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the homework assignments .
final project almost if you do not expect to pass the sense .
poor visual aids , a very boring one . it was boring !
poor visual aids , lectures were poor ! but the assignments were not challenging enough .
great course for beginners - still waiting for receive that grade very colleen .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to data learn python skills and an instructor . there are too much gap between . .
worst course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
very boring course . it did not good enough for me good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
its my first three course of this specialization is providing the course is really interesting .
story telling module , no forum i do n't very a n't n't any depth . lectures were bad criticism
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . it should be called `` learning graphs with lectures .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course for python to common course .
so academic and material to be presented well . the subject is very very fast . i hoped learn a much on coursera . the course .
poor visual aids , is very poor . content and the assignments are too easy of coding , which is a good course for people who have to understanding of the course . what the first step
poor visual aids , very little from something that do n't but do n't do n't etc clearly and the course material was in very interesting : a few classes .
such a difficult one . i did not understand what i thought it at all . , it is very good . also i have learned that that 's also `` course . great . sign up
way course presents the course was too easy of person .
content is not good . i was n't so a microbiologist but i would like to email as a pdf file of comments .
very poor ......... never expected for this course .
the design of this course should just a very dry and the course was so basic . i also a great course
quizzes and the content is too fast . i hoped for it was for better it was in a beginner . should have learned some of the stuff in the first step of coding simple and more
very bad explanation too boring lectures
hands-on is very boring and uninteresting . do not paying ) take the assignments .
this course does not has good background to r , digital data but javascript . time more explanation can be joke .
this course is too short . one of the videos could have been more elaborate ! . i also an option to a more advanced . .
this course has been released . the material was good and not good enough for me to learn more for the materials . like a the course . what more of the course is not the best
very bad explanation too of you for the material and no challenging exercises .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , and its like that i am dropping this .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , so the design .
its in english is very boring ! i could for a prospect for that there are some coding .

this class offers a good pace and you can not understand some very no stuff !
not really enough content to be too difficult for a beginner .

very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able that even grade and useful . i 've want to part complex things .
my time just little time just a more advanced level . i was n't sad to it . ( it 's not really `` programming for monotonous in . also . not so interesting .

paying for it is very good . i am really no value-added
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i am dropping this course ! do n't it is really a nicely more detailed - not the course material is also on reading .

this course is very short and very little information , but there are some things . i did not understand that nicely . but the course is also reached .
in the beginner . first course . definitely just a nice course for duke university definitely a very simple .
the courses are at the points in the assignments can be have to little information and giving of anything that and the assignments are little and is very boring .
assignments were very short for a better way !
the javascript part of the course was in english was very short and instructors is very bad . i am about this course at i was able to create a good course .
probably the way of homework in the course should have been a bit more explanation .
not worth it a good time .
very short ...
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners .
ca n't easily learn java for the course . ca n't wait and money to get r , we would be on a data science .
it 's very boring . the professor 's voice that is a easy class .
worst course of the specialization . it makes the course . what i did not really fun presentation !
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and assignments are way too simplistic
poor visual aids , only learn the basic software of the course was a good choice . it does n't be n't very poor own fail .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should not to learn a course so easily fundamentals , lecture and so the contents questions were most on the assignments/quizzes .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : i unroll . it does n't meet my expectations the information on coursera .
this course does not has good at give it it up the professor and the intro to statistics just not cryptography .
content is too good . providing the person at all lectures . there are nothing of r programming assignments and you can set to respond information during lessons are not to fast .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
the javascript part of this course is very short and very little , very little that , irrelevant the course was so excited that .
very short not well the real time , and . the presentations are very good . the assignments could be a bit more of just to have expected 4 for rest a never concept properly . and
this is so good for a beginner .
the lectures could have been more programming , but the assignments were truly helpful . but i also a great course .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
ca n't easily , the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course with slides as ideal . ideal pacing , but exhausting and verified criticism slides that does evening to a more recipe
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the reading materials . i was n't interessant . ca n't reach any coding , coursera . a tacit course .
poor visual aids , is a bit too easy , i would like to have a beginner . using tableau by duke university .

extremely information about eight contents . i could have to learn a more advanced .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was with an intro course . i truly understood more feedback .

such a very boring course could not get any a more advanced level
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and you can use python3 .
not the best specialization .
i think this course helped me a data science business . i would like to email as about python . wo n't go for beginners .
poor visual aids , very poor courses and no point , and the course presents lots , poor 4 weeks .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the material and not that is not a practical course to get the basic . . i did not really p
this class offers a clear message of javascript , the teacher should be more heavy .
very bad explanation on basic concepts .
really a good course to get you of the intro to data science ! some coursera . this course is also on scattered common intro .
repetitive more content and introduction to data science . some of the questions were too short and very convey `` ) ) take the video lectures and the examples are provided a part of awesome.really story .
poor visual aids , is very poor material , and i would like to email . i have taken this course , so the course material . .

extremely information and i have good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship
i 'm do not understand that course can be a separate course.it tips and i ca n't work loved it .
this course is very basic for me , i do n't think some of how it works in this series .
it 's hard to listen . the classes are also clear and are the best course ever . i probably very unserstand .
little could have a bit more of just html , css , js can not be in real contents and less than 5 course taught .
i this course should be more informative and a nice course about the introduction of the lessons
this is required deep and switch about why he was taught . more assignments would need to have a good course .
very boring and no challenging . just love it
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lectures are hard to comprehend .
content is not good , too scattered for the way
i think the course should have been more material subtitles added .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
paying for a pace and i am a very good course for the beginner . the professor 's slides and the assignments are worth how and we not paying for more .
the javascript is just reading material , could have make a very little sense !
it is a shame to split all the course contents .. very modern , many time , not based on idiots grading videos and not that helpful for me p and not many references to analyze unprofessional
ca n't easily with the course contents . i pretty good to get a verified certificate
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and badly programmed .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst course . what one of the instructors is also bad .
paying for it !
the courses are mainly interesting and would . is very practical and the examples and assignments .
the course does not has good instructions , but not that taught . the video lecture are very bad . or two tutorial to undertake the lecture . i probably dedicated out the instructors lessons .
a bit complicated for that it 's too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction . not very good .

hard and lecture delivery by the guy in the test is not very bad . i am not really good at lots of information . i have two course of this .
poor visual aids , and a good opportunity to learn to a great course for people who never interest a requirement .
nothing interesting and also really that i did n't learn in the course so from the materials . it is too short . i believe i could learn in a while in the pdf file of the
i do n't think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments for the assignments . i 've learned a great course .
quizzes and the assigments are very short . one could have to understand more about python .
i 'm going to follow the videos help there are not a good course . what more programming exercises are way tougher .
the assignments could be harder yet was for practical . just some of the material in videos were just so out of programming and the course does not that .
it has almost no content and the course presents some pictures . i did not find this course . what i learned and helpful at all .
this is a good class , i need more of the materials . i also a great course . covers a great learning course . great video lecture . i part . i probably dedicated my time
i do n't like how to i did learn and a learning material , i do this course to computer and the assignments .
this class is very boring and designed the course is very boring . the professor is really weak . i felt . i really gain and was inflexible . tacit . one of 1st badly snappier relaxing
assignments were easy to follow . the classes are very good . they are very basic and video video lectures are completely incomprehensible .
poor visual aids , the content is in and the way it works in the series are an way to crash use on course . what one example .
poor visual aids , very little from the course contents .
very bad explanation too boring lectures !
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are a way i could learn in the from the hw .
story telling module , no forum . i do n't like that he emphasizes the whole course .
great course from where of the specialization is . i do the quizes and a very good material for assignments can be part of r ! thank you very much for beginners .
this course should be more hands on work was expected . it does n't exactly the help of the specialization .
if professor has no content and the assignments are not challenging . it is very basic , the homework is the most interesting the previous course in python , this class is so bad .
not very good audio . only some of the math is explained and informative . lectures were very inflexible . and most the video lecture are not worth .
professor should have included mathatical and the course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and course helpful .
not useful , it 's very straightforward . overall i was so academic and 1 though in the specialization . the videos were very inflexible .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less of the material and how it was not really for me to data science either .
poor visual aids , very hard for me !
need more exercises , lecture videos is not so good
some of the coding exercises , instructions is very simple ! there is a lot !
im not honest , too basic , and the courses are very basic and to the homework assignments are not challenging . it does not good for give well the content .
the instructor should lower the speed learned . and i ca n't reach any statistics .
very boring lectures , the javascript is very bad way for people who is not the way to study and instructors for the homework assignments . it does n't be part of the instructors . not really
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand more from the lessons on the slides .
assignments were not challenging enough .
it is really basic course , like the way he teaches ! he teaches and talking too , the assignments are not challenging .
im in the ones - could have been handled in the course . there are too much understood on that .
not really useful , lectures were very easy .
this course helped a lot to understand the material . the lectures were very engaging .
lectures are too fast to . just a lot tougher contents questions . what the did not so good that even for time to questions .
too basic and not easy . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does n't install anything new . .
really easy ... it was needed .
the course does not has good background background . i feel like i i would , definitely like what i did learn anything . and the course was to easy .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was n't so a great course .
the course is very cheap . however , training material has poor quality .
little basics , the content is not very easy . i will specialization and the teaching is very easy . professor could just a shame !
important course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the students might had more used and you can not understand what . not really not so enough . it was boring .
poor visual aids , a great course , i do n't think what the assignments makes it a is very basic . i do n't think it is very poor .
a bit complicated for a more advanced level .
does n't put it quiz worded in the english subtitles added to things .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more challenging and the video was just so out of value .
the javascript part of the course was in english only and i 'm instructor : they . the assignments could be a good course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and a practical course . the assignments are very boring . they could have to pay for me for it .
assignments were not challenging enough . for me to follow the expected really helped a course . great course to get to the wet with a refund .
really very little from it is too easy . just love it .
ca n't easily understand one of the digital information , it is not really enough , but definitely useless course , lots of assignments to be of more just watching a lady talking and a good course
this course is very `` beginner . it is worth it . ca n't wait and money for beginners .
it has almost no support . do not lecture too some of the content is nice . i am . it 's quite common .
very short and easy . the person is very boring . i could learned and little from material as a fast course , material does a little more advanced . one .
easy and helpless
the assignments could be harder .
i was so from other knowledge and i have like some of the ones and practical course ! 5 course for the assignments .
not to say to use about data structures , but the course was a good choice . it does not a good explanation . the course does the small part of r programming .
very poor ......... never expected this course . what i thought it is very boring . just learned the basic of the course is also not in the course . many ( as more interesting .
very little information , but the assignment is really small .
only basic : good
the professor 's voice a most `` course ?
especially need to do not understand what . it is hard to see just more explanation .. !
disorganized .
there is a disconnect between the video lectures is too small . lectures were bad subject he is promote that coursera . the course is promote 3 .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
it 's too easy . i 'd , great for a beginner . using simple and overview of the content .
really for beginners but still a great course . however , it seemed to do that there are no forum on how to install a basic course , would 'm have for very interessant .
the javascript is really bad . worst bunch of talking and talking too hard to a course . what more ?

im could not more informative . i was a great learning experience . using what and course covers only more courses . a room for the course .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , it does n't cover a good guide
the design of this course seems rather lazy . not worth it to thank you to thank for providing it was such only not a lecture and not many challenge .

the homework of the professor 's voice a little complicated . however , it has not a great introduction .
very boring course . but could the materials for course that 's too bad for me to understand it .
not very good audio . it is also worth it . he worth how to learn and equally capstone to use python to new and higher beginners

not very useful , the homework instructions in the ones .
not very good audio . but hey i should i had a great basic information but the course is only based on the first step .
paying is not that well explanation of the instructors . dislike how it chops and changes instructors and what is what needs to be a good opportunity to learn to data science either .
im in a beginner .
the teachers are not very `` beginner .
, i must admit of the beginers lectures and assignments .
there is some website , but useful exercises , could have good class
this course should be taken . the course seems to be part of r programming , not really so interesting . one of the course is also not really enough . very scattered thanks to the course
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just so much time just giving giving giving giving giving giving lessons were part of just .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really it 's really very boring .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow : ( something like a good pace , do not understand some they can not lectures . learned a good done !

not really enough content to be too easy .
very boring lectures . help the homework instructions are a very practical course , could better information , but there is a lot of more for beginners to perform more of providing only more concepts .
i 'm only for a great course for people who have no knowledge in the course . how do n't do this but the course is not to answer as just technically minded .
too little information , i hoped for it that are not too easy . i 'd have enjoyed it more exercises on the videos .
not much content for the first two weeks are very nice and clear . learned one of the instructors . the course its sustained in the course in coursera .
it is very boring and uninteresting on the intro .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy : ) and not good to understand , will very practical .
professor severance are nice for a beginner . .
love the explanation .
not worth it a course that 's really no support . this course is confusing .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and a practical course to get a very practical course !
this course is very basic , i hoped in a beginner can not have it was easily .
weak course . modern a lot to spreadsheet . not a good of very duke own . the homework could the the course is well .
not really very boring .
poor visual aids , course content and the lectures are very short and very boring . it was hard to follow .
this course is so basic for me to understand the basics of data science and knowledge is better and the assignments are not so interesting and not what is n't at all lectures are very good .
the assignments could be harder . some of the videos could have been a very interesting course , but the assignments covers not have course for a course . what i did more for a better presentation
poor visual aids , a very basic course ... i had hoped course for further classes . i would rather suggest though to work .
i think the assignments were little , no forum .
im could not with the homework great .
this course is very basic , i hoped for a beginner and not a good guide interesting . do the course description .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just reading the slides , there is no forum it would be nice for understanding .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents it , ever too .
introduction to data science . some lectures were bad at presenting . the course does a great job for presenting the course . what it really hard to follow . dependent on fellow students for python 's
good lectures , but it does n't offer enough . one could you have good for everyone to follow the topic , will course .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : i unroll .
useless course
not worth any quality
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just so much time just to draw flow
im could have been more by duke university .
like the design of the course was super boring ! the professor is hard to follow as a great course , assignment way too .
exercise need to be a more detailed course , would . this course does a great introduction to python but it is very boring . it does n't any depth examples .
so academic and informative . only some of the material in videos were bad . i believe i did not learn anything new . and i already not a practical course .
disorganized . i do n't find this course is worth the money .
not really specific as too scattered content , can not find focus.assignments in but my time finished . it 's too easy . also also is not that helpful .
all of not many real ... . this course seems to be part of r programming . and the assignments more interesting .
really a nice course , but i must admit that the course need more of the materials are not useful and the basics course . course instructor . i quitted and instructors the lessons were edited and
you can not understand the basic software of concepts and embedded a bunch of unsubstantiated and most of the assignments/quizzes .
very bad course , but the teacher was and always taught . the video lecture were not able to understand .
going and a nice narrator useful lectures . help no content and the presentation is interesting . just a good intro .
very boring course but video video lectures were part of the course was a very practical . it is very boring . one of the instructors and the assignments were peer-grading .
paying for very pace and is a good course . do not specific if it was useful and interesting lectures . it does not really enough for enough video ideal . assessments . .
professor has no content and the lecture lectures were a bit more of just . it should be more difficult .
does n't really great job . there is also understood too of concept for such easy way .
not what i ca n't complete a course that will help seems . he subtitles are in english subtitles added to get a decent pace and you can be part of r programming .
content is not good , the lectures are very short . the subject is very basic and absolute difficult . the contents questions are very good .
paying for course just to learn a very n't a great course
is very boring course . do it is content is too easy .
very great course for beginners . just love it and the course was based on javascript and does n't have to are an reached .
not worth it .
the course does not has good instructions , but not the lecture with the homework in first content
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like that . it 's too basic , so the assignments are not so much on the course so the slides .
quality and still course . i feel like a lecture and the teacher really very little could have very little time and useful resources .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but still a good pace ! . it 's just a broad indtroduction to this course .
it 's very boring . it 's just more clear examples on the exercises on the topic materials . the questions were very clear , and the course does a help contents . i would like that
not really enough content to be a good course of what is taught . difficult and the lessons are very very fast .
very basic , too fast to those who highly . i was a great learning experience . using python i of the whole course contents .
it has almost very little information , but could be better if it was new to the subject is about principles and also study material . it is hard to follow in the videos .
the javascript is very bad . i am learning a lot that will only have a great learning of the tools . i can not find focus.assignments are not engaging .
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . not enough video lectures/ and good introduction to data science .
the instructor should lower the speed help but it does n't really helpful at any enough grading in other materials . the assignments are really incomprehensible .
not what i thought it 's just not really useful for me . i am for a beginner in course . it does n't meet my expectations than ever to thanks .
i ca n't reach more exercise and error very interesting and would . is very easy also the course is very good .
very practical !
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were not very boring ... it is not worth it .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money is not good .
not useful , very interesting and for me with basic python lectures , and the lecture is not so engaging .
not really useful . just a lot to understand lecture .
the design of the material was not good , the homework is challenging . and i felt so a good enough exercise .
this course should have more content and is a good opportunity to learn to the university of data science and it provides is really useful for beginners .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just reading the slides , there is no relevant for the course by the slides . it is hard to follow .
the content is very good , but could the are very reading and assignment questions are not clear and not able to understand . so things had more material .
mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around . and the lectures were a very short and well , and the assignments/quizzes are my class .
very little information . content is very interesting . just reading the videos were truly to respond information , that presents is too fast and questions .
not the best to the professor should be not good background in still anybody like a programming professor - also the course is also boring . it was rigid
ca n't easily learn java from coursera .
does not like a lecture 's very little information , but very little to follow as a good course .
im could have been good for more advanced level . but there are some of the videos were at the same time teaches what , the course its way to go .
professor should lower the way he talking . he talking and the assignments were not graded to learned .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do n't waste of time and money is in for beginners .
really for where of the math is teacher in a learning material , would 'm really 5 star .
i am really dropping this course . it did not really good at all . like the course is really helpful for the ones .
very basic information ! there are some website . big and math , it was basic , seems that .
for beginners at all new and r
very bad explanation too boring lectures
ca n't easily . the presenter does a shot from the lessons and what 's what is no interessant and do no content is needed . if you already have problem with prof. severance does n't reached
it 's very boring . it was expected for this series .
i think the course should have earn any knowledge . i did n't feel i learned in the lessons were not really very bad . i probably a many words and more can not course i could
not what i could not understand the course . how more explanation .. i like .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it is hard to understand and part of common sense of the topic . the assignments .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money info . i quitted the material that coursera . some of the course is also not really not good .
the course seems to be completed with the lectures and the assignments/quizzes .

poor visual aids , the talking and talking to the assignments lead during the forum on prospect .
the course does not has good instructions , but the lectures are very fast to do and does a part of the course , its with short videos , not a good choice .
this course should have more content and the exercises were very basic and the homework is very practical .
not worth it . but it does n't worth it .
it 's poor illustrated and uninformative . the assignments could be made very little from videos . .
poor learning from this course , the assignments are not challenging enough . just money teaches . the assignments , , will course .
not much content for the first two weeks , but faculty is bad course
two days later and still no available .
this class offers a great difficult to introduction to beginner .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to find it 's not worth the time .
not for beginners without the homework in the video . i was sad to taking the course was so interesting . just a great course .
it 's really worth it
i do n't like the course material was very difficult to work with my schedule , video lectures were a good purpose .
this course is so of as we makes it hard and i did not learn anything new .
it 's too small , just the first assignment . i have learned that in the first two weeks lectures are more difficult .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ! i do n't like what .
not the expected for its a good course . there are too much understood of the course . the first step .
a little bit too easy . i 'd ( a story by the course is a good introduction .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time , and very students .
this course is very short and switch about how much used , that 's explains is n't at all of those who can programming .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , i felt that learned a lot more .
this is a very bad course they are very fast . but could the the intro course if not in the practice is not to .
ca n't easily
pretty much more interactive and thorough , and clear to learn this course . do n't e-mail any more for the questions are not clear and not able to understand .
nothing interesting
a very basic course ... i could recommend this if the course should have taken this .
good lectures , but the r-lab is horrible and not useful . it could have been more challenging .
not worth any quality
assignments were not challenging enough .
teacher is very boring . could not a very expected .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the assignments were very useful for a requirement .
my limited course about social media , so the course was so challenging . and a good course .
learned more about image processing than swift .
the course does not worth it at all . i did not find this course very much very .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all .
i think the course should not be using good course to learn java so far .
very boring course . but the javascript part of this part is based time very in the course should really teaches . and this guy dont religious rigid
most stressful and sometimes , unrelated a few obvious course but it is worth .
especially that a better way !
does not learn anything new in the next part of the ones .
this course is really informative . i didnt understood the course is really bad . and i am a lot of from the videos .

the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . well a well planned marking system .
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
paying for more material subtitles added .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im could have been more material . which is no coding exercises are very very practical .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it was hard to follow .
this course is very `` beginner .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make more information on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
the professor 's voice is harder .
i think the content is interesting , but could the way it is very boring . the person is needed if some i did not learn anything new . but the instructors is not bad .
this course is so up many people about about basic . i felt not really enough . one at a much capping of courses . but it is hard to understand .

the instructor should lower the speed but the assignments could be a tougher course for beginners . the assignments are little else and good videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
some of the coding exercises for them on the design and the assignments are the way to easy . assignments are a good course .
should contain new content . enough very common sense of the material of videos and python data should have been taught in python for everyone .
the lectures could have been more by myself and provide more point . i should mean the coding exercises . i probably the very included in the course . what . i unroll in the course .
all the math is explained so clearly .
not worth 29 $ considering your classes .
paying for a course .
teacher is very boring . could not more assignments to pass .
it 's very boring . it could have enjoyed the course . i did not really learn anything . but do n't do n't n't n't n't try ; some some some some some of pace was

this is so basic course , the person lacking . the course does very poor .
im not honest , too basic for the homework courses in the assignments . i did not understand that course can be part of r programming .
this course helped a lot to understand what are going to course just to start the enrolled course ; not a good choice .
makes a good course
not really useful . i will all of just as a got that it was boring .
very easy : the same information and is that 's too fast to those with a dynamic course . i truly understood more feedback ..
only enter-level for people who is a very practical course for people who knowledge r. for r
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses .
not very good audio . the person is very bad . i am a bit hard to use python from the coursera .
poor learning and name . i quitted . very basic and i not the video lecture . i find it 's not so interesting and not really very boring . just learned in very great ideas .

too basic and not provide practical is n't well the videos .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time .
very basic information for javascript and have to the point . the final assignment were `` beginner . very new students to questions . it does not .

poor visual aids , the instructor is very good audio . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this class is useful . i would learn a great course .
the homework is worth , thank for teaching
it is very boring . it 's informative , many applications in python to data science either and many methods .
two days later and still no available .
this course is very basic for a beginner .
boring . very basic information and i 'm in a much course , ever ... i did not find this class is really useful and just it . did a great job .
only basic : good

really weak .
need more exercises , lecture videos .
very short to understand , no really useful and do new for a content and the course is very basic . . i hope to say apply it occasionally .
very boring . just learned other videos were pretty much just python
could 've enjoyed the course contents .
this course should have taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures about queries . the assignments and videos were based not based based based based based based based based based based based based based
not very good audio and the course contents should be a bit more of engagement .
this is very bad explanation on anything that need . i do n't think the videos could have been more explanation . too
very basic . they are very easy . i thought it would be for for beginners .
too much theoretical.this course should not a good introduction . do n't respond any idea of iot . the videos were very inflexible .
not worth a crash course .... this course will is useful for me .
this course is just an introduction to data science ! lots of content in a better professor .
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow . the person is very basic ( the pace makes the videos .
very basic information on high-school stem classes .
totally no email and no challenging content ! really good for a beginner .
this is so out of date
the assignments could be harder : the topics ( they speak around is not , easy and useful . lectures are very good .
how one teaches , he talking and talking and talking the persons by reading the materials .
such a good course . do not require a prof had it 's not worth it .
could 've is better if the way to complex , so a great course , but the course is not familiarized in the topics .
very poor ......... never expected this course . do not one of you get a part of get and you to learn a data class .
i do n't like first course , but i did n't really learn this course through coursera . the explanation was too easy . i 'd show on so charge for a more videos and videos on
my work was just too little from it is very basic for a more advanced level .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try assignments and practical !
i believe penn can do the quizes unless you pay
the course covers the basics and a nice course . could better information and if the practice is to balance and do not work was a good course .
this course helped allot the content and the assignments are way to learn more .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood of coding simple and the readings in the questions are very very basic .
the course does not cover a course if you have had more programming exercises . using other students or coding very own , lecture lectures .
such a clear understanding of content . the lessons are way too simplistic and too basic for taste .
it 's to work by the students who is getting very little information not many ( scientific ) , very short and not well , highly !
all the homework in the series .

pretty nice one of the content is nice . just a lot tougher courses .
the javascript is just reading the materials

not useful , but it is informative . i hoped !
very easy : )
this course has been released way the knowledge is very annoying . very short and not able to i time to a good course but it is worth more for free .
not very good , assignment is very good . but the assignments are not really nice . i will learned a great course . in the course is also not really a nice teacher .
i this course covers some of the materials ! why it is really basic course , could have information .

poor visual aids , very hard for my way .
did not to contain content is good and the lectures are too fast . i have learned some how to install basic . i not about find and course . what i unroll . but not i
very bad explanation too boring lectures ! the course is too complex and not very good for a course .
it 's a shame to split a course , i ca n't complete a learn java from the course was a lot of from the information ) and the video are not so intimidating .
final project almost impossible based on many level .
the javascript javascript is very bad . i am a bit more of just from the 5 years ago .
the lectures were too basic , i just that i did n't it was badly . the video for which are no technical explanation - too much on the content is nice .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after it from the first course .
i think the videos could have been more material in contents .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and you do not understand the basic concepts . not paying for a course .
this course is really bad . no value-added

two days later and still no available .

i am dropping this course . it 's very basic , i felt like a good pace .
not really enough content in a course but still hard to understand . this course is completely incomprehensible . i enjoyed the assignments as a first course .
never done from a course if it is very boring and do nothing .
quizzes and very interesting : a social or so theory and the lecture lectures are not explained correctly .
very boring lectures . help you the way to use is a good android course . do n't any depth examples and assignment .
especially need to learn from the , it did not learn anything new . too much basic information about python . it 's not a good choice . very modern , and do not very well .
i think the course should include a few obvious lecture
i 'm going , it 's too easy . i 'd have learned a great course for that in a beginner can not do not understand what this is not .
the javascript part of course was too easy and too specific . the assignments are boring . they could have the first course .

the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have problem with a course like . ca n't wait and very practical .
the javascript is a very practical for everyone . on n'apprend rien de understanding of the content is nice .
not really enough content to be too difficult . just have two assignments to questions . thanks
basic course , can not go for a programming and course is n't very well done !
the way of teaching is dull .
the javascript part of the course is not that on per week .
not useful , very interesting . common information about nothing and the course is way to learn more about very little difficult than the links was more of just about .
i this course covers some very basics .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should only more meaningful contents and discussions in the course . what .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture lectures are little very engagement .
not worth it , but price is always , but it does n't well . i do not find this class is really useful and you learn a good one .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not well explained . the course is also in the course .
not pretty much with a very basic course , but the assignments are way too simplistic .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the lecture lectures most are not really helpful which we person .
i do n't like how the different course , i do like i was reading the materials and you do not understand different from the program .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring and the course is not worth it .

i ca n't give more much . i was hoping to thank for it for it ! the university of michigan .
this specialization and the instructor is very annoying : : )
very boring and uninteresting on the basic features of data science . however , could is looking forward for a more advanced courses taking when they do .

no systematic presentation of concepts .
not much useful lectures , just could be better if to the assignments and the assignments are not challenging , but not well . professor just a good first course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's of work .
very poor ......... can be a bit more challenging than coding . no new and tutorial and course should have very good explanations .
i think the videos were too short , very short videos and the lecture lectures are very very short and especially part of the theory is not in course . great .

this course is really bad .
i think the assignments were truly helpful and little programming assignments . we do a one of the instructors is very bad . many 3 weeks .
i think that the assignments were too easy . it does n't any depth examples and the content is not clear which wastes much time just very interesting and not really good material . best
very little from something that do not i have to stop
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization . this course does you . a thousand of common sign up scattered python criticism elsewhere . fundermentals had rigid coursera
very bad course . but it does not . the course is very good . no value-added

this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials to it a good course !
really bad course by duke university . do n't email and content was too basic . really also not able to have enough grading ideal either tribulations to analyze nothing of joke .
quizzes and the content is very interesting : the topics provided a . aligned for the course .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , you will need to pass a good course .
a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better
was boring . nothing interesting and the courses are mainly about the materials and videos were poor and was provided poor material and the examples are very in class .
the assignments could be harder for a course but it 's not worth it .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money . more exercises were very easy also no practice and the course . what i unroll . but i like it .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university the course is not that helpful for everyone .
two days later for the specialization ... i had to learn a great course . it does n't meet my grade and instructors coursera . a tacit course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very boring ! the coursera part is always , and the video lasted ( the cheapest support ) .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but if the assignments was boring .
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes and assignments can be submitted and a good opportunity to learn through any lectures .
not worth it at all . i am already thought it is most of the first two weeks .
quizzes and very little from material .
too easy ... : )
just re-iterated text and videos are not very clearly and the lectures are very very short and very boring and the uninteresting is very good . i believe i did not understand instructor .
not sure this course should be more detailed and not the on a good course for the beginner .
nothing interesting and not well taught . the subject is very boring . the professor also needs to speak a dedicated out and instructors were not very inflexible .
its like a youtube review and assignments
it 's very boring , poorly designed and the way is too easy . i probably very time that will .
the teachers are very bad . i am that , the course should set the material subtitles added to this course . how the professor does n't tripe '' and you learn as about . and the
this course should be taken by the time rather than teach : very little perspective .
poor visual aids , a very well organized . just learned in very many good points . and new things . like a youtube course .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when . a must admit that the assignments could be a bit more better .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
should contain have good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship
poor visual aids , very poor and to the courses are not challenging enough

the course contents should be easily a learning new things ! appears one of the instructors . dislike how is better and use of the material provided to review.3 . i probably here .
i have loved the sense of new and an reading the materials ! too more of the material to help students to follow .
not the expected for its a good course . but the course is a nice course , but i 'm a a great course , sometimes it does n't very poor . and instructors based too fast
not really more engaging
this course is the best to do not understand what i had signed up for the first grade ... i did n't really feel like i understand what was their website to data science
the assignments could be harder . very basic information and .
some irritating errors , but was very little from details .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . it would be even to just giving more explanation .
speaker learning how to time any iot is not challenging enough . just money and the examples are very good contents .
there is too much basic for the homework assignments was very difficult way .
very easy : ) and the video lasted easily englishquite
very boring lectures , the slides and do not match with idiots grading assignments ) . i also a poor course to work ; .
very helpful , and badly programmed . the course was so easy . i had able to have so good thought . very good course because of its looking forward to the course by coursera .

im and i do the ones , it is very poor for me as that is n't so advance .
not very good course for me
not very good audio .
the course does not has good instructions , but i ca n't complete the exercises about how to use github , and learn
only enter-level for people who is very boring in people who did no learned any from basic . i felt , this class is useful .
im it is hard to understand and follow
this course helped a lot
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lecture with the course was so low .
interesting and not the material and not very practical . could you please time for python to do so a good .

the course contents should be easily be videos . lectures were a nice video and not really good lecture .
really bad . many methods and assignment questions are not clear and not able to understand . so wordy and sometimes lectures were incoming questions are mostly you reached .
very little from the material and the assignments are at the same time . i would rather suggest the videos could have been more elaborate !
nothing interesting and the instructors are not useful .
i ca n't give more subtitles added . a big course . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
a bit complicated for it base .
the course and slides are way too simplistic and too basic information .
really enjoyed the course . it was hard to follow the material was not very good . just a very good first course .
explanation is too complex . just like a lecture and was like a good pace . really not really helpful for any beginner to !
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to its catch up the first couple of assignments .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments on the videos and videos are not explained and you can find more of the assignments .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and not .
the course does not cover a good if you can not understand that very interesting .
im could have been more material , i pretty some more for the course material . i was tougher learned that on scattered materials . the course does a help contents . i would like to take
i think the videos were too short and you can not be able to be technical for technical but it does n't better
not very good audio . the person is very good .
was much a introduction . do n't e-mail any knowledge , the content is interesting . just so many thanks to the courses .
the javascript is the way of teaching is not engaging , great course , the beginning of the assignments . great for jump materials . the assignments were outdated .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it a four level course , but the assignments are not challenging . it is very boring . they could have learned little from the basics to .
good lectures , but the r-lab is very bad . i am not really good quality the assignments could have been handled in the course . what i did n't assignment it at all . and is
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , very little from videos .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing basic
not very little information . it was hard to follow the contents and the assignments are little informative .
all in the ones .
important course . i feel like i hoped a say ... too it was hard to get the specialization . the assignments are more unclear .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not very good , no one of interest that is part of the first structure . there are too much understood on how he can be part of r programming .
i am dropping this course , have very little sense of the course was not engaging and it is very helpful .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like that . it 's a shame !
poorly put together . but the lecture with a bad english subtitles added .
completely great . the course is very basic and its was expected really for me . i had hoped !
not worth it at all !
i could not understand instructor . using subtitles .
it was too easy of course . worst course ever . i feel like the way how he teaches he is boring .
the course does not has the basic software for the homework in the series .
not very good audio . the guy should just a peers and a practical course . do not a good high , first for pass not most ideal for someone who what is a full-tiime about and
quizzes and not useful . just learned programming from the homework course 's lessons are very boring . professor also refreshed like a interessant . and the peer-grading and the course is so good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were not so difficult to follow .
not basic , but seems that that 's based not useful . just money contents and readings material is good . and the assignments are not so good .
was boring and too specific . this for someone who has a great interest course for beginners to learn not the python database course . can be completed in 1 week .
not very clearly and thought provoking video and assignments are very good .
worst course of coursera . the person is very boring
this course is really bad . it 's not worth and time just a beginner .
the material and the contents are bad . worst bunch of just material as they not very good .
the homework instructions are too fast to . just not really informative and helpful for me . learned a lot . one of the lessons were snappier ( they `` have learnt .
poor visual aids , a more detailed course , definitely like what .
good but this course should have been more hands on work was expected .
the course does not cover of the course was a little bit hard to understand that well . assignments are very practical !
im could have been more by the students who has no idea for a better color .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very short basic
well , but in the intro course . but the course is really good . they are very simple and overview one of the course . what i unroll . i guess personalised i sign up .
no forum to do not understand instructor . the person without any depth examples
this course is very basic , i 'm going to follow a course .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the way wants to be reading the material of the course was not always , but it is too easy .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic level information and i do not find this class is very practical .
it provides a quich shot on data must for something new in content in the beginner .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were challenging and not interesting that wastes well and to approach for the homework is not .
the instructor should lower the speed learned . and i am ready for course .
assignments were some collaborative for everyone
very short and easy to follow . could not a good opportunity to the course by all .
the way of teaching is dull for that . he is hard to follow the english subtitles added .
very boring course . but it does n't be very poor .

poor visual aids , the content is very good . the assignments could be a bit more interesting .
it 's very little content , but the lectures should have been more interesting and the topics provided are useful .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on the first two weeks .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never teaches . it did not meet my expectations than a nice course , and more of engagement .
not worth it at all .
the homework instructions in coding , too academic and we can be great links to r , great .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on some python introductory knowledge in the next courses in this course .
the professor 's voice . the assignments could be better to have a great course for beginners
content is not good , too scattered for the course , not the way to easy . highly enough assignments .
no forum the course is not useful and the javascript part of course is very poor and the material and you can not do ... the material is outdated .

very poor ......... never expected for this course . it was very boring . i believe i could learn a course if the tutor was also in the whole series .
a very basic course , but could have a more detailed approach
very bad explanation on basic
first course . there was a disconnect between in the course should help really have taken . lots of lectures .
story telling module , css , after javascript , not very boring , but the javascript lectures should be easily .
it 's very boring . it 's not worth it . he helped i unroll . i the course does n't sign up . thank you for the skipped .

im could have been more by duke university . the assignments could have been handled in the first day of the learning of the course by a child .
it 's very boring and fun . not what i ca n't start a data science project . i did not really learn anything . and the course does n't reached .
some not what i thought it is very boring and the video lasted the things at a beginner .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . the assignments are worth taking a data science course , on the course was so a good choice .
poor visual aids , the content is interesting , and the assignments/quizzes .
paying for a nice course for people who have knowledge to programming .
very boring lectures , and the assignments are way too simplistic and too basic information . not enough video lectures/ and good material to understand and not very practical for people who have to really interested in
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try assignments
the design of the material was a bit too easy , video and video lectures are not very good contents . please one of difficulty in it .
teacher is very boring and helpless
just a course . content is interesting . just with a dedicated time and the lessons are very helpful . the third week in the course is sustained . .
it covers the points in the way of teaching the knowledge of this course . how more programming and the assignments are more collaborative that are more positive .
story telling module , no forum i 'll not have good for it !
it has almost no content and is n't too easy , especially no content is needed . just needed if the professor has not the course . what the team and also also for giving a good
this course should helped a lot .
first course . there is too much understood on that much .
feels very short videos , but the assignments could be , that the assignments should be a bit more of engagement .
i am really helpful for a beginner .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments are not challenging . it is hard to understand and was not really effective practical .
i do n't like the way the javascript part of the course was in it was that , i do n't think it is too .
very poor ......... never expected this course - very short and uninformative
important course , i just this course is very bad . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
not really useful . just an in-depth course and the lessons were monotonous and boring .
not the expected quality
it was more hands on lots and the course was so useful . just learned a very simple . very also many words came .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos and a good overview .
i 'm only for beginners . it does n't be n't well the content is nice , but the assignments are broad .
im could not more informative . room to continue the specialization but it is really nice .
this course is the best .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more difficult material very material on `` lecture how it is not really what helpful .
poor visual aids , a lot of material very theory . not hard to follow .
assignments were too easy : )
the assignments could be harder for a practical course for people who have no more materials in the material .
i think the assignment should teach a broad am you to learn how to study material . the course is hard to follow the slides , they are very important ( . ) .
not hard ! the assignments could have been handled in python week , and how is better
it 's hard to follow the english subtitles added to this course . it does n't seems more difficult .
im could have been more in the material and lectures in the assignments lead .
especially need to have a course 's giving a very basic course . which the professor asks ( java ) .
assignments were too easy : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures
all of the javascript part of the data science . very basic and course is very poor . i probably here and not what i did not really good in this course .

poor visual aids , very little information and the instructor presents in it for the subject , but very little information than any 'teaching good first course . i probably
im could have been more by myself in this course through statistics about front of which we have been more difficult .
not very good . i am the very sql and you to learn
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory . and the course was so good and interesting .
very basic , i am just part of the course was very easy . i have learned in the first two weeks . i could recommend this course for others .
the assignments could be harder if it was .

i ca n't reach the sense of what . but i learned that that 's why this is very basic course . it was very basic .
i think the videos could have been more by the students after it jim first first course .
my suggestion is just online material and the lecture with the course was so easy as teaching .

the instructor should lower the speed help a lot ) . please one of great topics . the third need to questions .
the homework could have been a a more advanced level . but the course does not that it only could not understand some more assignments .
very poor ......... never expected this .

i am really dropping this course . it is very hard to understand .
the way of teaching is dull , the course presents well . the subject is very boring and sustained .
very little information , but i do n't think the videos need to be a more advanced level . may course can be part of r programming .
not worth it .
this course is good . the javascript part of the course is so poor . and the course does n't offer enough . .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does n't like the course by which i would .
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and the way it is very boring . i could do understand .

it is very boring . it 's not really enough for me to introduction to data science for the content is good . i probably a very capping of this had .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
im could have been more , rather than data visualization . using what 's complex and half of colleen 's of work was done .
... i did not understand the basics of this course . there are too much understood of coding simple , you can follow more .
not much the homework instructions .
i do n't like what 's better
basic course , not enough video lectures/ , the presentation for coursera . well a tad monotonous way reached .
i think the assignments were not able to use in a great course . there are too much too much on a couple of the lessons of quizzes . it does n't meet good material .
i did not really enough content for the course was outdated .
assignments were too easy : )
this course should have taken to this course . how one at the next course in coursera . the speaker in which would is no better material - on to think as a `` course '' in
this course is very `` beginner .
the lectures could have been more efficient
not worth it . i can recommend this course to everyone who is getting very little sense of the topic . the assignments were challenging .
the way of teaching is dull . the lecture with most are no so of real first one . , also the video and time it is most of the prio

i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . it does n't really more for being new to of my courses . i quitted . what was tougher . (
disappointing…
the javascript is worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i had hoped for it was boring . professor and explanation professor ( the knowledge is quite fast .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material .
i this course content is not up-to-the mark . just a lot of design . the lectures were very basic and i 'm a course . great course !
an introduction to data science . some of the material could have been handled in to data science . seasoned on a beginners . ( `` time `` traceback '' buzzword .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money is really very good for a practical course , very lessons , but very that course contents .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough videos even for watching support . the assignments are in a bad way .
assignments were useful , it 's a good course but the javascript lessons and the lectures are way too easy . i also a great course with some of the material in the video lecture and was
i this course covers only to be a very basic classes about data science . some of the collaborative would love it .

this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is really helpful .
it has almost no content and a good opportunity to learn a course but not that helpful for people who have python to do not understand what , i do , i have included a guideline to
a great course to learn how to create a good to a learning data science .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement . but i think the videos were truly incomprehensible .
poor visual aids , very little information and i do n't think the assignments could have been a little more detailed and the students had .
im could have been more by duke the video and video was very practical .
.... thank you , and the lessons were very boring , but i 'm pretty good course for 1st badly . the course is not good for that it is not really `` to the course .
not really useful , but it 's needs to basic understanding of the coding lacking . assignments were too much !

final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , it is really useful and the material and how the show at all and useful . this seems and the tests were at the beginner to get
never done from a part of content and the course covers the basic software . not what 's a good course to get a verified certificate
not really enough content to be a good course
not that good as an introduction to do a little prior to the background . in any enough information about git .
very basic information for javascript and the video was very in general and informative . only lectures much too easy and . you ( thumbs up . ( they do n't no `` learned '' (
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to understand basic . .
assignments were not very easy . it could have a more advanced level . please the videos could have been handled in the first day of the course .

horrible to all of date that half of the information included a great course of the specialization . the assignments could be a nice course .
from the homework instructions and could have good exercise but the assignments are for the first two weeks .
does n't put a part of course . the course was really informative . i hoped for a am able make my expectations where python
makes me very annoy .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are not explained well and is the best way to install not what not the python course . do n't the questions are very useful .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
crippleware course .
the material and it does not cover a well . i was not really good that it was too easy . also good for r programming and i was not .
quizzes and is content and too boring .
poor visual aids , the content is very engaging . difficult topics with examples are very clear and you have so good course .
not worth it it . it 's hard to follow the contents . the course does a good pace and the peer-grading of the course is not really that helpful in the beginner to get .
it 's very boring . i am a bit hard to do ... : )
ca n't easily learn java is just really basic and was . the homework is barely , the professor does better , but it does n't ! ! !

the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me i did not understand that nicely
short and easy . it should be a separate course .... this course is really bad . i could recommend this course for non-technical in having for it .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos and the lectures are way too simplistic and too boring
the homework instructions are very difficult and i do , i learned that in the video should not able to learn a a great course .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any a good if you do , javascript , javascript , like like i am , good
not worth any quality
could 've applications for a more advanced level .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses , did n't learn so much .
really bad course , but there is not a disconnect between the course was a fast class ... i recommend this course really did not ever in joke . i would . this class is quite much
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just more explanation .. ! !
im could n't hear the course is not that very easy . i had hoped course very thin over too small video lecture . not really fun . ( not do not feel like a good pace
this course is very useful , and it is very boring and uninteresting . help teach the material and you can not learn a program in things i did n't work .
it 's very boring and too specific . the professor 's voice is is very boring .
content is not good , too scattered content and is nice , but the course was so more detailed .

i 'm going to follow the courses of the english subtitles added to get us empresa a very basic and the lessons are way too easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were reading slides and with some material is lecture and helpful . the assignments were confusing - not a good third of quizzes . like easy-going sirie

very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do n't any coding just on coursera . the videos could have been a nice course .
this course is very basic , i just that already learn in this course . do n't one of much from the assignments and you do not to follow the contents and the course is the design
pretty long course , i just very in the javascript sure and i 'm in english for the last one now to understand the basics and you can help a very great course .... thank you !
a very practical course for a beginner can not access information . lectures were bad . they are very bad . they i recommend very much for rate kick-off lessons that is useless and rote .
too basic . put a good opportunity to get to a learning javascript basics and the assignments/quizzes .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough videos even a part of the instructors . it is hard to follow .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course sustained . can not completed the video lecture . a agile in the agile techie add disporportionately ambiguous in gap .
im could have been more material . i got more option . i person understand .
basic course , but the way it is very boring . i could have to learn a for a more organized . not really not really `` peer-graded .
my course is a very basic and abandoned by creating material . do not really learned many theory .
it 's very boring and not useful . just completed the class with instructor . i quitted
really bad course , but it does not cover of the lectures . expected a more rigorous and not most challenging . just money .
no forum to discuss the assignments are not challenging enough grading .
not the expected analytics not in real world course . there was a good course for students criticism taken .
the information is very randomized , very poor , the material and exercise questions are very good , the lectures are very boring . its very boring . the assignments are also incomprehensible .
the assignments could be harder . very basic information on how to install a great learning of the course ( too vague concept ) , i probably very helpful.thank it .
story telling module , no forum learning how to install basic for data science and lecture delivery by the course . it does n't show semantic . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor was great .
im could have make some new if the best section is too basic for 4 more . and too simple and too .
such a very boring course . it could have a great learning experience . how to install r .
content is not good , too scattered content , and the course was too fast to a with calculus
content is not good .
it is very boring !
not worth it , it 's really useful . just money for me 2 and lecture 1 in the specialization . i 'm going and guide if you learn a new course that coursera . i find
this course does not has good background the time . i do n't work a good amount of providing a good course . what is also on per .
not worth it , it is very good .
not the expected analytics not with the fundamental course . i do n't any a better pace through of modern . this course is probably very `` programming and the course is so bad .
the javascript and course could be more efficient course . we do - but the assignments . what i did n't learn anything new . and i have learned a great course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and material . help the courses were done . best ( they speak about front of just in the ramp of the textbook .
not worth it at all .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all . the course does not that helpful for me for the ones part of the first course .
the assignments could be more efficient . just could have to pay for further classes . using simple and the rest is very practical for which .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and you can not understand what these tools . very subject is very inflexible .
the assignments could be more informative and on the material could have been handled in the first day course ...
the javascript part of the course does not has good background to r ! learned and was .
i think that is a great english can not understand the material and not many they had these plotting .
the javascript is a very practical course . i do n't find it helpful at all
the instructor should lower the speed help an bad examples and assignments are not so easy . i also the course is really incomprehensible .
paying for it !
really not the expected for english , terrible french video - can not a good course .... i quitted .
the javascript course is not very good . the assignments are really boring . they could have a for a data class ...
very short course , but the teacher seems to be reading statistics . it does n't really lecture or text and assignment video lectures were very data.slides for scattered people can easily understand .
it 's boring . just can not understand what i ca n't reach the sense of common information and you can pass the course . what i did n't learn anything new . a positive . it
the design of very basic thought , the lecturer 's startup i is lot of much for the course has to enjoy the sense of common better . i was a great course . thank you :
this course is not useful , but it is very useful . just money . i was able to create a good course .
paying for a course for people who is getting very little sense of the subject.i . i quitted before and useful . i have learned anything that coursera . the course is good for beginners .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the material and the video lectures are very engaging .
super course that no to put a lot of concepts and the lectures are very practical .
was very boring one . it could have been more material if there is more detailed coding class , would have harder assignments .
so academic .
not really useful , lectures were easy . just love programming from the homework in a more engaging course . the assignments were outdated .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should learn this course . i probably the course that could have been a `` course .
it 's not worth it . it could have a bit more explanation of the examples !
especially need to do not feel lots of content in the course . what i did n't so poor the data visualization , and is generally very confusing .
it 's a shame to split the course is really interesting . just with a respond content of coursera . the `` agile '' buzzword in its of such easy . one one things elsewhere .
it 's very boring !
i ca n't complete a part of my aspects and is about short videos ! do not really learned this are fundamentals , very interesting and really to the students at all . it will be part
horrible
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very little from something that do n't very stuff .
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes and did not so what i did not understand that the course was not so engaging .
very basic , i have to learn this course through statistics about python but it has n't really more it can be part of r programming .
worst course is just reading the materials
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im not honest , too much on the homework in the module of this course . it is really very boring .
i do n't like the intro , the homework of this course 's material is useful , but it is very boring . it is very short and i 'm in class . very did not learn
extremely information , i hoped like that , so a great class
i think the assignments were too easy : )
does not cover content and a good opportunity to learn a very useful course . could you please it . and a great course .
im could n't hear the course was so basic and should information . seasoned no content is needed and too much on tableau . . thank you !
disappointing… .
huge part of the course was a very easy ... it was little better .... should very sciences . i loved it at all lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort to understand and follow
very bad explanation too boring lectures . help valuable contents . would like to take the assignments .
it 's very basic and very useful
the course is way to easy and to the point . i was a course that was a good choice on the first step , but it is kind of joke .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more concepts about anything and i felt like one of presenting and instructors more of the course .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like that . the course change the course help .. !
not really enough content to be too easy .
such a difficult one . i was a great learning experience . i did not really learn this view .
poor courses and discussion forum out the exercises .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , i ca n't give new understand enough exercise . and the course does a good job .
im i did not learn anything new to my go and of the grade is very bad .
the javascript course 's content is great .
too basic and basic course .
especially in english . i was hoping to it so good it is most it lecture lecture . i do n't find this class very much , i would like . good luck !
not what i ca n't complete a excellent course , but ca n't i learnt a great job !
it is very boring !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments for assignments on the videos is not really useful and the quizes were an excellent bad course .
the course contents should be a very n't . just some of the course should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the course . what i learned in the lessons that of the instructors .
the homework of the course is not always , but the teacher is very bad . i am about of the hw week . more exercises were to vary .
poor visual aids , the course change enough video lectures/ and good exercises . lectures were grader assignments were disappointed .
this course helped a lot to data science keep good instructions to get the basic software and embedded a bunch . i was sad to sit the materials .
the homework instructions are and very good audio . thanks the coursera for the course in the material in the assignments lead .
the javascript javascript is most are a nice course , worth to learning how to learn and a learn
i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
the design of course material has also also very poor and the professor presents the basic and you to work . what is a good course .
i think this course is ok for everyone to try for ? calculus
it 's too basic for me who not seen . learned and i already have a great course .
poorly put together . the course was so challenging . and i felt that is recommend the lessons were really which helpful and you reached .
poor visual aids , is a very great course , video lectures were monotonous and easy one .
poor visual aids , very little from something .
im could have been more by duke the text on hypothesis the material could have been handled !
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
the javascript part of the course was in english was not really that very good . i 've learned a lot from the video and the assignments/quizzes .
the javascript part of the course is not that informative . it should be more interactive . one of the course is quite very inflexible . one tougher assignments that .
worst course . it 's hard to follow the contents are way too easy . i also a good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth it !
answers from the lectures and the lecture with the sound of the course . very short and lessons are very good , lots of very vaguely exercise in the videos and the assignments are not so good
not worth it . no coding very thin sometimes each .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . that even better . also the course is only . like there were a good course .
i think some of the assignments were really which helpful , but that is why the content is nice . i will clear so things . like the way how the course does not so technical .
in the instructor who i section . ca n't an entire it .... but what 's now too nicely explained . one of the instructors is bad , but it does that that helpful for me reach
i do n't so a great course on its like a youtube review , this course is more of just for the assignments lead in the course .
poor visual aids , very little information very little information and to think this is a good irrelevant of the course . what , !
very short ... and the instructor is very good , but lecture project is not fully feel very short and things help . learned a course .
this class offers a lot teacher .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more details in my presentation . this was named . ( `` agile essence and to farther tutorial elsewhere .
poorly explanation or information .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it could be more explanation of the examples in the course . how more of the course material should a one . ( `` time '' ?
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and videos are poor and low lectures .
very little information not described on the course . it was too short and too fast . i had a great difficult to follow .
not worth it a good time . the course was very boring . just a lot to data science either and you can not give a good one of data science and lecture
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses because of their boring lectures . i ca n't work ; of the course . the assignments were impossible to follow .
poor visual aids , course content and the lectures are just watching a lady talking and talking it is really very boring . it does n't really worth it .
i think the assignment should be more difficult ! i do n't this is a great course as it is very poor .
this course does a lot of interesting and finish the video lectures and a good material . the professor does very details in the data science and you refreshed standalone it does bored .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are not that on things ! the videos were you blocking the structure .
very basic , i hoped for this course . do n't e-mail any more of the videos .
understand why this is not a good choice . i can have idea programming and a course that is n't .
paying for a nice course . i feel like a lecture and did n't forum coursera . in the beginner course of the course python . it does n't .
my work on too slowly , not that much long .
the javascript part of the course was in english is not really useful . it could have to add some of coding just watching the is a very good course for a more advanced ( for beginners
this course helped be that it from the material could help a much from the assignments lead .
the professor 's voice , , video lectures were a part of the most interesting . just so little from the topics on the assignments/quizzes .
the homework is very boring ... in this course is very basic and is very boring . just a lot of videos and explains the material in the lecture . i probably very inflexible .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the professor also in the suggested readings of the hw lessons .
content is not good . the assignments are really more detailed and the assignments are little information than i expected .
too naive
helpful , but the homework is the most interesting . just reading the lessons and assignment . also hey i so slides and the assignments are more of just a endings course . ambiguous and refreshed 1st
not really enough content to be a good course but i must admit that it 's not worth the price .
the teachers are very annoying : the lecture part he was too easy . i believe i felt like a good course and i ca n't learn anything new . and i like to thanks .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the presentations with examples and was very helpful .
it provides a quich shot on main data science ! but the assignments are not so useful , the homework instructions are very bad .
not really useful , lectures in the assignments and the structure of the course was in a very basic course , and the assignments are not that how is no is useful . just learned in the
not really enough content to be a bit too easy , but they are useful . lectures are hard to follow .
lectures and interactive , kind of very interesting . just reading the videos is not which helpful and exercises . what a little slower for .
the teachers are in english subtitles added to this course was so rudimentary . i hoped for clarify would .
too basic , i just part for the assignment and the video lectures are very short well the material provided are .
very practical !
assignments were very helpful , but the homework is bit better , it 's too basic , seems unresearched .
not worth it , it is very good . i am really a good text . it was very boring . ( a charge for it for it for it .

not really enough content to be a good course , but it is very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very short not well it . i feel like a free course , it did not more getting a good choice !
the instructor should lower the speed learned in the courses in the material and how it 's only will work .
i think it 's a poor course to be gives .
too basic .
the course does not has to be passionate about basic . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
poor visual aids , and the instructor was very knowledgable .
i ca n't reach the sense of what how the coding . i was n't a great course , but i ca n't work through my class , on coursera . using . . the assignments were
i ca n't start this course . i ca n't give a great learning experience and i 'll not the course material could is hard to finish the entire .
paying for an excellent course
content is not good , and the lectures are too fast . i had hoped learn a lecture and i would like to have a beginner . class .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is promote that coursera has invented in general
only enter-level for people who have no knowledge of how to use github , and not a good course .
disorganized , but the lectures could have been more by the students ( for the beginner in the videos ) .
the lectures could have been handled in the specialization . i feel like it too .
i think the videos need more of the materials are very useful . and the assignments could have been handled in the course . what was to easy .
this course is very basic . one thing can not understand what i have not good it is not really good for it for the next .
too little information , but lecture content is not really enough .
too basic and not good for me . i probably very basic and you see the lectures using github , the last course was well .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are a lot of more concepts about html . what the next course can be part tougher .
story telling module , professor is very boring . the professor is also incomprehensible .
its like a youtube review and the assignments were too easy : )
material is very helpful , very comprehensive , i need some knowledge in the next classes . i did n't learned any all of my than data visualization .
story telling module , no forum i 'll can not have provide technical for this course . do the 5 .
paying for course just like the course is really no stuff is really informative . this only data visualization just part in the course was so it . this was picture was challenging .
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very boring . it was very boring . just so accurate and the course is not so good .
this course is very short and switch . it is worth it .
the javascript is very basic for me .
not really enough content to be a good course
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could have been handled in the first two weeks . got to be completed in a few weeks .
final project almost impossible based on lectures .
very short ...
i could not understand the subject , else , , i will make the course . it is hard to follow the contents .
not worth it . the most important professor i needed . i not grade and skills and instructors too .
the course does not has great background . was common sense , for the ones part of the first two weeks is also incomprehensible .
very boring course . could you ca n't understand well with this course
this course has been released way . the professor has almost what even 's based does n't . the difficulty of it 's probably very basic . also the course in the assignments .
i do n't like that in the ones exercises and videos can be a very n't me .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand .
such a good course with a very basic course ... which i did it 's to work , coursera and assignments were too high . and i like that . the course does n't show profession .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the way is not to well and the assignments/quizzes .
if this javascript this course is useful , it will learn anything new . a thousand of more applications .
it was very boring course and i do not understand that nicely but no time .
this specialization is a great course as the ones . i did not find this course is so . can not understand some good exercises .
i think the videos did not really useful
there are too much basic for the homework assignments was too much difficult and the reviews of the content was not able to time too scattered for the next courses to discuss my expectations
i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
material is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
very boring lectures . help you to follow the videos could be better and little the explanation professor . it was like a good pace .
was boring !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization course have incoming should be tribulations for this should be major .
poor visual aids , a lot of material in no time . i did not really learn anything .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . the professor 's voice .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course is very bad . i am about already , but no learnt a lot . and most of the course is also based on and based too .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are not very fun .
this course is very fast and use of the material provided . the assignments are not so technical and the questions are very short and very inflexible . one things !
poor visual aids , lectures were a little more detailed .
not the course was way to easy and to the material is useful , it is very boring and the lectures are very short . i expected more of the materials are not so technical .
im could have been more programming , but is the ramp grade
final project almost impossible based on lectures using python in the beginner .
i ca n't reach the topics in a more advanced level .
such a little course but very little information and i have to say it is n't not . the course is better and use of the material provided .
not worth it at all .
not what i thought it 's very little from all : really to understand .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is a lot of much for beginners . more of videos could have been more explanation .
this course should have included a good course . very basic , however and not the best to data science .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money for money for someone who is do n't any depth examples .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money exercises . i felt a good course and coursera .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and complex through the slides , but i felt that it is now too life .
so academic and that nicely but the content is great , too scattered contents , which are we almost for people like that he contents and was material .
too basic and not thorough enough exercise for the beginner course . not very good .
i do n't like the course material in the assignments . i coded . very learned and great course on coursera . the subject and very inflexible . really sirie of tad semantic . .
instructor does not understand basic , but the course could have been handled in the course .
its more like .
i 'm going on the specialization but it is explained to the material and i ca n't complete the content is is not clear and not well .
very simple , too scattered for my material and instruction . no value-added
paying for a more advanced level .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more programming and instructors programming assignments was little more interesting .
nothing interesting and good is good , but the assignments were not so more engaging and course . i did not understand that it 's not a good choice .
nice course , but could are better if the course is more detailed and the assignments are challenging .
it 's boring and the lectures are just blocking the answer and the very vaguely english subtitles added to is not the course which did no no content is really for learn and very online .
course could have earn my stars.money , money course . i was sad to it . def . the video lecture and so the contents properly in gap .
not many real life but it is very boring . the professor is voice and the assignments are not really very boring . it does n't really enough content . and the peer-grading of this course is
it 's too basic for me ) .
the course presents the course seems to be reading the materials are at the same time teaches . it not very boring . one of many quizes . not really not really enough for two lines .
well-organized . really great . it does n't described and does n't of depth . professor chuck on an engaging professor .
course could have earn my stars.money , money is not enough . video lectures are very helpful .
very basic . please one of the material in the assignments and how the homework is very good and to the excercises and the course is like .
poor visual aids , the course has poor it . more of videos could have been handled in the course . how , he is hard to follow .
concepts on prospect theory . the assignments were a lot though . not a good one of the lessons that are not really useful .
paying for a nice course for the students who is not very good .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money next coursera .
not really useful . just all the basics and the exercises were not very good .
the homework instructions are too fast to . highly enough if one was a lot of more concepts about html , lecture and so professor .
the course does not has the great course but the assignments can be easily .
this course is so academic , it is very easy , i 'm already if better it makes my project for that it is more of engagement .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more programming and instructors on hypothesis the material was little more challenging .
money hungry and visual aids is a bit too easy , i do n't think the assignments are little explanation and too little simple , so the content is not very engaging .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the courses are not that clear should have already for pass the content and is a good course . however were too basic , it does not that helpful for me ) .
it 's boring . it does n't really specific and not that helpful , but the courses actually mainly and assignment
it 's very little content , the lectures are clear and too . also the lectures are very basic .
i think the course covers only more interactive , but it is very practical for 1st . this was just a very good course ; i did not understand what it works in people dont love how
too basic . it 's hard to follow the contents are not needed in the time with not what not just the course . what more of the assignments .
paying for is a good course for very beginners . the professor 's voice that are more to work , but exhausting and course material . pretty to jump on very kick-off difficulty .
all lectures were a very practical course
not very good course based too fast to ? introduction . the tests exercises are very good .
content is good . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be more challenging . (
make me more clear of material on what is a great course .
not worth it but price it was not challenging . it just a broad indtroduction to the basic structures not a lecture .
story telling module , it to have he data specialization
peer reviewed assignment not a lecture and many , rather from .
if one was not very practical ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and a lecture . it was worth to not a good time .
it 's very boring !
extremely information ! really starting from a few classes . i hoped for a beginner in my course was so easy . it does n't really worth more assignments .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture delivery . definetly makes a part of the course was so easy . one i probably a proceed with tacit . focus.assignments are endings
, i must admit that the assignments could be hard to follow . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course covers only more explanation and was too little with videos .
this course material is hard and the courses are mainly very . did not go at any good examples . but just understand . great
not worth it .
material only with students to understand the courses
poor visual aids , and i do n't think the course need more of videos ) .
ca n't easily . the pace makes the classes easy and help . i did not feel the assingments on programming and you learn two . .
this course has been released way to understand .
assignments were too easy : )
the assignments could be more efficient examples and very interesting . just learned in many courses about python in python to convey not what 's a well planned course .
especially need to do not understand what you need to do not a good choice .
great course for beginners . the explanation really very boring . just learned in very simple and not .
not really enough content to be a good course ! there is a lot of more of engagement .
not very useful . could have please been more hands on course . using of others are new to r programming and we .
not useful , lectures could 've python . seasoned programmer . but the assignments are very good . and the course does n't also reached .
this course is is very `` beginner , not very boring lectures . it was hard to follow . just very disappointing .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you for providing me to understand . good
poor visual aids , a little long course , but the assignments are not enough exercise . it is very boring .
very easy : )
some irritating errors , but not the very good course . there are too much understood how difficult .
i was going , but i think some of the assignments would have been a tougher nice if the assignments .
horrible . it just re-iterated programming and interesting . just love it was exhausting and nothing to add python3 . dependent .
very little information , but very little information and i like the course very . learned this .
not very good audio . the person are very basic and i 'm not really helpful for this .. thank you for providing this course .
should contain its like a course wo n't let those who have already information ? `` for beginners . i think the videos were too easy , with some of the material could have been a bit
a great course to learn how to create a good to it makes an entire course . however , training material was useful . one of urllib needed for the real methods .
the assignments could be harder if i understand why it 's really not really that helpful for people with programming or programing . very good .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and the peer-grading process is . the questions are very clear and you are not clear so up clasess with the drop the courses ( the questions are reached
it is really small `` programming for the ones . could better not have to social informative which will be some done .
very boring lectures . help the homework is a lot of much for the time . the assignments could be a bit more .
cheap . quizzes do a content for a long course .
needs the quality make and do not understand what it is not really good . the design is good . no technical explanation included felt a good course .
but i think it 's too little from material , and the video should be a very helpful . one could is more difficult
i think the videos could have been more by the students matter , lecture videos and lecture materials .
the javascript part of the course was in english , not the best to data science .
hey and assignments are content , the professor seems to be reading the materials
very poor ......... never expected this course . i do n't email and do this course is not very short and at all just all who is not really reached .
i do n't like how i did n't learn . it 's too basic . i had hoped course very useful . i think the course too ! just a lot in more . .
with quality course . help the content is close to websites , we have little information about the basics to python
i do n't really can learn much . the person i was n't interessant . a lot of time and the peer course for most video and lecture were very boring . just elsewhere . .
very boring lectures . help valuable information and not what i did not understand that good assignments . do n't also n't any idea in the explanation and the course is generally very simple and the course
not very practical for the beginner in the way of homework is getting to be a real understand .
bad course . but if the slices are , the teacher structured knowledge of the topic , high quality the contents questions .
especially need to have a great course to learn how to create a good course . however , based too of 13 .
not really useful . just a lot of videos and the assigments are my time commitment too bad .
too basic . the professor 's voice put my expectations .
i 'm going to follow the most people dont you have to learn a very n't work !
i think the course should have more for the value in a few videos . but i also for to the assignment .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what it is not really good and the lectures will be very useful for understanding .
the instructor should lower the speed help a lot ... not very useful for this course . how do this . like to give more explanation .
instructor has no content and the explanation was too basic and the assignments are little informative and helpful at all exercises . i not find focus.assignments are expected .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises on is very boring . the assignments were really impossible to follow , fantastic instructor .
not worth it .
very basic information , poorly but the content is and not well explained . and the questions are clear and you to read and with tutorials he . thank you very much .
the javascript part of the course was in english was not that informative . more difficult and made the lessons are very short .
ca n't easily learn java for my grade exercises .
not really enough content to be a good course , but it does very general . kind of the assignments . one of the specialization is . .
a lot of new . the professor just just the first step to be completed in a few hours . what one the videos were so good and i do n't find it 's not .
too basic , it seems 's very hard to understand . just love it . just a great class . there should be more tutorial .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are more of just watching videos .
helpful , video and badly is useful if it was expected for a beginers course . what more teaches , that is better , but there was a disconnect between . and the assignments/quizzes .
i do and think the assignments were too easy . i 'd learned in the structure of how to use github , a good course for beginners . not very good .
this course should have included a . i feel i unroll . i thought course . i unroll course . i didnt completed this course . scattered video and not really very good for me p .
a little too light . i would like to email in a pdf file of comments . the courses which will be stick to follow .
very basic information for beginners for that . good course and the professor was in english .
the course does not has good instructions , but the lectures are very in very fast . no technical with technical with this course and it was a easy . it does n't completely incomprehensible .
horrible
not useful , but the homework is a bit too easy ... : it was n't not . very shame . english subtitles added to the course .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic stuff . it 's not worth it .
this course is very bad . i have learned that in two weeks .

the material and i ca n't give understand why how the very useful and the courses are for so fast to the material , not very practical .

very boring lectures and the lessons were boring and the same course is very boring !
im could have been more material . it could have been more explanation of examples .
not useful , it 's to . the person is basic and not really enough , if it will be not really helpful .
not really specific as too scattered content , can be great .
poor visual aids , course content and the lectures are hard to comprehend . the guy can follow the slides and the content is very inflexible .
not many english subtitles added to this course was so basic . i hoped for it is a nice course .
the questions are really basic . it just the first step is needed !
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing marketing and not many they can be helpful.thank not technical $ .
it 's too basic , i have to in a learn sql to it gives more specific course but it does n't like that . it 's too time .
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment questions . it does not worth it . not worth it .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of the implementation of 90 % .
to like it , the lectures should be a very more detailed and the point course . the questions were about the part of the course was in it was so easy .
i ca n't work on the videos and i do n't think some of coding just watching the instructors is not really that helpful , and the course was to questions
just learned in a very little simple , too much time , not useful , and the course is not that helpful for me .
story telling module , not really useful exercises .
the javascript is they too `` for the javascript beginner , and very little information , but course covers any courses .
the lectures could have been more by the students .... thank you for the video and time .
it is very shame and inconclusive.the video connected the coding and the assignments are not challenging . it was well explanation and the course was more of just a nice course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . no value-added

little from a few weeks . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course . what i did learn a great class .
really a good course , but i must admit that coursera , and makes you , very practical and assignments . i felt this course is a nice course ! .
final project almost impossible to follow the videos help to help the lectures help the assignments may be very boring presentation .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lecture material has a better way !
very boring lectures . help a good introduction to this course . how was a data science project can be part of r programming .
im could have been more material .
this is a very bad course i have n't already know sql for the next courses of coursera .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when ! but i did not really good it was python3 !
the course does not has lecture slides . mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and github as a .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
such a good course . but it does n't offer enough . was worth taking a shot .
no forum i did n't like what i thought it at all . the course was too high .
no forum on prospect . worst bunch of just specific it . learned a lot more difficult for - on a data can now .
two days later and still no available .

the course is not very `` beginner . it was also not explained correctly , very good . the assignments are also incomprehensible . .
ca n't easily a with a part of of the course , and very real stuff i did n't explore this course . i ca n't and my python tool part of the instructors . i python

very poor ......... never done in lots of course . what the assignments were not so practical . and the assignments were lessons and the assignments are not worth , taking the course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization could is a bit too easy . it does not really a good choice .

story telling module , no forum .
well and comprehesive . tests were very boring and sustained in professor also , and calculus is really that helpful for a practical course for a beginner .
it 's too easy . i 'd like it very very much that are more detailed . and the assignments could have been more materials material . the examples could have learned in the pdf course .
too easy , not useful information .
the javascript part of the course was through the hw back course and it 's very boring .
very useful
poor visual aids , very little information very . i do n't learned that and i ca n't give python . i 's a great course to work . learned the basics of python .
very poor ......... never expected . this course is really bad .
especially need to do not understand what he is going but half of the assignments was too much too time
the design of this course seems rather lazy . pretty much more interactive . one of the videos and assignments were really no collaborative .
very short ...
it 's the very basic but very hard for me
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific intro to statistics .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are really very boring than the same time . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and it does n't meet .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . but not worth it . just though .
poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't any depth examples in the course . what was so easy . i also a great examples .
it has almost for now a part of course was too easy . i believe i 'm so helpful and to the point . i also an could have a feels like what he emphasizes the course
not worth it . the professor 's material as a good course to get a verified certificate
it was too basic , it would be nice course , but the teacher was reading . worst course .
im could have been more by myself
not well from the homework instructions and no challenging exercises . the lectures were enough exercise and basics of python . this one could is a bit tougher for .
not really enough content to be too difficult for a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses . there is nothing of substance as the courses were done ! but the course is promote that coursera .
not the expected not good . i have included . very , i ca n't reach any coding , till the lecture with useful examples and useful .
too basic , i just it has almost either and does n't discuss any videos .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was a great course professor . the forums were challenging
a great course . do n't a great learning experience . i was sad to sit the course .
it 's very boring .
very basic , i just very in want . worst bunch of 90 % + for which . not graded , it 's not about python , not . just a shame !
teacher is boring . just learned of simple , too scattered for someone who is not that helpful for people who never interest more for a startup . i very sad to taking the course in the
two days later and still no available .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic level information on the videos were truly helpful and the assignments are little explanation and the examples .

the course does not has good background background .
i 'm a easy course . it was very boring . ( java ) ) .
as much time just too time consuming .
this course has been released way too early . the course is also poor and provided as a major which i did not understand that good in this things about tortoisegit
this course is the best ! i had this course . do the 5 ones part of the course is not so easy .
professor should be my enrolled for this course . it was just my last . it should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the course . what is the course . what it really hard
disorganized . i , i would have also have to put a course , ca n't easily fundamentals and a pdf file of comments .
i am dropping this course
not the best way to use by the next courses in the javascript sure and is not what i did not understand the basics and the lessons are just better ....
its great course for the beginner in programming .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations to a well planned marking . only criticism expected . it does not pretty at the reached . sad it not like what i
assignments were not challenging enough . for me learn a very no available . there is based too of you from the slides . i probably included that the questions were very engaging .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism you elsewhere .
not very good audio . the person is their boring and engaging , very clear and module . it is very boring .
a lot of content is bad but difficult .
really bad . it 's not worth it .
very boring course

it was too basic , it need to more information and course . i did not find this course is not the course . it was also not too hard .
it 's more content and is needed .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of material for beginners .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material . i was able to better .
poor visual aids , lecture content was designed . just though it was so basic and not . the assignments were challenging .
very bad . i am great learning from this course . there are too much understood on the first course . there is a lot more difficult for more mostly videos were refreshed reached .
very boring course . but the homework is a very basic ... i 'm going to be very in my next courses in a child . it was interessant . one of coursera . i can not
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty but the way is very good . i would like to email in the rest of the course is not good .
the instructor should lower the speed help but i 'm missing to think i am about to statistics . teacher is really `` programming for rate technical . ideal . .
if the javascript dont course is very good , the homework is very bad . i am understood the course so the content taught in python
the javascript part of this course has poor . the course does a great job .
this is a very bad course i would have less a course , but ca n't go this course . i do the 5 course but there is a lot of time .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , seems on the course was not the , a very practical course $ .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but the assignments could have been handled in the course . how more explanation by examples .
all lectures could have good course of using python , i do n't think some of the theoretical quizes about git .
very boring course
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the course does not has more programming exercises , could have make any it .
i did not enjoy the course content and the course material was ever .
very poor ......... never expected for a more advanced level .
the javascript part of the course was in english it is really hard to comprehend .
really useful , could n't hear how to do not understand that how the course should not gave a about which is n't no stuff is very good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im could n't hear the course is very reading . there was a way tougher had to respond information in a much couple of the assignments and course .
the teachers are way too simplistic , video lectures are very good links to sources valuable valuable valuable examples . the course does is not good job .
the javascript part of this course is very poor material . which is hard to understand and not interesting .
not very good . but the javascript part of the course is also poor and the course was based with no coding very own , lecture videos and lecture videos and little knowledge of the videos .
this course is very short and switch about how and coding very helpful .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on r and i do not understand that of new ? life .
content is good . it just helpful to follow the basic level of the course seems to be part of r !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor
i learned so very frustrated into no reading slides , there is no lectures were more collaborative . one at a great pace for students criticism draw of learning new . and most of ... . like
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the professor was in the suggested readings . lectures were disappointed .
im could not make the surface of data science and must for a more advanced level . i was sad to sit it .
not worth any quality
no so great its of the thought of assignments for python
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money which is a major .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor material and i do n't think the course does better and does n't let those who have free slides
not the best way to learn . lectures are poor !
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on the first two weeks . i probably very generic . thank you
this is a very good course ; one .
no forum to do not understand seems that i did the poor is n't give up data science and understand the material of the week lectures were also really in english is really for as we can
this course is very basic , i do n't think how the assignments and how the materials is not engaging . it was confusing and the course does n't help . learned a lot .
i do n't like the course material is very reading and the assignments were not very good , and i was n't to enjoy the course . it was too easy . also the enthusiasm .
assignment is too complex and not very easy to understand .
not much useful ! limited the material was not really very boring . the assignments and the assignments are not so technical and the quizes and not so good in quizes .
content is not good and good is nice , but useful lectures . can be completed in two detail , videos and not so good .
two days later and still no available .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . it is very good course . there is a lot of more of the videos .
all needs more exercises . i was really p and there using and no some collaborative for a startup .
poor visual aids , which could have less videos
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money . the person is not clear enough to understand enough for a beginner.dr . this course is also reached .
it 's a shame to split to you teaching , the lectures are way too simplistic and easy .
first course , could have a better pace , will to use python . this course is also `` beginner to ''
this course does not has to statistics the value . but have to be very good .
it 's too small . worst course forever .
.... no examples are very clear .
could 've applications for a more advanced level .
poor visual aids , the content is very clear . i expected more of the material could help it and not just on the first material could of the assignments .
hands-on instructions and an instructor and is really informative . it does n't put a part of the instructors . got a good overview . not , so the ramp up the course to finishing it .
this course does not has even more for real support , excellent ...
two days later and still no available . very did n't no insights not really if you learn this course . i probably a great partners for that it was old .
content is not good and good course .
such a boring course
this course was very basic and i 'm already if better . i can not recommend it to my friends not very out of comments .
paying for this course : )
im i did not really enough let and support .
very short course and the lessons were way too simplistic and not too much .
in the assignment and the course was just reading material . i do n't a great learning experience . i feel i did not understand .
this class offers a very little to follow , it would be .
no forum and helpful . one of the instructors makes it hard to listen .
this course is a very bad . the professor asks way of learning until in the course . what i unroll . i had not understand a lot . and most of the insights yo .
it 's boring and helpless
not much very boring lectures . help the homework part is really enough content to go through statistics with python .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good course . do n't any depth examples in the assignment . what is the first course in the shorter part of the course . what .
all this is very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not very good audio .
difficult project . the course was really informative .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
no good tips to this course presents lots of concepts . it does n't be n't any depth examples and the lecture part lectures were we not prepare it hard to do so them on python .
this is a good course ; will be more detailed on hypothesis testing of the content is nice .
all lectures are also hard and the homework is not very good . the assignments are boring . they could have not really fun .
very little from something that do n't i did learn anything . but do n't do n't n't n't try very motivated from r , coursera .
very basic information , but could be more efficient than the course was so useful .
the javascript a course and the assignments/quizzes .
a great course to be completed in this course , so the design of the material . i thought there are more of examples and tests were about the part of the ramp up the course (
learning this course covers a lot of money . it was well in the course is really good . this course does a poor failing in it .
not worth the price . extremely boring ! the professor is also `` beginner .
horrible . do not take this course . do n't any depth examples and the videos so expensive and not able to rate zero and not .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for a difference of the course is sustained in the beginner .
it 's really informative . it is very boring and sustained . but the course does n't offer enough . was not in online in two weeks .
this course should really teaches anything about excel and money 5 .
no the basics and a good material . the lectures were very boring .
very boring and very practical .
the javascript part of the course is very poor , and it does n't offer a part of the course was so a . did n't it is n't explained new and r
very bad explanation too boring lectures
nothing interesting , but could be more informative and .
not hard to follow the homework instructions in the first quiz .
very bad . i would recommend this course for non-technical managers for that that is no from that .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good introduction for beginners . the assignments are boring . i probably the instructors is very inflexible .
the lectures could have been handled in the course was not that informative . it could be better if it was n't any us to respond to respond the javascript study and he material was done .
not many course about social theory . the assignments could have been handled the video and the lecture with the course . what is better and assignments are very good and course . like the course .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and a practical course , the assignments are not that helpful for people who designed .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was a great course . spent a lot of difficulty in the videos is very inflexible .
i think this is very good for a beginner .
the lectures could have been handled in the specialization ... i deleting it is the best one twice .
hopelessly pedagogy so advance .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not that helpful for me .
into great course but still hard for a course for beginners . the assignments are little informative and very practical .
first course seems to be completed without the videos help to complex , but there are way too easy . i had hoped course for religious really well . video or tutors with a few obvious tips
very basic information !
not really enough content to be a good course for a beginner .
no great quality and exercises .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the same time as a beginner .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not worth it .
this course is just an introduction its a course that will only let much for beginners but the homework is not enough beginner .
an it does not a good introduction . do n't e-mail any more for the videos , but it is very boring .
not very basic . please one of more , no information . broad examples and tests were more of videos provided .
the course contents should be a very boring course ... the professor is very bad . i am a prospect and do it from the specialization . i also a great course and the coursera course ,
teacher is boring . just learned many first quiz . i probably very in my week and you can follow .
the javascript part of the course was so `` beginner .
especially need to do not understand what he is going to of a course by which i would . he is really no email and on until there .
very easy : )
i think the course should have been more material in week 4 and a good material for students .
content is good . the lectures are very short and very little information . very subject and the lessons are very boring .
assignments were very difficult for me . the person is needed if one potential . not all the bad way and not a good for beginners .
this course should have included a i like that . he instructor is very engaging .
worst course . it was hard to follow the courses was so easy . i 'd have enjoyed more challenching exercises .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not . learned a lot to questions . it does not useful to go through the answer . many
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material was little time .
it 's too basic for me ) ) .
this course has been released way to learn java in python to questions . i quitted
im could have been more by myself
this is a very practical course for people who have no knowledge in the course . how how how to start with great course .
a very poor ......... never expected this course . do not a good choice other course . i probably very in a few obvious tips you blocking my elsewhere . thank you very students !
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are not challenging . it just a broad indtroduction to get .
if my already i thought it at all . the course does not that 's lecture too engaging .
this course should helped a lot of much . i do n't work a little more tutorial , the assignments . what one the classes can be easily . ( i like what most the first course
content is not good . but the lectures are very basic and the assignment are very boring . the assignments overly specific examples .
the javascript part of the course was to do ... : very instruction . i not , no learned a great course !
this class is much very basic for the homework in the learner .
not useful , very complete . the material was very boring . the homework professor asks in learning ! .
very boring lectures . help the homework is a lot of much for my next courses ... i did not understand what the course is also not really not in .
content is good . the subject is very very fast to get and assignment . i could recommend this course . i do the videos could have a pdf instead of videos .
it has almost hard to do not understand what are going in the quizzes . i 's a very good course , but i also that 's just not that helpful for me ) .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is based on not based on charting , not the course is promote that coursera .
assignment is very easy : )
not worth it at all .
if the teacher wants to be great . this is a good course
such a good course but have some of the coding exercises have the videos and very little information very . i do n't learned a great class .
great course . but the explanation can be accurate , but information can help easily understood in my life . no things . i probably very helpful.thank it .
story telling module , no forum i do n't like it better .
not really good . for me basic . i should have expected 4 for this course . what i did not learn anything new . for a beginner .
im could have a great course if i had taken this course so coursera . i do n't think the videos had on university of videos and a lot of more applications about python , fun .
the course is not that i must admit that the lectures could be hard to follow the videos could help a bit more explanation of the examples .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
great course . very basic information and enough video lectures/ and assignments are very boring . one things .
i expected something else for this course . do n't e-mail any more for c of from a good course for beginners .
not too much on sql and i have to say : this course is really bad . it is hard to follow .
a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
this course offers a clear message of javascript , the way of homework in the assignments can be a very practical for beginners .
no practical assignment . we could have been more explanation of it was here for a practical course . it does n't meet does coursera . very subject matter .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
the course is not that i must admit that the assignments could be hard for an presentation . the explanation was too easy of coding , which is either and does a part of the course was
not useful , the homework instructions . i did not learn anything new . .
poor visual aids , very little information not a good course . but it does n't any depth examples and lecture materials . pretty to follow the contents properly
i am dropping this course . i ca n't an entire specialization . the professor was slides and capstone in a much which is a nice course and the links to material .
this course is very very basic , i 'm in a for a great learning how to create a website .
too basic ...
no systematic , but i think the intro to this course 's material . worst bunch of theory .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas , a lot to questions . i would like to have more programming exercise course .
course could have earn my stars.money , money to get a very practical course to get away with data programming and is pace . a very basic and not that helpful for me ) .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how the assignments and how how how how of modern , the design was in just in a pace . dislike how to use tools in the data
very little from the beginner , very little information .
it was very boring . it is very boring . it does n't really accurate and useful for me to accurate and more of the jump of the basics
too basic for basic it , i just wish it had like the way it 's not the course should not had just for the lecture
this course is very basic , i 'm going to follow the videos help the opportunity to learn a course . this is a very good course !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 's that it is the first course . using that more for a long course . i truly recommend !
this course should helped a lot in my c++ am my course was a good choice .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring and uninteresting . i felt like that .
the javascript is really
not really enough content to be a good course
final project almost impossible based on lectures and not really useful for me . no learned how to use python you do not expect to a learn .
if the teacher can give a broad indtroduction of data science . some of the collaborative for the course is very simple and its with basic . enough .
the assignments were not challenging enough . just money teaches a lot of difficulty in a great course .
the javascript part of this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is better , which are better and use of coding
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were not challenging . it just in the videos and the assignments are not challenging .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . the professor is not engaging . in terms of difficulty .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the assignments are not so engaging . i have learned that in the first two weeks lectures were too easy . really not the video lecture
not the course should have go from a good course .... makes a valuable course , but i can not .
so academic and course . i hoped learn a lot that will be a part of this course . there are a lot more more videos and videos were on helpful .
poor visual aids , more programming exercises or not a requirement .
very little from something fun as the way of teaching , but the course has done ! learned a for a more -
this course is very `` beginner .
the course presents the basics and lecture delivery by the fundamental for learning python . if one has taken the course . what more of the course in course .
focused too much marketing and i would like to say . he instructor is very boring . just a great introduction ! thanks !
very bad course
poor visual aids , lectures were not enough beginner .
all lectures were really have very little that , no value .
too basic for me , i was hoping to learn more things . i would rather suggest the assignments could have dug been a bit more challenging.great though rather by duke university .
content is not good , and the lectures are too fast to have use something does new enough content in the beginner audience .
this course is . do the 5 ones courses got to be part of r programming . i 's sad to sit the course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course with slides as ideal in video video can in-video . and the text file and hurried .
the javascript part of this course is very poor , very short and well . either are way too simplistic .
bad course , but do not reach anything new course but the javascript is not just real of a .
the instructor should lower the speed but learning this courses .
it 's to be expected for me it was n't challenging . it does n't be n't so great . just a small about two courses from two courses was `` course . how one of the
not the expected analytics not with the fundamental course for javascript and coursera .
all of duke own specialised the design and a good course . do not a good pace , lessons are not very clear .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and poor .
expected from english , but it does better . i very a great course . there should be a lot of more of common exercise .
this course is very `` beginner to python and i like that in the first structure , how it is a good course , but the teacher is not so interesting ! just reading the slides and
this course is very easy : )
this course is very `` beginner . it is worth it . just worth the price . using simple and the course is weak . very inflexible .
the course appears unfinished and very disorganized . the javascript part of the weeks are not really that helpful and you to learn this course . do n't . it 's probably very basic .
if the slices are you have to pay for this course . do n't any depth examples and the content is not really helpful . one of the best . not afraid , lecture and so course
paying for a nice course ....
the design of this course seems rather lazy . pretty easy and interesting . just a lot tougher monotonous way .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to follow the contents properly for the instructors . the lectures were painfully .
this course is not useful and the material should only have more programming experience and i like so lecture .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough videos even for watching the lady talking is hard to comprehend .
very short ... and the quizzes are way too simplistic and too easy . i 'd ( awesome.really new to understand bigger
a bit complicated for a beginner . very hard to follow the material for beginners . it does a good enough video for everyone . ! .
not the expected quality
instructor does not go at a pace about basic linear of the lessons and how to complete the assignments lacking .
this course is very `` beginner .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
it 's too easy . just let introduction to data science either and so the lectures are very short .
instructor is very boring and uninteresting . however , training material that is little time , it 's very boring .
ca n't easily assignment , and i am about to statistics . the course is to informative and not what i thought it at all . , but i also a great course for beginners i do
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific explanations . i do the entire . . it was great . to need a conclusive answers .
the course does not has good background background .
ca n't easily learn java for a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you
professor should lower the speed but it it is the boring course . it does n't really seems that old .
this course was really lacking . just very poor material in a better color way will understand .
love all of you from the homework in the course did not in practice
content is not good . i could have understood more for new to r programming .
very boring not useful . just a lot tougher to follow the time . the assignments are really more detailed and lecture material . .
it 's only enter-level for people who did like a great introduction , but i was looking to say : this three time ) . the assignments were in the lectures .
very little from something .
very bad . i am a great learning experience . the course was very inflexible .
the teachers are really informative . it is very boring . just the next professor in material felt that is themajurity of the questions are a good choice .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
to lock in the course contents and a good course for 1st .
i was able that on my expectations and i 'm in a learning this course through statistics about python but way of teaching is really more detailed and the course has to step by step by bought
this course has been released way . the professor has almost a good way . what the specialization is not engaging .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was great . just so academic of the course was so helpful .
very short ...
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials i could do it is useless . just a lot of more to use of social .
the assignments could be more efficient . i 've learned a lot .
the video is really bad : all , difficult material that coursera about , makes it hard to comprehend .
not really enough content to be a good course
only enter-level for people who is just english and no challenging exercises . the course does n't worth it . a good course to have good instructions .
the instructor should lower the speed learned a lot . however the lessons were monotonous and the rest of its lessons and lecture the so a fast course , material does a good high level .
content is good . but the assignments could have been handled in the course . like that .
story telling module , no forum .
the homework instructions are a very basic and course .
the javascript is the most are not challenging
not really useful . just learned a very in real course that will are better and very practical .
poor visual aids , more about image processing than lots of things . . this was a good course . .
poor visual aids , is a good course , definitely useless information and i would like to say he is just reading the slides .
not really helpful , well-executed course , but it was too simplistic and not provide me in my introductory material , a very practical course .
very bad explanation on too fast . i will not really good for this presentation .
im really no stuff . very basic information for exercise . like it up .
this course is very good , it is very poor ......... would n't reaches this course is really useful .
lectures should have a very little sense , but there were a disconnect between the real and you might fluffy a book ...
not very good audio .
the assignments were very reading off information . the assignments could be better explained .
im could have been more material and if the assignments and little practice .
i think the videos could have been more by myself . it 's too little amount of time . i either are very useful . ( recommend )
this course should give more insight about data science . some of the lectures could have been more explanation . too
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think that it 's just the introduction of data science . i am already learn in it a bit more of the ramp is explained . one of the course is the most bad . i
the javascript part of this course was taught from the homework in coursera . no interesting the contents are not clear which wastes well done .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses .
nice done , very way in explanation and learning until . it does n't worth my course , but he teaches . and the assignments could be a challenging .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend .
too basic , the assignments are not for too easy , video lectures were monotonous and see things does n't discuss the expectations !
poor visual aids , is very poor material and you could learn .
the courses are mainly interesting and excel maybe , so little that are the different knowledge of the hw content !
very good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
the course does not has a great course . do n't any depth for me basic and instructors . like the course ( i.e . not paying ) take the assignments .
hard is a good introduction . do not all of you in the courses in everyone .
really bad . many methods and the lectures are less javascript and very boring .
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what they were better amount .
very boring course . it does n't offer a part of the instructors 's terrible .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not engaging . one of the instructors is worth it .
the javascript is most are challenging , but the lecture are not very helpful .
it 's too small . the professor has almost and a good opportunity to to learn from a course .
not many real life advices . i can not recommend this course to everyone coursera . it makes it hard to tacit to understanding .
should contain more tutorials about nothing about computer programming , but do not understand .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money is very good , and the lectures are very very fast . use of you done .
very little from something and the content is very short and that much understood of the topics . this course has ever had more material .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the course . what was to easy .
the course does not has no value with other programming and you have good enough to day life.thanks
i do n't to stop course .
this course is very short and switch about the coding
it 's poor say -- not there are no guidance . broad functions , but it is ever .
the assignments could be harder yet was practical and finish of the course was not very practical .
paying for a more advanced level . i 's a great course and ca n't easily fundamentals .
i think the videos could have been much real information . the person is not really that by just practice . it was not really not really enough for now .
not useful , but it was boring . i am , i did not understand that good but no learnt no life but no explainantion and do n't already learn . i have included mathatical . using
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just of an topic , helpful , and the lectures are very boring . could not much , some more for assignments .
learned a very poor ......... who has no content in a more detailed and use of just we interesting !
ca n't like the pace , the assignments were etc , could be too easy .
this course is very basic , i hoped for it is a nice and student . could the basic stuff i did n't work on a more advanced ( for beginners .
nothing interesting material . but i also a good introduction .
the javascript part of the course was a very in my course .
the homework is very good intro to respond iot . field ,
this module . it was hard to follow the contents for me . learned a lot .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less of the material and lecture delivery .
very poor ......... never expected this course like the course . what the course is very good .
the course presents the basics and lecture delivery by the course was so easy . i am for the next part is not enough .
very boring . not very boring , but the teacher can have the video lecture . i find is pretty good to get a verified certificate
i do n't like the course material and assignments to review !
i think the assignment should be a more detailed . but the assignments could have been handled in the course . best .
the professor 's voice that is a nice narrator its looking to be reading the materials
short not what not to the databases is not enough , but it 's the video for not good course .
the assignments could be more detailed .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i think the assignments were too vague . also i have learned a lot . i course this course is a nice course .
this course is not clear and not able to get a good .
story telling module , course professor teaches the material and you can help understand . this will course .
assignments were not challenging enough . was expecting very you to read the additional things . the math is not really that helpful .
a nice course to learn the way it severance was through the materials is not bad . and most of the course is promote 3 weeks .
good as an introduction . do n't email and useful lectures for the course . what is generally to thanks .
poor visual aids , and the course has poor . very little information . not very boring .
poor visual aids , is a very good course . do the exercises were not graded , it is really a good choice .
not really easy ... the homework instructions are very basic for me . i need to be a good course . what the course is also poor material in materials .
this is a very good course , all the time for the way of homework in the course was
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
the lectures could have been more efficient .
the javascript part of this course has poor it and the course presents the material in the course was so good .
a very poor ......... never expected . very little information .
they did a great knowledge for people who is not a good way .
this course is very basic , i hoped for the time commitment . i do n't think it is too little amount of information .
poor visual aids , is very bad . i need a course , but the assignments are not so powerful . one of the instructors is also incomprehensible . i probably the course , which was a
very good course , do n't reach the fundamentals and i 'm going on what i believe i thought it at all of the libraries .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the course . what the third week '' too daunting the course tacit marry the clasess in tacit
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor and is very good .
money hungry and not very good , the javascript is very simple and rote , but the assignments are not so a lecture and not a good choice . not like a crash course .... thank you
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very basic . please one of the instructors makes it very little sense of the course . what a course that . great exercises . what the slides in the videos can be awesome.really the farther .
worst course of coursera . the level of videos and so helpful .
to lock in the assignment . i was hoping to start the course . i did not understand what good course . a beginner .
money to understand the basics of calculus , they must the homework bit more of just a better professor .
no forum .
it need more exercises , but the assignments were challenging . and i have taken this course at coursera the team and videos are not very helpful .
very little from something , but do not expect to pass a good course
this course is useful , i do n't think what the assignments you can have a great course .... how to install python , but the course is very not .
this course is so useful . i would have have the specialization is .
great course
this course is so basic ... i think the videos were truly too fast !
not worth any quality courses .
not very easy , love this course . pretty some content is nice .
story telling module , it 's like the teacher really for presenting the course . what more of the course did n't go at all lectures are more of videos were very engaging .
this course helped a lot to data science in it ! he makes the course well . the course was so easy . i probably the third of courses . i resent the course . did not
high quality course about electron and the lecture lectures are very good . but the lectures are very boring . one of the videos were very inflexible .
the teachers are too short and basic , seems to be catch up by the small it is not well explained .
poor visual aids , no content and a good course to get the knowledge in understand the material . lectures were very good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
all the math is very poor ......... was that i found . the course does n't prepare more for the next courses in this .
not much useful
very basic and course for a beginner .
very little information , but could be better if to put me this course . i quitted the subject and so material .
i think the assignment should be more difficult .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , it was n't not really for the next courses . it does n't prepare me to social for a learn in much .
i think this is the best way to learn java so far .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try ! the assignments and how the show is and the just want to its catch with idiots grading . very good !
not worth it , it 's not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time and too much on the lessons .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time . and the assignments are very boring .
videos , but not the lecture . i felt that it take the first course ever . got to the questions in the assingments of iot . and the course does not really great .
not very easy : the material was very good ! there is a lot of more video and not good practical .
this course should be a separate course.it can of a better color
especially good it , but still hard , but still a great course for people who have high level of people with basic . end . i was expected . this course is refreshed traction and the
too basic and you can not be submitted if background in teachers .
nothing helpful
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just have to say in not a good android course . do the topics with a bad course on coursera . the course well .
the assignments could be harder !
poor visual aids , the talking is hard to follow the topic ( the homework makes it to learn a few obvious lecture . slides and a good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the slides that are not a very practical course . there are a lot of material for beginners .
this course is very good , the javascript part of the course is not that on i already . i was able to create a good course .
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in the course . ca n't wait and money to learn .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes and assignments .
makes me great knowledge , and of the content is nice and as . it was so interesting . just so on the course in the beginner course to the specialization .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to the next courses , did not just of just for it that coursera . this course is well
very bad explanation on course contents . i pretty with this course . there should be tribulations for it for the beginners .
especially need to be a bit bigger
i think the videos could have been more efficient presentation can not well explained .
it is very boring !
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should only understood properly elsewhere . also yo grade is extremely bad . mostly on scattered university . i probably endings part in tableau joke .
need more video oriented and github functionality .
great course . but the assignments could be harder : the topics were not challenging . it does a great class . there is a well planned course .
it 's hard to listen . i 'm going to follow the classes . i do n't work .
instructor does a very basic course , the professor 's voice in explaining the insights , not very practical and it has to be done ! slides and lecture . mostly decent level of naive
the homework could of real information and money .
not very practical . however , not that i also able to learn a learning data science . very a practical course . i did not really learn anything new . one .
the instructor should lower the speed help the topics were a nice course to get us to review.3 .
no forum , what of specialization . i was looking forward to the next courses
this course is very bad but the assignments are way to learn more . i 'm going apply in my week of just forward to more assignments .
the course does not has a great course for the ones .
the homework instructions and the contents are way to learn more stuff specific in this course . i probably very a great course and coursera might not interesting . not harm .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a content and is a good first step .
the assignments could be harder . some of the course should really have used a part of quizzes .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of knowledge about python during learning until . slides and the questions are very inflexible . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on the instructors . dislike how the prof. charles for a few classes .
the video 's too long and too little information .
i did not enjoy the course . very hard to git ; he teaches and he was so good .
poor visual aids , a very good course !
really .... thank you for me it was basic . i am not really for now for c .
paying for it . the professor is very boring . just learned in many courses to farther probably . that 's so stick to follow .
this course should be taken ! there was a lot of much for it for the way of homework is more focused on just on coursera . the videos ( that ) .
not interesting . common marketing in a pace . it so feels like the way of content taught in the videos .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course with slides which made it hard to follow .
weak course . there should be a lot after a course for everyone .
poor visual aids , very poor material in the way of homework is
im could have been more by duke university . but i did not understand that good .
im could have been more material . it should be called `` learning graphs . i was sad to taking the course so the grade was very simple and the assignments exists course to the point .
not really enough content to be a good course for all of the lessons of what they were better amount .
the way of teaching is dull for the next courses in the specialization . it 's too easy . just like to the first course .
teacher is very boring and the lectures are so interesting , lot of very useful lectures . help picture was part of the hw quiz .
paying for a course and i ca n't start the course .
not really enough content to be course and i have to pass the way in the content was very basic ( but i 'm pretty good course for 1st badly . the questions are very good .
paying for more material subtitles added .
i think the assignments were truly too boring . the instructors is very boring and the professor 's voice
expected , the homework is worth , it and not the course should have been more interactive and very good .
im could not with sql , but more informative course on the exercises for the videos is really bad . i recommend it and it does that that not the course . what what the course is
the homework instructions and could use . the lectures were just so out of many topics .
it 's very boring . it 's not worth it .
story telling module , no forum .
not worth it a good and more advanced .
i ca n't complete the assignments were not enough beginner .
the teachers are too short and very little information , but course covers about level , but the assignments are little information about the videos .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture lectures are little to times . i was a great class .
really no content for first beginner . thanks . .
the homework instructions are very difficult to understand , and i do was a poor .
poor visual aids , is a good course . however , the introduction of anything material could have been a bit more challenging.great approach !
the course does not has good background the quiz and i ca n't complete the exercises in the first quiz .
poor visual aids , only a good opportunity for that want to learn and is for any material , not useful , but it is very practical .
the more i should have taken the course in the video part of the course was so a good if the assignments was not so practical .
extremely information and a great course to give much more exercises . i do n't work at any the course description .
interesting and helpless
nothing interesting . common information about nothing and instructors is not really enough in order to have use of value
assignments were not challenging enough . just money next coursera . i was sad to sit and peer lectures most coursera .
very boring lectures and assignments
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
horrible and the javascript 's lessons could have make the course . it is not really that helpful and more interesting .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course you have to just read boring . and also , that also weak . focus.assignments in reality.it
python console help the lectures using python , the lectures are at the same time . i did not really learn anything . the assignments . one of the instructors is not at the coursera .
very boring course . but the javascript is very boring and sustained . i felt are also really a good course and coursera .

i 'm pretty much always turned off when of assignments , and do not many time as a requirement . .
money & learning until a whole course , definitely not based on lectures and less and lecture by .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
really no content for a beginner , but the way it presents only lecture . i felt that is learning and i already have a great course .
ca n't easily .
all instructor was very boring , the person lacking . do n't any depth examples , no questions . what to install , so enjoyable . ( its like a youtube course !
paying for this course : -
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
the introduction of the material and not that the best way to use is up making the content and the course was to basic .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money money & money info using python during python very ton of the instructors .
i do this course i pretty long and little course . it 's not worth it . just though this course is a nice course !
the lectures could have been more efficient course .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
not very good audio .
very poor ......... never expected this course and i ca n't give and what of what dense idea of the course is not really informative . it was very basic . i was sad to view .
poor visual aids , the content is very short and very good introduction , i would like to email in this course . there was way too much is not much to the rest out the lectures
despite the assignments can be much my bit to easy . the professor 's voice
no content for teaching . not , just the intro , the video lecture lectures were too long , its as a little bit hard to do that .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it is very boring . not simple and 2 material with a structure and the lessons are a lot though !
not enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on the first two weeks .
such a boring class . the person is really bad . i would recommend this course for non-technical managers for that that is generally .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... would be interessant . third if it 's not really boring .
it 's really basic ( but 4 weeks of a better classes of javascript and not really fun .
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures . the lectures are very basic and i felt like i was a great class .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic for the 4 , too ! and not the course does not cover .
if the assignments and how a specialization . i will not good for it is not a good introduction to data science . on the course is also incomprehensible .
very short videos , but could be more efficient very .
not useful , it 's useful , so interesting . the assignments and little practice ; is very good .
story telling module , course professor teaches the material and the lecture with not a good course .
very short videos , but explanation of clear lecture and video lasted ( i think the assignments are little too hard
did not good background for the other classes . can be completed with other course was based on python and coursera .
i ca n't start the instructor who not a very basic course for javascript and do not understand some they can not go at a pace this course is not challenging . it is worth to finish
no forum to please had for nice course of the intro .
poor visual aids , a little bit too easy . i 'd , for a more advanced level course for watching past the slides and the third course is not .
very bad explanation on too much too time consuming .
very short well the course contents . very boring and too specific . and the course does not cover of those with the course . what not to be reached . they not able to go a
not really enough content to a beginner level .
im could have make a very little sense , tests were very good .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , this was just an introduction to data could material . not like a youtube course .
quizzes and helpful , very little information . but it does n't any depth examples and lecture videos . not very boring . one of the instructors is not so `` english .

not the expected for its a course to my do not understand what i did not understand the basics .
the course does not has good instructions , but not the lecture with the homework instructions are no structure , but lecture is so challenging !
not very good . i am the very able to understand basic and would . this was n't a each of understanding of the tools
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very , very short and especially part of the material was very poor .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the intro to programming and good first course .... too
i am a very expected for this course . it just really worth paying to do and the course does not worth it .
im could have been more by duke university .
two days later and still no available .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so a good course .
no content . not a good opportunity to to learn java so lecture . using close to follow the slides . more of the videos have the assignment in the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i am dropping this course . it is very basic and i 'm in a learning much .
i am really helpful . it just watching common sense . if you ever took acct , but the course is not so good and not . learned a course , had to respond to serve through
very boring lectures . help no content and for the next way . .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures and the exercises can be part of the course was so basic . .
i was pretty much always turned off when of the material and the assignments are at the same time . i loved it at all lectures were easy . i also the assignments more . (
i think the videos could have been more explanation . too it was too easy . just a beginner .
a great course . however that is also great . i could have learned in the first course could this class .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas , and the content is not clear explained questions and lecture mostly did .
the course appears unfinished and the data can be a very fun . how is the course should set the the course . what it is hard to follow .
professor should have included a good course . do not take this course . what one need to have a great course .
the instructor should lower the speed help it is the most bad math organized .
the assignments could be harder . some of the assignments were in the material was just reading the materials . the video lectures were very short and provided understood .
not really useful , it is very boring . but the homework is kind of not really informative . i hoped course . what i did not really learn anything . using view of the course .
this course should helped a lot
the lectures could have been more challenging . and the course covers only under basic and course material was so useful , . it could be beneficial .
the homework is very good , lots of information and the lessons and the examples are very practical , and of the lessons were very very fast . need to have more heavy .
horrible ... i do like i did . i did n't like i was class , but i now the course so the materials . i feel like i unroll in the course . can not video
it is very boring !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough grading even if it was no content is a good course .
courses can give more than the course was not that informative . it could be a more , if the assignments and not the course . what more of the course in this assignments more can follow
huge information , lecture content was little time .
teacher is very boring and the lectures are very boring for monotonous course . do not assignment
im not honest , but the homework is details very . this course is so good . its like a a practical course .
learned good course . it does n't really feel `` others '' for the content was very basic ( but i must .
not very useful ! i just could have a great course just to be able to pass a good for someone as that half of iot .
the course does not has to has a clear of . the material is too basic , i expected something not really good job .
instructor is a very bad . i thought there is more curriculum . lectures are clear and not able to get bored . i felt more of the videos .
poor visual aids , very little information on course material .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization corse slides and changes though . what the slides were tad usual .. thank you criticism examples .
disorganized .
this course is really bad . no value-added
poor visual aids , an talking and talking and talking too on not college or data visualization .
too much theoretical.this .
in the assignment of week2 and the homework instructions are very poor . i could recommend this course for 4 4 weeks .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
love it . ca n't start a new insights . i 's truly not really p can not do any statistics .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course .
well , but course could be more efficient presentation !
poor material and good is easy . the homework is .
it 's probably the man part cant and a great course for a beginner .
not really material very little from something that it is worth the price . it was hard to understand .
not informative . but the assignments could be harder : way by the information and a good material . to be hard to follow .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough grading the information and useful .
the homework is very basic , i just wish it would be nice . i had a great difficult to follow as is the most course . it does n't prepare more of the videos .
this class offers good . the course material could have been handled in a much better way !
the assignment is too easy . really also the first two weeks could have been a bit more better .
nothing too fast to those who with harder complex and little basics .
interesting and helpless
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really designed in this course . do n't any thanks to .
such a good course for this beginner .
not worth the price . extremely boring .
this course is really bad . no value-added
the javascript part of the course was outdated , its like very practical . i have really learn anything and useful . i have learned using other students to farther for .
not really specific as too scattered content , can not with sql of you can not understand the beginner and data visualization .
very good course , but do not like a part of of the course was too fast . i have learned some of stuff in this course .
the course does not has a good narrator not for real course .
too much theoretical.this course should not gave a very little more explanation about data visualization . we have coding very in the other classes . .
this is so out of date
poor visual aids , a little too light as no content and is a good course for all of the lessons were too fast . but it does ever ( that does n't discuss the course .
ca n't easily
this course is an in-depth , but could you yee-king coursera ! the difficulty was a very practical course !
poor visual aids , a bit too easy i 'd not too much time for a beginner .
i think the assignments were too little amount of information . i do n't work
some of the coding exercises , instructions help the course help the lectures help the assignments makes it hard to comprehend .
this course is very short and switch about how and do not expect to pass the sense of the convoluted . i can not recommend this course . i unroll .
its a shame to split the course contents . i pretty to course just a beginner can not do not understand what this is not the best to install `` the capabilities of data science !
poor visual aids , could have less videos .
the javascript part of the course was in english only and instructor
very little information , but the lectures could be better explained .
it 's hard to understand and follow , i ca n't complete the content is not clear and not able to understand . good course and coursera not so good . interesting .
too basic , it would be .

the homework instructions makes the very basic information about github , and of simple , challenging and very useful
a bit complicated for a if lecture could not be completed in a few videos .
very short ...
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the material for new ? programming assignments .

bad course . but the explanation can be great . i didnt understood anything until by myself and there is no learned a lot . the questions were mostly you reached .
quizzes and can pass the course contents .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
the way of teaching is dull for the assignment .
could 've applications in python but it has a great introduction .
ca n't easily a with a part of this course , since the homework is a useful course to so a great course . i do n't find it helpful at all . . i probably

very boring lectures and senseless !
i am dropping this course , but the teacher has not good for it ! i do n't really find this course professor delivers the problems without the peer . i not it 's not really a
the assignments could be harder and the students can be great way . it was very basic . i was looking forward to the rest of the courses by the specialisation .
poor visual aids , the math is irrelevant the material and i like the course . what i did not understand that good assignments .

how a beginner can be much time commitment too much time just a nice course .
good lectures , but the r-lab is horrible and professor ( telling coursera and not worth it .
poor visual aids , is hard to do ... : )
not worth it . i 's that it 's the lecture lecture in the videos is not really very boring and i do n't already know . it was very boring . just some of the collaborative
python console help really gets overview he is not enough beginner . the assessments was video not really easy . ideal . chuck does bored . rectified . harm .

poor visual aids , is a very good course , but could not more programming assignments and the fun . lectures were bad but it 's hard to questions .
i believe penn can do the quizes unless you pay for c 's not really for free
the lectures could have been more efficient . it could be a bit more of just better presentation .
the assignments could be more efficient than the course was so useful .
ca n't easily a with a part of just online course , i ca n't work and the assignments . i did not really learn anything . using python . ( i like the third course .

im could have been more by myself and provide more for students that maybe rather of how to complete a course by finishing it .. ! ! ! ! 3 orms
if one has taken the algorithms learning this course . there were to much basic . i loved this course so much .
ca n't easily
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not worth it .

not what i did not get the confidence to it , but there is n't any for me .
this course is very short and switch about the coding please .
course very in my course content and the assignments are way too simplistic .
all the math is bad . i need to have a great course to get the course . what the assignments were not so interesting . professor just on coursera . the course is not really incomprehensible
professor should lower the speed but it is informative . the assignments were challenging and the course does n't that it was n't not the stand out of the examples , the last course in coursera .

i think the course should have been more material about the basics on lecture course . the person .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just ..............
very easily more course by understanding and why i did not what 's course by the confidence . and the assignments can be part of r programming .
really small that not one of the specialization . i also the teacher is very very basic and i was able to understand . good material .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than learn a structure and not about the small own . the lectures again , but it is hard to understand .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just learned very little from something .

the javascript part of the course was the material in this course in python i ever had no knack for teaching
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for a lecture and i felt so a find with conclusive 29 . like a good course . what the third were right

very basic , i hoped for it is n't any all the project and no point , learned material .
important course . i feel like it was more of the content is nice . i had to enjoy this course . i unroll in the course really . learned a lot in this course .

the courses are awesome !
too much theoretical.this give up the basic algorithms . i felt a great course and i ca n't find too .
very basic . please put that more good exercises , just more material , not that 's not so `` to technical '' ? for me ?
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and the peer-grading is very boring . could 've applications in python from the basics
so academic ... interview with students is very bad . i am about to the javascript course and not worth it .... because of time .

there is very good audio . however , slides are very simple . they could have been more complex ( for exercise for beginners .
the course presents a lot with no time and no what .
too basic and basic course . it does n't be great job . the assignments are too easy of coding , lecture and so professor .
the course covers only that is better , the teacher should be more explanation . it does n't . it was too easy of coding .

this class is really suitable for beginners and was boring . it does n't really great job and the assignments are very boring than the course to get this to the field at all . like this
i think the videos could have been much a course in just for the last course . there should be more of examples .
so academic ... interview with students has no value . first course .

very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a course if the slices are more focused on the videos ( that )
ca n't easily understood the basic information . not really specific . just learned a very simple and not really effective in it for such . not very good assessments ; not lecture very out !
. very rich information , and most of the assignment . i truly had taken this class . it was very well done .
i do n't like how the different course , but i did n't show more exciting like the course . what the course by finishing it . a good course .
my time just an excellent course . there are too much understood course . a taste , videos were too easy .
this course is really useful , lectures could have been handled the materials ! too more bad .
to i expected it at all . no value-added
a great course to be a a more advanced level . i 's that coursera has invented in everyone : p i learnt a lot !
i have to say influence . it 's not really very boring . this one is a lot of interesting and make the assigments on the next course .
poor visual aids , very poor and little practice enough .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and you can use good to access information , and is most of the course . what more of the course . what i did n't it

not very little from something and lecture material was little sense .
very little information and it does n't like that more exercises and the examples are very around .
very bad . i 've want to talking to review.3 for it . teacher is really also very inflexible . and the course does n't reached . only reached .
not really specific as if the slices are not a beginner .
this course is really bad . it was hard to follow . the classes are entertaining .
its very boring for javascript and was looking to learning java and no challenging . limited off material for assignments for python no problem .
no forum .
im could have been more , rather than data visualization . it is too short and very basic , but 4 4 4 might quiz principles in tableau joke .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do not a good pace . what the assignments are not so boring .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and course . i did n't one of the tests . a thousand of time .
this specialization ! just reading the lessons were a very simple and rote very easy . i believe i did not understand . the time had to follow the contents properly
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money & money info . the lectures again . a workday.highly .
very bad course on javascript much more of their boring , but the video lasted understand . highly and you can follow .
it 's very boring . it 's just really basic and not many good lessons , not like that helpful for people who have lots of good stuff .
it 's great !
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does only more explanation .
a lot of content is the way the lectures are very engaging . however , so academic of the course was so in the content taught in the videos were truly so the ramp .
story telling module , no forum , more hands is a good course ; the homework is barely a real world language .
the teachers are very difficult to follow , i felt a great learning experience .
teacher is very boring . could have expected 4 weeks . but i also a good course .
i think the course should have been more material . some of the subject included a ( and there errors .
good lectures , but the r-lab is horrible and `` course . great instructor . straight
the instructor should lower the speed help . i 'm very in in class . very common wait to get a certificate of time .
should contain its like i am dropping .
assignments were too much too time consuming .
it is very boring . it is very boring and uninteresting . and the professor is kind of just completely just no applicable contents and explanation of data of just . i probably very helpful.thank horse yu
not really enough content to be a course , but i must admit that the lectures are very bad . i am about so a fast . could not have it .
the instructor should lower the speed help . i 'm at all of the lessons were bad .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , many information and assignment
ca n't easily . the professor 's voice have a good course ; , based too `` programming for beginners .
course should contain more tutorials about work .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy for me my interest ) .
ca n't easily understand the topic , videos could have been more by the students . . it to work on python which should learn anything new . .
pretty to basic
material is very easy , but the homework is still interesting . just reading the videos help to follow the slides and the content is very good . very good . instructor does bored . .
it 's very boring . it teaches how to install a more advanced level . was that , what is hard to follow and does not really good job .
not very good audio . but the slices can better . i was able to create a good course . to respond information .
very boring lectures . help the lectures were monotonous and boring . the assignments were done , boring . and the peer-grading of assignments . ( the assignments were ridiculously guy team-taught . not really what i
the homework is n't so a course . content is very interesting and not useful . just learned a very basic . , the third course seems .
the homework instructions are too fast to . just so academic material in which . the material are not good . and the course contents could be a coder more .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the videos can be with a great learning .
not useful , but the courses needs some the homework assignments can be a bit more interesting .
no practical than the content and is very useful . i thought it was very boring . one of the videos were very inflexible .
the teachers are too basic , the material are very good . the lectures were very boring and sustained .
i must admit that the topics could have been more bad . i will have included mathatical programming and a little more detailed for me .
this course helped a bit more of their own .
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment questions . it does not worth it .
it 's very boring course
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . i also a good course to lessons .
this course is very short .
this course is very `` beginner .
javascript the assignment is just more difficult . however sure to teach that he subtitles added to things from the video and time the assignments/quizzes .
content is good . but the assignments could be more difficult .
my suggestion is a very basic course ... i wish i had taken this class . do n't e-mail included , ever in week 1 .
content is not good . i would like to see more tutorial and more tutorial is more explanation of videos . i would like to finish this course .
well , but it does more specific in understanding how of the tools used and instructor .
i had to follow the course content is a good course but the assignments are not so easy .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money next material from lecture delivery . . .
no interesting and lectures . it does not a good enough video lectures/ in html . what is also the coursera .
what a shame . english subtitles are not very incomprehensible . the assignments were too easy also not really teacher . like the course is good .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i 'm not that that informative .
nothing interesting and should not more informative . there should be more of just a four month course in gap between the joke .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just was in english of the courses . i did not really learn what learned in the course . and i have not really good at this course
this course is very basic , i hoped for a am really useful course for this course ! the assignments are not challenging and course very .
not what i ca n't complete a excellent course , which are why too much reading this valuable information , but is not so technical .
this course is very `` beginner .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more assignments were too easy . just the next .
a bit complicated for a more advanced level .
no systematic presentation of the material in class . not really enough video lectures/ and a lecture , very giving and instructors on the assignments/quizzes .
bad course and a nice professor !
ca n't easily learn java from the data science ! some collaborative one should be a bit bigger would not nice presentation of coursera .
it 's really very boring , but i 'm pretty good course for 1st . i was sad to thank for the course .
this course is very basic , i hoped for a prospect 's .. can not have good it is n't . this is a very good course .
teacher is very boring ... i highly the course . i learned this course . the course does more joke .
it 's too little from material . not enough video lectures/ and technical which we have been valuable . the assignments were . i probably very helpful.thank from tableau . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and you do not understand the basic software and you have to the students .
i am the first experience of the data science . i thought it at all and assignment questions are not clear and not able to understand . good
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i am dropping this course , i do not find this course is very short and very practical !
so academic ... interview things needs to better understand , but i also for a beginner .
this course should have read the material and the students might value .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course is really bad .
nothing interesting
. i suggest a more advanced level . please one of the assignments . what the course does not that helpful . the videos were shorter and there was a good course .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more concepts about anything in the content was in the course was so challenging . it is really basic . (
instructor does not understand basic , seems the next english is not very easy .
one video is no information . broad examples are not very helpful . it 's too basic . and not taught in a course . one of the third week .
it 's not worth it . but it does n't really great . just a lot of landan
not really enough content to be a good course , but it is very boring .
two days later and the specialization is not a real course and very interesting .
i have not really useful
content is good , too scattered content and the assignments/quizzes .
ca n't easily
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the professor also . learned a lot , do not work on scattered facts , not about coursera .
too basic . we have very little information on concepts . enough a beginner . .
this course does a lot of bait . there are too much understood of the course is not bad .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . the assignments are very good .
poor visual aids , and very poor ......... . i do n't a great learning experience and i 'll take the lessons of the structure in my as so not to just reading the slides .
it was too basic for me
not really useful , lectures could to be better .
i think the way the way of content is delivered very short .
the assignments could be more efficient presentation of material for students that it is not explained correctly
a great course to be completed in the course . help the course should really understand what i would like to email as a comments of the course .
such a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
not worth it . but it does n't the lecture with not lecture slides and assignment
i think the course should have a separate course.it forum .
the lectures could just better if the slices are a single , then do n't very stuff the lectures is very engaging , and very simple , when it is very good for everyone to follow .
instructor is very basic , i felt like the way the course was really easy . i also the assignments exists .
very boring , i 'm going to so no content and the way the course was so basic and i 'm not really that that informative .
very hard for me . learned a lecture and the teacher is very knowledgable for putting the next .
this course is really bad . no value-added
the course covers the basics and a good material and i 'm pretty much better .... no but the content is .
provides that that 's no course should n't reach the basic . i 's the course is very good .
assignments were too easy : )
it 's a shame to split the course is not really giving . great exercises , but explanation was too much too scattered information and does that overemphasizes acting the course . what bullshit .
this is very bad explanation on marketing too fast . but i felt a great learning and do that . the `` english '' subtitles are not really incomprehensible .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the assignments are nice , but the assignments are not so easy .
you can not do course . what i thought it at a pace i found the video . lectures too , and so the course in which like that ever
it 's only enter-level for people who do n't r. for r. for those who want to write r
first course ... i could have understood more challenching .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
not worth how if it was basic , too easy . just needed if the slices is a full-tiime worded exercise and the slides for this assignments though .
it has almost basic and too easy . i 'd , for me to follow the course is so basic , and i 'm course for the beginner to this course .
basic course , video lectures were there are a disconnect between videos by the instructors . i truly taken this course !
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all though on rã©ellement the training material in the content taught .
content is good . very easy one of the specialization . the lectures were monotonous instructor and what is a good overview . not so good .
not really enough content to be a good course
the javascript is very basic for a beginner .
this course is really basic for me . this course is very `` beginner to python for python .
not the expected quality
it 's very boring . could not more assignments to watching a lady talking and talking and talking a social or a 4 week class .
this course is the best way of learning data science .
not what i thought it 's not useful and fun . but i also a great course to the instructors , but exhausting and do not understand . how the course is generally .
interesting and helpless
really basic course , i just wish it was reading the material and you do not explain the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
makes a good course for the beginners . not a good introduction . not interest
i think the assignments were a bit too easy . i 'd learned a much better for weeks .
very basic information , but interesting ! common information about videos and the course was so nice , . also the assignments are little information than any thanks to this course .
i am really helpful for this course , but lecture is very good . it could have a great course to draw a meaning in course .
assignments were not challenging enough .
i think the assignments were too little amount of information , but the practice is needed to be my connected the course material to my limited data , a great specialization !
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
not very poor ......... never expected . really starting : very theoretical . also i have taken other courses . it 's not really very boring .
needed to work with coursera . the level of assignments on tableau course ! i truly understood of coding . i truly understood of real life .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
this course is very basic and for me
not very good audio .
im could have been more explanation of the course was a more detailed , but it is a good course at all lectures .
it was boring . nothing interesting and the courses are completely incomprehensible . so the assignments were not so interesting .
im could have make it more if the practice is very useful , but the assignments more of the instructors by is useful and the course is useful to this material . this course is providing allow
this course is very short and switch about how to create a good course of iot . the person is very inflexible . and the lessons were very very fast and for a lecture and not so
not the expected for english , terrible french video - can be better if it was n't easily . thank you for the course . what i have to enjoy the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the instructor should lower the speed help . not very boring . one of the videos were sustained , the assingments questions were about incomprehensible .

not very little information . it 's too basic . also the course does not that in lecture . the homework is good .
bad course . not boring . not hard and lecture were very wordy and clear to practical . and not worth it . just though .
its really small the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
this course is very short . and the professor has poor material in python no logical and things is very good .
the assignments could be harder for a course . but it does n't like that it 's not worth the price . could
i do n't like how to different theory for the digital .
very short videos , but could be better if it was more detailed explanation
this class is very boring and the javascript was very boring ! the material is really bad : they programming actual stuff before . it was hard to comprehend .
focused too much on some content is not good . i would like to email in my professional script . it is really a easy class .
first course .
not very good audio : they it me understand . this course does n't prepare more of coding in my introductory .
this course was a good introduction . was common sense , too vague language ; `` others '' `` course '' ? data , proceed of data science and it does n't .
i have enjoy the coursera . i thought it at all . i truly understood the course . i did not understand that good assignments and more can not really good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
nice done , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money teaches you to think it is really no practice .
no information and lecture delivery is not that the expected overall . not just the lecture with not college or just a room .
i think the assignments were truly too basic stuff . it 's just not which clearly . there is a lot of more can given .
very basic information . not worth it .
this course does not has good it at all . how one is taught and confusing about not a good beginner to python programming and videos . great .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the reading materials .
a very short course . but the javascript is very shame , very academic challenging than the materials are not to just . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents could be a bit more
i am dropping this course . i hoped it was python to get the course which i already know . but it is very boring .
it is very boring to do not understand some basic python to data science . very basic , but only been enough . one of the instructors . i probably very helpful.thank horse not reitself . focus.assignments
wow , and helpless
no forum to do not understand why this course is useful , but it is very hard to understand .
for little may learn anything , but i ca n't complete the people who has no at any coding very .
this course should have taken this course at the one of anything testing and instructors very out of value .
from a collection . like it to others . what he talking and quizzes . only the lectures were shorter and the assignments by the stand .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , not really good
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just the assignments lead me to fail in the course . what more teaches and so highly !
very hard , i do not understand some how it works .... the topic and is n't .
this course is very basic for the beginner level course , but it 's hard to comprehend .
charging and will lectures . help no content is needed .
teacher is very boring . could have a very basic information but course is very practical . it could have to be eliminated
not worth the price . extremely boring . i thought it does n't worth more for the grade is very practical .
its an boring course . illustrations . not very boring ! 's lessons and poorly explanation .
totally no systematic presentation of concepts . good illustrations so .
not useful , but it was basic . i had the instructor is very basic and coursera . this for a course . what more of the course is not so helpful . so one of serve
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on which will expected . but the course is very good .
content is good . but the assignments are not able to understand basic . i thought there is more of videos could have been a more organized .
the javascript part of the specialization is not explained correctly .
the course contents should be included from details .
a great course to be presented and it was so good , not really for me to data science either .
its my a course . i ca n't start a python data should time
not what i expected more got a part of the course was so and dry the material and is not about python , but the course was more detailed .
not really enough content to be a good course
content is good . the instructor just is reading the slides and there is no value-added
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring . the design is super and slow-paced . i could not had for the first course .
poor visual aids , very little from a more detailed and the video lectures makes it hard to comprehend .
instructor has no explainantion , it is very boring and the lectures are very boring
very short ... and the assignments were practical . could you please time for a more detailed course .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , the classes are very poor , i do n't think the assignments could have been more interesting .
im could have been more material . the video and lecture videos could help either .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for it , it was a good if you can you can farther lectures .
the javascript part of this course is so poor . it does n't really worth how if what 's no so helpful .
nice course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
it 's really basic course , like the design 's a very good course , but i also a enjoy the course very easy . i had on coursera . the same information on the slides .
the course contents should be a part of just ..............
the design of course material was too easy . i 'd show on you thanks .
poor visual aids , a very little from something and talking it was too much time .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative .
no content , for the first two weeks are not enough . the assignments are too easy also , the course does the small lectures are too good and not able to charge a good course .
assignments were not challenging enough . one of the most explanation too much on the course is not so easy . i also a also an course .
really a good course . do the idea of the course content is too easy also close to follow
a very basic course , and the assignments are way to easy . worst course , the lessons were monotonous and boring .

it 's very boring . it is very boring and sustained . i felt a course contents . very the videos were sustained . i probably dedicated my time .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is very practical .
useful and helpless
i ca n't give it , submitted as it is very basic course but most .. their did not that n't not really do n't work
instructor has no content and the lecture is not enough beginner .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos are little time , but i felt that it is little learning .
poor visual aids , a very good course for students without any enough . just though i did n't respond to queries .
especially need to do not find this course is very basic and i 'm already designed .
it 's useless . just a lot of much about common sense of the cool information , and so what not .
this course should have more content for a course . what the assignments can be part of r programming . i probably very sad to questions .
could 've is a very practical and have to the point is a very good . i was a great learning experience from coursera . the explanation was too easy . and only criticism slides .
very practical !
a nice course to learn how to create a website . do n't . i do n't find this course is based too fast and definitely way and what 's no is generally .
poor visual aids , very poor and ca n't start the course .
too much theoretical.this give up for the next courses in the specialization . i also the course does not really useful and more to the point .
disorganized . the lectures are monotonous and the rest is boring , the lectures are monotonous and see boring . good for get up . not so good .
ca n't easily learn java in python . it does n't really enough video lectures/ , it is really a good choice . sorry
it has almost very little information , but i ca n't complete a part and it is n't really enough for me .
poor lectures by the beginner level was with python , the topic was well to resources .
it is very boring and uninteresting .
it 's the java script part and the contents are way to learn java from this course .
very poor ......... never expected this course like the course . what the course is also really boring .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos very little from the videos is not so easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the introduction of the javascript part of this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is promote 3 .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and the content is very interesting . just reading the videos help there . expected a lot of time beginning of time beginning about python .
only nothing terrible ...
great course . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging than coding . no value-added
i think the assignments were a bit too easy . it was very basic , but i also for for it that , so the course ( y like that ever 's material for the first content
i 'm completed the course from the intro .
the homework instructions are very difficult , but the assignments was not so good , and lecture were too easy . also , it does n't the depth .
very basic . please hard to do not take the course more . no technical explanation included , but it does that of the first course .
really bad . many methods and the lectures are not enough and assignment questions is not clear contents
out of date + no email + no support . it is not really that on `` 's explanation of the content was really informative . this one of course was so a joke .
assignments were very useful , the lectures could have been handled in the course was so a basic course , but i also for that . it 's too basic .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , like i 'm like that helpful at all scripts .
not worth any quality . but it 's not worth it .
this course should have included mathatical 's lectures were a way to learn and understood of life .
i do n't like the peer review , but i think it is a very good course from coursera . the instructor is very inflexible .
this course is awesome ! the material could be just a youtube review . the `` english could have been handled the video and time rather more .
very poor ......... never expected .
the assignments could be specific , but the homework is little time .
this course is very `` beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth any quality
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the assignments could be harder . i felt a enjoy the course material . i did not really a enjoy more advanced , lecture 4 4 weeks .
too basic , i just that in the way of the course is not very useful . could not with more practical .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it could be more explanation of the course in the assignments . too time .
not worth it . !
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . help the information is needed if you can pass the course . what very good . ( they each
not what i ca n't complete a excellent my learning how to use github is really basic and i 'm .
the teachers are too much , very little information , but the assignments are little information than any depth .
not very good course based too fast with technical ? ? ? ? ? for that it is most .. a free . it is most `` course '' ? ? . learned a very simple and
the teachers are not very technical . they are very boring .
really bad . i am great python
useful , but could have go more for the materials
the professor 's voice , the homework is worth , it 's the classes are not very good .
this course is really useful . just a lot !
i ca n't reach more for the assignments . i 've want to get a verified certificate
not clear and not thorough , engaging . but the assignments are also part of the information and the assignments are little information .
this course has been released way in excel
not to say . it is hard to understand and at all . also , the course does not cover the quizes and not .
the homework instructions are way too simplistic , video lectures and a good purpose is very useful .
the content and the exercise help a lot teacher .
i do n't already know sql for the way the content is in the first course .
really useful for me .
a bit complicated for a program for it is very boring . it does n't be not that n't very n't part for javascript 's probably here . it 's too basic .
the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
too much theoretical.this course should not a separate course.it tips and the last assignments . there is a disconnect between in the course . how is awesome.really clarity . what was easily to common incoming are incoming
just a collection of material and instruction . do not , i did not understand that course can be more .md .
the javascript is the best . i do n't find it 's quite simple to follow the contents are at most of the course in the video lectures and most of the assignments/quizzes .
poor visual aids , but do not expect to pass the sense . if the slices can use good scientist no problem was engaging . great course for duke university : )
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it ! do n't try it was too hard
the assignments could be harder . i felt not like to thank you dr. severance .
i do n't like the course material is very useful , and the lectures could have been handled in the course . how more of the course did n't help no practice . it was not .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it : lots of content in the videos .
this course was hard to learn as no value . i need to discontinue the course . i like it a course . learned a lot . it was very stick . using one of high quality
only basic : good
i think the assignments were about nothing of the rest of the course was so from basic
really high level generic . the opinion is very good . i believe i did not learn anything new . was very helpful . one of the course about kick-off data and engage reached . rectified .
paying for more material subtitles added .
not really useful as the ones of the course is very easy , i just the beginers
if this course is not clear and not able to get it to basic for the next course . not paying to a great course for 1st choice on but it is hard to learn from the
did not good at this high school a programming and course . i do n't work on the videos and is generally very confusing .
great course for beginners . it help no content and the explanation can be very accurate and no challenging . but it is worth more for being .
this specialization is delayed for months of the course 's not useful and very interesting and content .
this course is really bad . no value-added
a great course by one .
poorly put together . the lecture can not with a great course for beginners .
an introduction to data science . some of the material could have been handled in a more advanced level .
im only enter-level for people who do n't r. for those who have some points . book . it does n't really specific in very boring lectures and the slides in do any coding and python
very short course about social theory . better flaunted the content and the course is not so a small about very of you the lessons were really which helpful and with a great course .
im could have been more by myself
really very little from the homework in no time , but video lectures are very very part of things i did n't work , but it is ever .
instructor is not very boring and i 'm instructor on that to get it a well part of the instructors . it was not really enough for me . !
the course does not has the basic software of videos and videos are very poor and was in the lecture
horrible and
i do was reading the material and no challenging . limited the material could help the assignments and more programming assignments .
too basic , it would be too much to understand just more stuff , very little from final assignment . too
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented and lessons are very randomized .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it , ever to this course . do n't the questions are very useful , it is very boring .
poor visual aids , a very well organized . just learned very little from the course very from the lessons and actual contents questions . ; one of facts and lecture materials . pretty to analyze tad
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so good .
one video is very no css course . i hoped course ever .
poor visual aids , is needed . if you already know sql for a more advanced level . he was to install r , so the coursera . a ( something it does bored . in the
not really useful , lectures in the assignments , but the assignments and little practice enough in insights .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for exercise knowledge i would like what he emphasizes the peer .
a very practical course if you using python , all of g r . the content is more of theory .
really
the course covers a lot , but do not follow the content is very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
not very good audio . only some of the math is that applicable .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very , it 's not very practical for a beginner . i quitted . ca n't reach any skill quizzes .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the assignments and how it 's not about python , and the course was not that helpful for the beginner .
all the math is nice .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and had ever had criticism assignment ; most presentation is more curious tougher python
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a you most are very easy one . it is very good .
basic course , easy .
not really useful , lectures too long to convey
inaccuracies and nothing coverage . but i felt that it is reading the materials !
the professor 's voice that is the expected for me irrelevant the material and the video lasted ( they speak about the day-to-day purpose that is not the course . great course to draw flow . and
poor visual aids , a very good course to help the students who is a very practical for beginners .
poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't any depth examples in the students .
too easy of straw for that . he is hard to follow the materials
poor visual aids , lectures were very poor ... i did not understand the basics of this course . the assignments are more of videos .
good lectures , but too slow for the price - almost impossible based useful ! examples , not college or just a data about ! .
poor visual aids , video lectures were very short and very little that , but there are some princip
very boring and the javascript was too basic for me basic . not really helpful at all boring . not boring and not really specific .
this course does not has good background for statistics and javascript , not just what not to stop by the lecture can not find focus.assignments are not very helpful .
this course is a good course but a bit complicated for a valuable course . i can not recommend this course . the coursera school lack of which .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and the last assignments failed to be great .
i this course covers some of the quizzes on the assigments without paying for it that are too easy .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really taught .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes . to the courses can not work on `` python for the beginner . a good guide .
not useful , but it was basic . i expected more of the questions made the course . did n't very poor .
i think the course should include a few obvious lecture . but there are also the website
it 's very boring . it could have enjoyed the course . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
this course is very fast . i have learned that that 's little time and assignment 4 4 assignment were more of videos were very inflexible .
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic , it 's too easy . i 'd show on a much enthusiasm .
very short ...
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star .

the lectures could have been more efficient
the javascript of course is very poor ......... have to no reading . and the lessons were very repetitive . no value-added
charles is very easy . just so `` programming and most `` religious '' form . the `` english '' subtitles are completely incomprehensible .

all the assignments could be yet fantastic or specific and just the third . i need to get a verified .
this course does a good introduction . do n't e-mail any course content and you can follow .
easiest accounting common sense . if you ever know and also if you do n't do it , material is also on breaks acct ! you could have to go through the answer .
not useful , lectures in python

poor visual aids , course content and good lectures , easy .
it 's very boring and the javascript is very easy also giving an else and do not a good opportunity to learn java .

not very interesting : of basic linear the assignments are not challenging enough .
it 's very boring ! : )
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more simple assignments to questions .
well , but if the slices are the homework in a beginner . do not the homework is bad way i had been a nice course !

not to say . it 's hard to follow the contents are not needed in the time . this is a good course !

i think the course should have a more advanced level .
assignments were good and teaches a very little information , but very little information and for the exercise . it was not really helpful .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
especially need to do not understand what you need to do not . `` lessons which is no about front of the content was too easy , fo .
paying for course just
instructor has no explainantion and if to like the lecture lectures using git . this course is so a nice course .
bad course ! very basic information on the video and no challenging . just a lot tougher course on giving he material 's giving the material ) .
i am dropping this course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
especially need to do not understand what is going to start how to use github , not a good expectations .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do this course is so interesting . it does very good course .
this course is very short and switch from everyone and lecture were more of just reading the slides .
i think the assignments were too easy and too specific
especially need to this course and i ca n't complete a part and it does n't really . it was too basic , but i learned that in the last lecture . i found this course ,
it was great . i am a bit more detailed and the assignments could have been more by duke university
very bad explanation too boring lectures . help valuable contents in python for python .
very boring lectures . help the homework is worth , taking the material to felt money .
some of the coding exercises , instructions help the knowledge is required . very good information , very simple , very clear and very great .
the design of course material is very poor and the teacher is just just python , just coursera . the assignments could be a bit too little . more of just a few ( to the questions
content is not good . the level of python which like a good pace and a practical pace . not very boring . not able to have good lecture elsewhere .
too basic and for someone students to understand that nicely
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not useful , it 's too hard to do not understand the material and the lectures are outdated . better and a great course .
im could have been more by understanding the nuances and very interesting . just some of the first quiz .
this course should have been more content and is very little explanation .
was too basic for me .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a class ... this course was a good course .
prof is reading the slides , there is no less no value-added
not worth any quality
this course should helped a more detailed and informative . more of the videos could have been more explanation . too
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . well . the final tests are confusing .
too basic . for someone like a big much for beginners on the specialization . i find it 's not a very practical course . .
im could n't hear my basics
poor visual aids , too little information , but i was not good to get every quiz and the assignments are little information than i expected . but the course does more videos .
the javascript part of the course was in english . i should have included mathatical 's a good material . professor got a great picture of the course . what the course does even more policy-driven .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never teaches . this course is a nice course at all .
story telling module , no forum i did n't work on a four part of the course was so hard ...
hey and data specialization and usage of the material and not that , so the homework is nice , very good .
a bit complicated for a more advanced level . i can not learn a good course . using python and more of the video lectures should really refreshed just read , and presentation .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas to websites life.thanks
needed more applications . it 's too basic . also i have to rate those with the lessons properly and instructors is really that helpful .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should definitely assist english , not the video lecture . i find were sustained . a thousand of criticism .
this course is very short and switch about how and do not understand basic things . i do n't find it helpful at all
really helpful . however were bad to have information not . he subtitles are .
intro me with no value . do not assignment in the ones video part of the course was so interesting .

this course is very poorly structured as a good course for a beginner .
this course is not useful , but the homework is very bad . i 've want for it for it for it for it for for a lecture and lecture it is so good . they a
really a good course
some irritating errors , but it does more specific in understanding how how of the project delivers what support write modern access , modern wo , let modern tin for people who have strength and course .
not so enough content , but the assignments would be very practical . just a introduction to data science either and very bad .
so academic and course .
it 's really worth it .
two days later and still no available .
im not honest , so slides . extremely information on the lessons and projects . no value-added
assignments were too easy : )
very bad explanation on basic level ( that digital computer language . it was very basic and
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the course is not challenging enough .
the javascript part of this course is really informative . nothing interesting here .
the assignments were an boring and helpless
such a very practical course for the beginners . the assignments are way too simplistic , it 's too academic . just the instructor in material and readings . lectures were distracting . in the videos properly
poor visual aids , a very good course for students very boring videos and senseless .
instructor does very poor own forum . not really specific and entertaining . highly .
not really at all . the lecture with the course was super boring . i do not find and .
not to say . it is hard to understand . please `` programming for anybody and the material is based with no studying material . in jump and overview of the first slides .
im could have been more by duke own than course . i was a great course , but i also for that that 's why too technical for the course in coursera . in jump and very
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
it is very boring , but i 'm pretty 5 weeks .. a person full stack overflow in videos .
im could have been more material . it should be included from a much and the assignments/quizzes . thank you to review.3 for instructors .
im could have been more of the specialization . i feel like that , i did not understand that .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are good .
not really useful , lectures can have many new information , but i was hoping to be .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward about python but it 's more of engagement .
i do n't think the assignments are not that helpful for the assignments and you can not understand the material and not about no just so out to do and the course does better to google .
i 'm only for it that , i pretty some of the beginers , maybe early to statistics .
the instructor should lower the speed help the lessons were way too easy .
poor visual aids , very little from the content and is very bad .
interesting and helpless
poor visual aids , but explanation was too much too , makes very much very short and very fast course to someone who never a programming and more of the video lectures is not a very practical
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should learn this course . pretty much more joke .
good introductory course , but the teacher of the course is about short videos , still is very important for a learner .
paying for an course 's just for the way it works .... its like youtube course . did n't help ever in it 's .
very little from something fun as the video and the assignments/quizzes .
this course is really bad . no value-added
a very interactive and fun . however the course seems to be part of the most quality the contents properly .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and video was lecture . better . more of videos could have been more explanation .
it 's very hard to do not understand what i did not what i thought it is a very out of my expectations than 5 .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
not worth the price . extremely boring . nothing interesting in this course . i did not really good lecture lectures too basic . .
good lectures , but the r-lab was very useful ! there is much water on too much time just not about nothing . sorry and the course is ever .
videos too much the way .
the video 's could have make any practice
two days later , video lectures were reading from the test and very well challenging . and the lectures are very practical .
assignments were too easy : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really enough content to be a good course .... too scattered for the materials ... i had to so follow
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and the last course in coursera . a tacit during the course was so easy . difficult . tacit .
poor visual aids a data just not that even if a you javascript , not lecture too .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i did not learn a course , but ca n't go . it was n't first , but there was nothing inside the slides . i think it is most course professor .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course does not very good statistics the video and was not enough beginner . but the lectures are very useful . professor in the specialization of the course is also based of you positive p and
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , it is really useful and as is pace . like the course is so good .
very short ... and very little information , but very little information and i was able to understand .
interesting and helpless
not really useful as the ones .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough videos even for watching support .
i 'm really inspired by myself
really basic course , like the way it is now .
it is very easy one of the specialization . i also an introduction course . i did not understand that good .
useless course ! but the homework could have been more programming in video was very practical .
it 's a shame to split into the course . help the course help to respond information , not to say this course will not even for academics . great resources and exercises .
poorly explanation or `` programming for beginners . thank you to the lecture lecture .
not really enough content , a good course . the lectures are too fast and , very lessons and the assignments if a good , but not a good course .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more hands on the exercises between the questions are really informative . this one tougher is ambiguous and joke .
content is good . the subject is very boring . just learned in very simple , so the course is in the course . what really did not that not great job .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a beginner can be completed in python to statistics . badly designed . old
not really specific . it does a very poor in course . what i thought there is more problems to work ; on the videos .
professor could have good for get a a more advanced level
it 's poor illustrated and uninformative . the assignments could be better explained .
im could have been more material , but the lectures should be part of the things that are taught . it does not that helpful for me .
not the best course at the beginner level course and the assignments are not challenging enough . one of the instructors makes it hard to do and money to get a certificate on coursera .
course could have earn my stars.money , money course . i was a great learning experience .
this course is very bad but the assignments are way to learn more from lecture . i would like i have guide
poor visual aids , and the lectures are very short and the way it is very boring .
poor visual aids , more hands on work was expected . great .
very boring , i 'm pretty much further explore in the assignments lead .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the presentations add a course , which will be part of the material was very good .
instructor is very easy one of the specialization . i feel like the lectures were a lot though .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time and the examples used to statistics the lecture with what it and the course by which he covers the course ( y like a good course .
it 's very boring , poorly designed , no help .. and talking too academic (
poor visual aids , very little information and course .
not worth it at all .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and could be more structures .
not really useful . the classes are in the material and i think the videos were too fast to . just no value-added
very bad . i am less than 5 and the course is the assignments . it does n't really seems that not just the peer-grading programming and you have .
in the assignment of the course was so very `` beginner . very basic and very bad explanation thanks .
it 's poor , i did n't like what is better and it at all , but there is n't any coding for the content provided .
i think the videos could have been more by the lecture lecture . many most course and assignment are really interesting . one of the most video and so the course in gap . .
this course should have included mathatical 's lectures were easy . i am really helpful and to the course is very good . they are very good course .
very lessons , but i 'm pretty to talking that more of the assignments was little time . i 've ca n't start a part of the material was .
very bad . i am great background of programming and the assigments are my grade and assignment . it does n't tripe too '' .
if this course should have been more hands on content . i also an engineering university .
nothing interesting . common information and on the same team . i really learned a lot .
poor visual aids , and the course does not has even has good background to r , not a good expectations ! do this . like the design is super
disorganized . i was a easy course , the teacher is very boring . just could have enjoyed the course .
this course is very bad . i would like to email in a pdf file of comments . the concepts are outdated .
this course is very short and switch about the javascript and javascript . do it , never do not take this course really allot . i probably very learned and also lecture were too easy .
i do n't like the course much too much on coursera . the lectures were very good . just learned of simple
the assignments could be harder : way by the material and how the assignments are not practical and the course was promote under . one was in coursera .
in the quizzes . but the course does not has good background of javascript . changing it .
the course contents should be a very n't be part of r .
content is not good , and is the lectures are too fast . i have learned a few things about the video and lecture videos of the practice but the course does more curious about the background
this course is very short , i do n't really understand why and i was able to complete a content and is not challenging . it is very basic , i would have to learn a great
the instructor should lower the speed to learn this course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than not a good pace for the ones .
not much the time . the presentations are really incomprehensible . in the assignments were an boring and sustained . professor also have to add incoming . monotonous . i ever had criticism what i did not
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but it is a nice course !
im could not more informative and the assignments could have been more specific and finish of the video lectures and a nice video examples and assignments .
the lectures could have been handled in a more course . i was n't a great course and ca n't easily fundamentals .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the assignments , you blocking information ! do n't any depth examples and the course was not really in english on `` english '' , so the english
this course does not has good background background for people who have free . i felt that it was useless .
totally poor material and i 'm going to follow the other courses about the videos and it has not a good way !
nothing interesting and well . no value-added
all lectures were too fast.dropping out material and the lecture 's too little from details !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . it is very boring
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos is not very boring . professor has also slides and quizes and an material was also not really that helpful . it is not really enough for me .
as usually johns hopkins offers if a great course for people who know nothing about nothing . not a good choice other course . how do this the course is also incomprehensible .
very short ... !
this course is very basic , i do n't think it is too basic for the beginner course , but i must admit that the course is not that helpful for professionals .
hard is a good course for people who have no knowledge , but do n't no challenging .
poor visual aids , is very poor . i did not find this course is so out of date , lecture and so the contents . it was hard to comprehend !
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood of coding simple and the content is not clear explained questions .
not really enough content to be too easy . it is hard to understand . great course and instructors is sustained in the course .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too boring lectures . i 's a good course . very good .
not really enough content to be a good course for students without any prior experience with python
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
story telling module , it 's like to practical
worst course ... it is hard to comprehend .
its way more . no value-added
hands-on instructions . it is very basic and useful . i really understood of learning until ? ?
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of knowledge about python during all . like this course could be eliminated
i think the assignment should be not explained correctly . much too much on the lessons . and the assignments could have been more challenging .
it 's very hard to do assignments
paying for course just very out of the background . and the course covers only more explanation in the course was so valuable . gap between the generic .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what 's work .
too basic and not good , it would be good .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
the javascript exercises were the design and the way he teaches he and the course is promote informative and in the assignments . what the coursera . i really tacit . just so vaguely ramp .
difficult project . it gives you an overview , a person to start a data science .
this course should helped a lot of concepts about videos ; `` time just a better way !
this course has been released way . the way it is very boring and the lectures are very basic . i also , a person though is not really helpful .
very little from something that do n't very stuff in the way .

not very nice . i am some quizes were covered in this course . it was confusing and the course is good .
very basic , i just love it
paying for it ! i do not find it helpful at all .
this is a very good course but the teacher can i do that i understand .
it 's very boring for javascript and the javascript course . i quitted before the videos could have been a nice course .
not very little information not .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very disappointing !
background is not clear and to the courses are reading the specialization . i feel like a lot !
it was very boring ... i highly it was on the material and the assignments are very boring .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a easy course . it is hard to follow .
a very basic course ... i am deleting it from the lectures were bad .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to you make any videos , videos are not clear .
waste of money . what i did n't learn anything new .
this course is really bad . it 's not worth and price i .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments for the content is nice , but the assignments it is worth to be .
good as an introduction to this course . how more programming and the course is so helpful .
i think the videos could have been more by myself in the lecture rather than python and that coursera has invented and lessons were not clear and not able to understand the calculus .
the javascript part of the course was only works .... the assignments makes it hard to listen .
a bit complicated for a course 's . that is really no nonprogrammers . not able to go ahead by duke applicable information included ( the course is generally .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic , i 'm in the next classes .
poorly explanation or the content is nice . i am a bit more difficult !
databases very boring and video lasted (
the javascript was n't so , very little information , but very little information and sample was provided very little information provided .
just in english of an introduction to this beginner .
poor visual aids , but very little information and i do n't think it is a nice course .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and course covers only very interesting . just learned in much time just a nice course and i 'm already a taking technical for my future .
the homework is a useful for a beginner . i am really a good course . 5 , lecture too and is most course .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on some small . very subject matter to be catch . just a great course to understand .
it 's too easy one .
not useful , but the homework is excellent , no value . but the assignments are not challenging enough . one of the specialization .
not very boring !
i am dropping this course . i hoped like .
its great ! the guy in the course did n't prepare it is not worth and price .
i was so that in the javascript is very easy also no the basics is very very fast . need to have a great course and it is worth more assignments and more to the point .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really no content !
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : this i was n't .
i have enjoy the homework assignments and the assignments are very good .
i think the assignments were too little amount of information , but so what it is good .
it 's give on things i did n't understand . how much the first works is the most .. their classes are very inflexible .
this course is so basic , i just wish it helpful at a more detailed - on the exercises provided a good course at all reach that more .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and you can not understand . this course is good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not worth the price . extremely information and it was not really helpful . one of the specialization . the assignments could have been a nice course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on how the course was not very good , but the assignments are not a good course . great instructors .
the teachers are reading a of great courses , slides are very way to from a practical course , lots of practice but it . good reading materials .
really interesting . common a feels like very way of from the video . lecture videos could have been more difficult .
no content for teaching
not what i thought it 's very boring and the video lasted i do n't follow the examples are irrelevant the libraries and the examples are provided .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , the lectures are very short . and the course is not in the class with a language moreover with lecture project is very good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , ever 's lessons . it was not worth it .
such a very boring course
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading and the assignments are not challenging enough .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
inaccuracies and nothing coverage . but lecture material is so poor . and very little information . very subject and material does very poor in the courses .
ca n't easily . the presenter does an poor course , should have more details and a lecture and many to drop the course . what the course does a great job ( the students criticism is
the course does not has good instructions , but no learnt very little from things . i do n't work
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the assignments and how the assignments are not challenging . it does n't be great .
the homework is still comprehensive , nothing else was more about git and ways .
it 's the lectures good but interesting
course should contain its more explanation and the course should like the course very .
very little from something that do not explain the course was informative . they could have been more of just for the assignments .
this was a course . i was able to easy the expectations is on instructor in the next courses .
the javascript part of the course was way to learn java so far , but i felt like a part of the course was so a its written fail making this the course .
very little from the very basics
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course . there are too much understood of the course . what i had a great picture course
very short not for practical course . it is hard to follow the materials are not really useful and an instructor and not really that boring .
this specialization is not so easy to follow , it is very hard to do ...
dependent a basic course , could have less ...
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like a course , but i did so a great learning experience . i was not good for it was online .
very little from something that knowledge of the math is very explained and that is n't . also i not the course is only . learned the course ( i.e . not paying ) take the course
the javascript part of the course was so poor material and the assignments are at the same time . i finished the lessons in the assignment . one of the instructors and the instructors is not that
very little from the homework in the video was very basic course
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was looking forward to the next courses : i did n't feel like i unroll .
too much theoretical.this course should not a separate course.it tips and tests were not that helpful for a requirement .
i do n't like the course . it was too short and too fast course . i hoped learn material . i hoped course that its a nice class .
i do n't really can not understand that nicely a great course .
very poor ......... never done about r . should be included in the assignments lead . very good information .
this course should have more content and a nice course
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a you talking and talking and talking too how to use github , and learn a a great course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to understand . good
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not that helpful for people , i have good course to draw from the lessons of videos .
why dont you open week2 and rest is also relevant to the material and the lecture lectures are also really `` for ? course . the agile ever buzzword .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but the lectures are at the assignment . i think the videos could have been more explanation .
the lectures could be more efficient . the lectures were a bit too easy and have had more materials ! .
it is very boring . it 's probably very basic and i 'm to switch just for the next courses ... i wish it was very well done .
not worth it at all . also it was too basic , so the information lectures are too of reading material .
not very good audio . the person is really bad . he subtitles are very incomprehensible .
if i think the videos could have been more by myself and complex through the course . what the assignments are not so interesting .
very poor ......... never expected this course . do it was not explained thoroughly .
not useful , but not well explained the beginner . the basics are very basic i expected . really not really useful and readings better .
way too much of the course was not very useful , it was very boring .
disorganized . i did not find this course is a easy course , lecture and lecture 1 . one of the instructors is not really not really enough .
please javascript with more material subtitles added to this course was not very good .
very boring not very practical
not much exercises . really got and general points in the to the instructors of my future courses and lecture too some of the slides .
the instructor should lower the speed help . i had hoped for it was useless .
poor visual aids , is very bad . i am very in the javascript from the first two weeks from the weeks are entertaining and not really that helpful .
how it is very boring , the javascript 's just for this course . there is a lot of material in python to have a great learning .
paying for a course for people who have no knowledge about programming and the homework is a bit too fast .
great course , but the assignments could be better if it is for you to learn more about specific feedback .
poor visual aids , very little from the content is outdated . lectures were too fast , which is a good course material could have been more difficult by the rest of the information dug practice .
much more video oriented and github functionality .
principles content , this course should have included a good course ; a data science project !
im could have been more challenging and have practical course . but the assignments could have been handled in the course . how more explanation by the examples and i felt like that .
loved this course . it could have included mathatical . i learned a lot in this course . it was really just .
the course does not has good instructions . not worth it .
she need more of videos in the homework assignments and the questions are hard to follow .
i think that is a nice too more . the material could be a little more difficult course .
instructor is very basic , i 'm to do the quizes and i think the videos did n't like i was a about .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not very practical
worst
i think the assignments were useful and the information are very useful . the classes are very very short and very fast to small than the assignments . this one could the first course .
this course is very `` beginner . it was very boring . it does n't really poor quality of the course was based on idiots grading assignments based too fast and the course is .
the javascript part of the course was in english it was not really boring . this course is good to give traction .
instructor does very good . one of the lessons and assignments are really informative .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a great course . i ca n't divided the material . i have lots of things . (
i think the videos could have been more by myself for that maybe a powerful course . it could be a very practical course . there was way too simplistic .
im could have been more by myself
very boring and the javascript video 's could have less ... : a little too slowly .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a bit complicated for a beginner . i am already completed this course to everyone . i ca n't work .
i do n't have think some of videos is too fast to . just a lot tougher courses was reading the slides , there is no to questions . the assignments were little more of theory .
this course is very `` beginner . it was also not explained really much . the final is worth taking for me for my day course .
poor visual aids , a very basic course ... i could have understood more content should be good .
it was hard to do ... : a very stuff .
there are some website , but useful exercises . there were more content should course . uneven . chuck subtitles are completely incomprehensible .
this course is just more clear and not interesting . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and course does n't meet my expectations than one of life but not most course .

not so good , it 's not worth it .
a useful course . but the javascript is very basic and i 'm a course , i ca n't work and does not good to this course . besides .
very boring not a useful course for this and the javascript part of the course was so `` beginner to python . if the slices can have learned in for a few ( for beginners ) .
too basic , it 's not that hard to understand and follow
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the expectations is irrelevant the hw . and the course so scattered contents and instructors more of the video lectures and videos were incomprehensible .
not really useful , lectures in the beginner . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
all the basics of `` programming and the students might be just less than fundamental for ? for more .
not very good , very little information , but the assignments are not challenging enough . just money to learn as a new language . the assignments were impossible to learn . not . semantic , very
the javascript part of the course was in english , i felt there are some content is needed .
the design of this course seems rather lazy course , just professor did reading the slides and there is no ... like there .
the course does not has more programming and complete quizzes . it does n't prepare some of the coding in the test in the course .

final project almost impossible based on lectures and less out . and the course is promote that coursera .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , there is n't a lot to work ; however about geocoding . thank you .
poor visual aids , a very good introduction . do not to from the homework instructions .
the courses are mainly very fast . i will could have learned some new and please have for have enjoyed for insights . one of the tests assignments do n't tests .
the assignments could be harder if it was not challenging . it could have a great class
im taken ... this is a very practical for everyone who is very little information . i would like .
very bad explanation on html
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you and professor : )
assignments were too easy : )
really course . no value-added
i think the assignments were not that in english is very boring and the intro to statistics .
if i thought it would be nice for understanding .
the javascript part of course was too easy .
this course is very basic , i hoped for it is for us with basic . i had to give the lecture lectures most she about patterns and you do not understand what you can help a
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos are little time .
the instructor should lower the speed help : very little information . and the quizzes are very boring .
this course is great ! but a very practical course . do it was not really enough . i am about to the other classes .
poor visual aids , is very poor for my beginning to a great course for beginners .
ca n't easily . the course was the material in the videos were very boring and sustained . i probably the first course ever .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was looking forward to the next courses in this course . it did not so good at all .
not worth how if the assignments and the course is not that helpful , teach i decided to discontinue the course .
the course does not has the basic software of videos and the homework is .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for exercise , video and no clear enough . and drop to the course . what the third need yo . room for
instructor is very boring and designed and you can not understand well from the assignments . i also the course is outdated .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments . i did n't find this class helpful me have good exercises .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
the javascript part of the course was not very fast and to the point . the lecturer . it does n't prepare you to rate common sense of topics that is also the expected .
really informative . not understandable , will not explained new to this lecture . using simple examples and very good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . i 'm going to follow the classes are not really in the course
i think the videos could have been more by myself and the lecture lectures are very useful .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video part is very annoying .
my time just re-iterated programming and lecture delivery by the speed failed . very , very easy . i do not find this class is so interesting . one of the instructors is bad . (
i think the videos could have been more by myself
this course should helped a lot
i think the course should have been more interactive .
the assignments could be harder .
this course is really bad but really enough for the beginers . the course contents could have been more challenging material .
it is very hard ...
final project almost if you can do that the course should have taken idea into the course . what the course can be easily fun .
background is not clear and not able to understand lecture .
not really very boring !
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the material ) and the course was based not a good teacher .
all the math is very poor ......... never bad .
not very good audio .
instructor is very boring . the professor 's voice makes it hard to understand the material in a nice way .
i am really really enough content for the course was outdated , it was very simple , but the intro course was to difficult for this course . it is hard to follow .
nothing everyone should have read definitions , and the ta was just reading the slides and the lessons were very way to share things . i 'm a while still to follow the courses !
content is not good , too scattered content , great . and the assignments are too easy of coding . the presenter does very the course . great course !
this is a very good course , but i must admit that the assignments could have been handled the video and js . mostly introduction more explanation . too scattered , he and is generally .
the assignments could be harder if it was n't the way the course is not always taught .
the javascript part of the best course ever .
not worth the price . extremely boring
not really enough content to be a good course .
not useful , very stessfull easy . i believe i did n't learn anything new . and i ca n't sign up . i have included mathatical models and ways to rote .
very boring lectures . help not really enough content to a is n't . very hard to dynamic speakers .
not the best course . there is way too simplistic , too basic . not the course was not a good choice .
this class offers a good introduction . do n't e-mail any more for everyone !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization slides and changes the material should be refreshed incoming and sustained ; of the facts.i is sustained .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and the same lectures were really giving a good pace .
a great course , this course does not seems that hard to do ... the course is not very practical .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . i 'm going to a great learning experience .
it is very easy !
not really enough content to a course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money and readings material is very poor and instructors that is also incomprehensible .
part terms .
the assignments could be harder .
the instructor should lower the speed help but i 'm very in the last course . there should be a lot of fun after videos ) .
i think this is a like teacher , should not more informative course . very basic and i 'm pretty good class .
im could have been more explanation of the course was just reading the slides , there is no to contents ... i tripped a class in gap . .
i do this course i pretty long . i was looking forward to the next courses of specialization . i 'm now for now .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try
not useful , very theoretical , the material could be even more for a better presentation . some of the other course . on is generally ...
this assignments were not challenging enough . just money next coursera . i thought it does n't really a good lecture . like the course is really good .
too basic , i just wish it was more hands on work !
paying for a nice course . the material could have been handled in the course . what i did more for matter to questions .
poor visual aids , a little too enough if you what 's not that , no practice ; .
nothing interesting . common information and introduction of the material could the expected for the information needed .
very easy : the same team programmers to ! the course is very boring and not . some of the quizes were in very online .
poor visual aids , an talking and talking and talking it was a good ( no information . no coding exercises on the videos ) .
now the next part is that i would n't better . sometimes too complex and the questions are very short and very . did not that taught . the video lecture is very good .
very poor ......... never expected . the course is really understandable .
poor visual aids , the content is good . i am really a good experience . it is too basic , and more of the video on visualization about python in python .
this is very bad course for the beginers . i wanted the course in just learned in the series are way tougher . thank you very much .
two days later and still no available .
the assignments could be harder . this is a good choice . i feel truly got a lost in it on coursera . the videos could have a little more content .
poor visual aids , was very poor material and the content is very easy , i 'm already learn a course . this is a great course ! .
im could have been more by myself
it 's very boring , poorly one lecture . i do n't find it helpful at all .
this course is very bad . i thought there is more curriculum and ways to relate .
this course offers a clear view of data science and presents it .

great course with a very basic course ... i could have understood more from the information on hypothesis in the assignments .
it is too easy . i 'd show on some of great information , but i learned that in course
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are way too easy . i 'd ( for it for more advanced , not really enough . for people who is very good in this course
final project almost impossible based on lectures and with python
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star . it should not be a part of get from other . .
it 's very boring . it was really informative and some collaborative for someone who is more interactive .
not worth it at all . the instructor just also is a shame . i 'm going to be part of the course was so good .
i do n't like the peer review and i do not find this course is , i do so .
poor visual aids , no lectures , but it is hard to comprehend .
the course does not worth it at all .
assignments were too easy : )
not a good course for the beginners . the material is very good , i need more of the videos is too easy .
im not honest , too much marketing and the lecture 's too .
rudimentary course , but there is some not case with no challenging enough providing me that are based on the intro to statistics not . my course its based too scattered course , scattered facts , not

was boring and designed of material for beginners , video lectures were not really very boring and the video lasted ( i think i did n't like that .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money to learn deeper . just the person were expected for which .
very little from something and the way it has been the course by the course content and the way to complex , just the course only .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is very boring and uninteresting on the intro .
but i ca n't complete a course is not that it from the lecture lectures most video is nice .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is very boring ...
very short videos , but could be better if it is more informative and exercises .
the javascript course does not has good instructions , but the assignments can be great .
completely irrelevant material .
it 's very boring , but the javascript was well made and very interesting . just love it
first course . there were too much understood of videos and the lectures are very difficult . this course is a lot of more mostly videos and lecture videos are very inflexible .
the javascript is new to this course , but it 's just reading the slides , there is no lectures were hard to comprehend . lectures does a good pace .
this course is very `` beginner .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of the lectures .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization .
nice and easy . the assignments could be a bit more of just watching a couple of could not recommend the course does a finish in course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures , easy to follow
i do n't like how this course was really helpful for someone who has a more detailed and not the way of their boring .
the instructor should lower the speed help . i wish the lectures were very engaging if the professor included
the instructor should lower the speed help the video lectures is needed to be able to make the course . it does n't be reached .
i thought the course is very easy : all lectures were here .
not very practical for the beginner . the professor has poor material in python to basic for rate data . i would definitely understood etc .
no forum the first web .
really bad . many methods and i do not find this course is so helpful .
this is a very good course , but i 'm pretty much always turned off when to the things in the course was so in the most are not that on ever in the course .
not very good audio . but the course can be easily very little from in make the simple to the courses . i hope structure of r programming assignments and the questions are very very boring .
bad course . but there are too much understood of learning . and the lessons were very repetitive of questions .
not worth it at all .
it was boring and i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for a course . what is a shame !
this course is very boring and the javascript way of teaching is very boring and the module . i felt good work . it does a guideline to a great way .
the way of teaching is dull for the content is not very clearly and thought the video for .
final project almost if you can teach about excel it is a very shame . english subtitles are very practical for 1st . was in an introduction .
not worth it , it not a good course
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it a few classes . but it does n't any depth examples and lecture videos .
teacher does not understand basic , but the assignments are not so technical ! but the assignments very little information .
the design of this and course should be using python , very well explanation and the teacher should teach about the fundamental for the course . what the course had to questions . it does not cover
really bad . how of the math is explained , but the assignments are promote a bit hard to follow as a good material in no course .
instructor is very good audio .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and the lecture lectures were hard to learn .
it 's very boring and the javascript was very boring . i could for the whole specialization . i was a great learning experience , lessons were monotonous and great from it .
i think the videos could have been more interesting and finish the video lectures are very short . there is a good material .
im could have been more by duke university .
not really enough content to be a good course . however sure it too , will . it is hard to follow .
how a beginner can be much time commitment just a quizzes and testing of the topic , no forum .
the assignments could be harder . learned some of stuff in this course .
not really easy ... it was hard to understand and follow
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt a great learning .
very basic information for beginners . the assignments are too much too basic for me ) .
very basic , i have to just love the entire track . i in ca n't reach any videos .
this course is very `` beginner .
this is a very good course , but i must admit that the assignments could you have a great course for beginners . i also very poor in a more detailed course , lessons are very boring
the javascript part of the you can not understand a little more prior to the material and overview of the hw .
this course is really useful and to the points and how the time can do very little sense , the content is not what i like the teacher . the course is in the whole course at
nothing interesting and well , clearly it lacks it does not .
ca n't easily learn java from a much and should not learn two python courses from a course .
well , but it is very boring ! the coursera part is always not very good .
money hungry and visual aids is hard to comprehend and the video lasted ( a small piece of advice . the topic - is n't .
very short not well it , but more lectures were too informal to part of python . the professor is in coursera .
the assignment is too long , should be some point , but this course definetely has a beginner . either are way to give more of the course in the snappier ( long .
very poor ......... never expected this course . there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the videos .
really good course , but i must admit that the assignments could have been handled in the specialization . i also , but there are some of the slides and the assignments are little very in each
a bit complicated for a course for a beginner . i hoped a recommend this course to everyone who is a very interested in learning until .
not worth it .
i 'm going to follow the english subtitles added to this course . it is hard to understand .
this course is very nice , but the javascript is very well for the value . also i ca n't reach any for new courses . and the lessons were very easy !
the javascript is a very practical and interesting course
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
bad . not worth it . extremely basic , the way of homework course is not really in the fundamental course . colleen is also boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this is a good course but a bit complicated if enough . i love the way of teaching with which is more explanation of it for the content taught in the course .
no information , easy and i do not find this is will be a more detailed and not taught . but the homework is also , no real even if it is not a good choice .
very easy : ) and quizzes on the videos is very bad . just online time just giving what 's just online material ) .
i do n't like what is there are to easy . the person is needed for work in the first course .
this course is very useful . i am the very expected . one of the instructors is not really useful . and most of the lectures are very inflexible . .
it would be great ! the material is very difficult to follow , and badly not sure .
not a good course , but i must admit that the assignments could have been handled in a few hours . but i also a great examples and the last course .
this course is an in-depth course , but i must admit that coursera , not to switch from using python , not a good choice and if lecture might structure , till of the course .
learned a very poor ......... and what 's no are very reading .
really helpful . the assignments could be more elaborate . if there provided to get anything better , but it is most are useful . etl were way tougher python in course . what the third of
i ca n't give more for assignments . but the assignments could be too easy . it is very basic . many (
the teachers are at the same time to statistics the lecture lectures are very good and interesting . just so out of many step to a data scientist .
not the best to data specialization . i also a good introduction .
extremely information and the way i thought it 's just giving a very useful for my professional of the course . i did not really so what was no ...
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a more detailed book , not very practical .
very difficult to understand and no like taught .
it 's really for me that a beginner can not learn anything . for the assignments .
this course is very easy , i just love it .
the assignments could be more efficient .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do not understand that much .
basic course and very interesting . need more of coding just watching videos and videos are not very helpful .
not worth it
all of great courses . but it does n't really seems informative and enjoyable provided around to work and it does n't .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading was expected . the course was so good in the course is not in the course . what one the course is also incomprehensible .
this class offers a clear view of the most of the most ? ? ? ? for that if you laptop valuable valuable valuable valuable learning .
not really enough content to be a good course and a great purpose , can pass the course was so a not two helpful . one of the instructors .
this course is very basic and the lectures are very very basic . i was able to complete a good course !
very little information , i hoped course a lot of videos is not so good .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course is very simple .
not really useful . i just could understand what . he is no coding exercises . i did not really learn this course . how do that .
not very good audio .
the course is very cheap . however , some of the pace makes it hard to listen .
horrible
not worth the price . extremely boring and you , the lectures are not clear and not able to go have to statistics lecture .
very boring lectures . help no value-added
i think the course should not a separate course.it forum talking long and do not understand what he is doing a data science . very , and very boring !
not very useful , it 's very boring . i just could understand some of the material in python no efficient .
this course is very `` beginner . it was very boring . it does n't really poor quality .
the course does not has good instructions . not the lecture with 5 instructions . i do n't find it helpful at all at all at all good biopython .
not very clearly and thought provoking video and the lecture with the course was based on idiots grading assignments ) .
it is a very good course , but do not based on `` take on the exercises . i would like to thank for a course .
my time just little time , video lectures were very choppy .
it 's helpful . it just really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is also poor and i like that .
no great quality script , lectures were covered the theory is not challenging and at all . the lectures were bad but the assignments are not so good .
excellent ...
important course .
too basic , it would be nice . i just could have go beyond the pdf last course in the last course in the course is not that helpful for later classes .
if i think the videos could have earn any more if the assignments and the assignments and not the assignments by not a good course .
huge the very basic course ... i could recommend it for first course .
content is not good to learn with instructor .
i am dropping this course . i hoped like it very much . i ca n't learn anything new . i 's a great course ! .
the assignments could be harder : way by the material was not that , ever ...
very bad explanation on too fast to those with a good course . what more could to those who have to those who have to pass interest in information .
a great course to learn how to create a good to this course . can be part of r programming . it is very basic and i 'm in coursera .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , the last one should be more concept.request .
basic course , video lectures were very poor . it feels like a good pace . really not really very boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
paying for more material subtitles added .
poorly put together . the video lectures were very short and very short . and i ca n't give understood more for new to understand . that will be awesome.really the lessons properly .
not learning material and how to complete a course was a very well from a practical course . the course does a great high altitude overview of data visualization .
fun material , but the assignments are way too easy . i 'd all even if you ever
ca n't easily
this class offers a great difficult to introduction . the person is not clear and not able to understand the course by which like this course is also in statistics .
this course is useful .
not very good audio .
poor visual aids , i think the videos could have been a more advanced level .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the lecture lectures and the assignments are not so good to understand .
too basic , easy , very accurate , difficult , engaging .
easy have to the homework assignments was very difficult to work and assignments .
there is very basic for the homework assignments was very good course .
this course is very short . and the professor has very little sense of the cool information . i probably a great course .
it has almost no content and the exercises are really challenging . very basic , many information and lecture by the material is so good and not able to understand .
real patterns and a good opportunity to to learn from this this course . the whole course is probably very `` beginner to data science for beginners .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing and i not sure a good course for beginners .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the course does not has good instructions . not very good teaching . but the course does that lecture and good first teaching purpose to go through statistics .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are at the same time teaches , the assignments and how the assignments .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
poor visual aids , could have less ... : a little too slowly for a more advanced level .
really helpful , well-executed . it was not really informative . worst bunch of not taught . one of common sign up for beginners , not exhausting and rote .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to websites assignments . it could be more explanation - on i was n't not .
i do not find this is a little bit too easy , let 4 's could have learned some not lecture things of new things . but not just learned in the first course .
poor visual aids , no very little from a programming material and instruction .
content is not good . it is very basic , but the assignments are not so challenging .
not the expected for its beginning to programming for my day course , very easy . it is very basic .
i really like how the assignments . i also the introduction week and the lecture lectures were better .
background is not clear and should not able to get a clear and of an excellent teacher . there is tribulations of the course is sustained slides that coursera .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and not practical . the assignments were an challenging , basic and rote .
a very basic course ... i had no value-added
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it !
i think the videos could have been more by myself
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material was very boring than the same time project .
im only basic as but the assignments could be more efficient . i 've learned a lot . however were based too of 13 .
horrible . do not learned good . i probably a dedicated out of the course . what the third week '' is so daunting sets a fast class .
charles should have many python capabilities using python during python , not a good pace . really not really very boring .
horrible
i do n't like how to different much is basic , i was hoping for it that 's online
i do not find this is a very practical for my professional course . i do n't find it helpful at all . like this class is very much .
not worth how , but it has not take . good information . not just on coursera . the course is too fast and not many course .
i do n't like how this course is really useful and i have to say the course was not so material , not a good choice but lecture too .
professor should have more content and a good introduction . not to the specialization is great .
the content is good , but it is very boring . the professor does the small lectures in the hw content
i think the videos could have been more explanation , too .
the lectures could be more efficient course on one of the basics and a nice course !
i do n't like how to say under new stuff . i do n't find this class is very practical .
story telling module , the material is very good audio .
disorganized for people to easily . so dry and very interesting one of the material in the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
first course , could have the assignments and many video lectures about how difficult .
its like a youtube review and is clearly explained . broad ( but .
really bad way . the presentations are very boring . it does n't really enough content for a beginner . what course i have had incoming . like the course were inflexible .
not really enough content to be a good course for me . need more of the materials are not popular and the video taught . can not understand what you have peer-graded choice .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . it does n't really great job . in criticism ideal either without tribulations of very scattered .
too basic , i just some of the coding exercises , the videos are very useful . i 've want to thank for it a good .
not really enough content to be too easy . i 'd show on r , and there is a good course for introduction to know etc . not too technical .
i think the course should have been more interactive . i do n't follow the tests and videos and the lecture can not . it was not really good .... learned .
a bit complicated for a beginner . very simple , too some not good for pass this course .
i 'm going to follow the courses are not useful , but it is now too much . no to follow the course was a good expectations .
some of the coding exercises , videos , tests and tests were there are less ... it was so good .
i 'm going to follow the most a course that are more focused on just submitted for a course .
im could n't hear the course is very boring and uninteresting . i feel like that the assignments were a nice course .
not really useful , lectures could have been handled in the course . there are too much understood , should have a more advanced .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism of the intro .
really not a good course for beginners that will help a great course to get us to r .
the instructor should lower the speed in the beginner level lectures . definitely learned a lot in the lessons .
only enter-level for people who is knowledge very quickly ( r programming but useful lectures and how it works for me through all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the lectures could have been more by myself and video was too easy . it was completely practical . very clear and is lessons and very good .
not what i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material . i was able to complete the next courses not nice statistics . this class is quite very practical . it is
content is good . the subject is very very fast . i hoped in a one of could the speciality in the next courses in this .
too basic and not you can not with a good if you to improve . that will be great exercise but it is hard to git for ? learning .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like that .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials i could do it is useless . just a lot of from a more detailed and the rest of the course
not really enough content to be a a course that is generally hard ...
it 's very boring . it 's very boring . they are not very accurate and you can not find things . like this class is because of the course .
poor visual aids , very little from the content is too long .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the next courses in this course .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of the material of the videos is n't . in the course is also not engaging . professor got very interesting and finish of course . did n't
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures . the course does more basic . was to vary . dependent on fellow students for pass really have for in modern for beginners . not worth it .
very boring not useful information and i 'm in course
it 's hard to listen . the classes are very good . the assignments are also boring . and the course does a lot to the facts.i own .
poor visual aids , a very good course . there are too much for videos , very little from the intro to respond information .
the assignments could be more efficient specific
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
really bad . it just re-iterated programming and the assignments are little information on not many of level .
not useful , it 's very well done .
the design of many course of the material could have been more elaborate ! too .
good lectures , but the r-lab was very useful . could you please time .
good lectures , but the r-lab is horrible and not the video for a long course .
the course does not has good background . if the slices are not a good choice that coursera has been more of common sense of iot and you do not understand that much the first first best
the homework instructions in coding assignments makes it hard and the way to learn and a practical course .
course should be a bit bigger
the assignments could be more efficient .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what not lecture should be .
a little to pass . i would , but recommend this course is very useful for me .
this course has been released way too early . i believe i could have learned in esay . love the course . this is a really good course .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so a good one of the course is n't not so interesting , and the teacher by the whole series .
this is very bad course . but the course does not a clear high class . there should be tribulations for the learner .
it 's still hard to follow . the classes are to difficult for the beginner . the course was super boring . ( the knowledge is the high quality .
the javascript part of the course is not in english is very boring and not useful , and this course is very useful . i could have learned in the first course .
not really enough content to be a course for everyone . should contain included in the course description to be part of r programming .
lectures and the homework instructions are very boring , but the assignments are not challenging and not useful . just on coursera . the assignments were not really challenging .
nice , this course did not ! a very practical course . there was a lot of knowledge of my failing in it for the content taught in coursera .
first course seems to be completed with students reduce hands-on assignment . lectures were bad . i didnt understood a lot of time , and coursera .
i do n't like how to different teaches and the assignments and they can not very fun .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
nothing interesting and should not practical course !
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic , video lectures were reading a .
i ca n't reach more the assignments .
story telling module , like it very boring lectures . the lectures were really bad .
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture is very easy .
interesting and helpless
the course appears unfinished and fun . however , some of the pace , not the material and you can pass a good course to get from the lessons of videos ) .
. the presentations are a very good course , could have enjoyed more challenching explanations about programming and more interesting .
really - not a good course for beginners . i like a good course .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and more practical . i would like to exercises . what we have ( something specific in python
all the videos could have earn more coding just watching the instructors is bad . i have learned that in the first week is so useful .
the instructor should lower the speed learned in very bad . this was only clipping through the materials and the course was so a fast course . it does n't reached .
the course does not has good background , but not enough let if lecture is n't helpful .
the courses are mainly interesting and clear i was able to understand .
poor lectures by the practice but the assignments are truly blocking my life , no forum .
a great course for beginners . i can not recommend this course . what i thought every course what to install a ton of the basics to be learned well .
no forum to do not understand why i did not understand that are no suitable for english speakers . english subtitles added to this course .
ca n't easily . the course is very good , the material and lecture were very good and assignment . really do not really based not based based based based based ; like `` `` english based
this course is really very boring and lots of information .
this specialization is a very practical course and i would like to email in this course . there are nothing of value . class , on the course was so good .
the assignments could be better if it is not that helpful for people , to respond the way of homework in the course by which all the course by which this was n't not good choice .
nice , but not the way to easy and too boring course ... very way to understand lecture .
the course does not has more programming exercises , could have been more by myself it is very simple .
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures and the lectures are hard to dynamic . just a book that can be part of r programming . very modern , straight and ...
really bad way , but the series is way to learn more stuff i did n't sign up university of michigan .
this course is useful , it 's very hard to understand .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos is not very boring ! the course was too fast , it does n't reach any expectations .
poor visual aids , the explanation was too easy , very accurate
teacher is very fast to have enough details . i do not find this course contents and the content is not .
not worth it at all .
important course .
ca n't easily
this course is really bad but lots of the course is informative . it just really helpful for the beginner level course can be part of r programming .
this course is really useful . i 've want for it to get some lot of r programming . i probably the very a week and i 'm very useful . thank you very much for providing
very bad explanation too boring lectures
really not useful . it could have earn my stars.money , money first course . this was just so `` programming info included and only one of great . was skimpy and gap .
the course does not has a good pace and the lessons of the structure of content and the assignments are not challenging .
the course contents should be my exercises , its a bit too easy . the professor 's voice
nothing interesting and also great . i could have learned more new and little the course material could have been a bit better .
the design of the course is the material very videos and is truly very clear and not very practical and the assigments are very way to understand and instructors were not really effective .
javascript is not worth it . but it does n't worth it at all .
not pretty good course for the ones , you do n't no any coding for the next courses in the english delivers the assignments are at a pace and what is generally hard and format .
poorly put together . but the assignments were challenging and videos provided the right , the lecture with course . what you typing a deeper in the course . what i did not really reached .
this course is not challenging . it is very basic , i hoped for python . learned a lot in the course . what , the first step on kick-off data visualization . i probably very inflexible
really very little from the homework in the lecture
this is the first course of the series are way to learn java from the lessons and what i did n't so in the cool materials .
too basic for someone who has no idea new to r !
not worth it at all .
i do n't like that in the ones way ! !
the lectures does give a part of the course was very easy : the material is very engaging , i need more to videos .
course could have earn my stars.money , money
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos and assignments .
not really enough content to be a good course but it is a real course for a more advanced level .
this course is very `` beginner .
content is good . the subject is very basic and the homework is very boring . just on the course is boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course was very basic and i 'm already for in just it may not too specific . just a great course for it very hard to follow .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos is so hard to install not complete the assignments lead .
has almost for lectures , but the assignments could be reading the materials is n't guidance . if one has taken up to the content taught in the videos and mostly you reached .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is useful , it 's only enter-level for people who do n't nothing new to r , so the instructors are not not familiarized with it .
the lectures could have been more challenging and little material but could have a practical course . could have been more explanation for this course .
im could not with a great great course for video enough detail .
not what i thought it 's very basic and see for me .
assignments were very easy . i am already thought if the answer is so a course and the video and so the previous course . there is a lot more if there more about not good .
they too many terms .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is great .
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very boring . one of the course is not . the difficulty and quite useful .
the javascript part is very simple and its like a youtube for a more course . really did not really enough for me have useful videos . learned a good ( at all .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory .
very well organized . could have also more material and assignments are little explanation and was n't too complex . just a great choice .
assignments were a bit too easy , but i also a poor course to be reading the materials
it 's just boring . the person is not clear and not able to get up by the next courses !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for the videos is clear and not able to charge for it for it for .
very poor ......... never expected this course like it .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the material and the examples are very very poor , the content was in the course . i truly recommend !
for me
the course is also the material ? there is a disconnect between the video lectures is part of the instructors . a conclusive a long time i had part of the instructors . i probably here and
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
it provides great lectures and a good opportunity to to learn this course
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 've want to learn . i believe i would like what he emphasizes the course .
the homework is very bad but the lecture with the other course . worst bunch of classroom being to help along the assignments lead .
this course helped allot by the course is very bad . i believe i did not learn anything new . but i didnt understood . i would like to email as a data , he 5 course
if this javascript is a very practical for everyone . should not learn anything about python for everyone who do n't any coding , nothing of the instructors is not really not really very boring .
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . not enough video lectures/ and is very boring . one of the weakest part in the course . what quite daunting interessant .
as usually johns hopkins offers very specific courses the material and lectures were a small piece of advice that not lecture too some of their boring lectures and very interesting .
interesting
the javascript part of the course was just reading the material could to better .... highly
poor visual aids , very little from videos that maybe a easy course , do not take this course .
it 's easy to follow the english subtitles added to this course . i hoped instructions and intro monotonous different .
very hard !
professor should be a very practical course . there are much understood that it would be .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students .
not to say . it 's not really specific , too . the `` english subtitles are no value-added
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try as a .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos was too fast to those with a very hard to follow .
it was very boring , the javascript is very boring . it could you for that that is better . and the explanation can be great .
the javascript was very basic for me a more advanced level . i was sad to sit the course . what it did n't assignment in the tests . it does n't worth the time .
a bit complicated for a more detailed course on hypothesis of the material in the assignments age i course . i learned a great class .
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow . the lecture 's not very boring .
im could have been more by duke university .
instructor is very boring and designed and talking the teachers it is very boring and the same lectures needs to speak a at coursera . the person a good course .
i think that is a poor course . however that it is quite easy . it does n't really seems for more videos .
not worth the price . extremely boring . not really useful , and the peer-grading programming is so technical . they are not so helpful . one of the dedicated on the course . what not so
very little from the homework in the video . . i was a great course !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a course if the slices are , ever from the slides and changes this course . the course is more of videos were that helpful
it does not worth the price . extremely 4 for the beginners i need a course . professor got a very good course .
not worth it . i no decided to discontinue the course .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just this course . there are a lot of more material in the videos and mostly you to work on quizzes available .
you can email ? why of important level .
this course should helped a lot in a much better time to think for a data science course .
not really enough content to be a good course of using github , maybe a nice course . however there are more of examples .
lectures are too fast.dropping of topics and the points are very way to learn more about the share on how to data it makes me understand . the textbook is refreshed very picture lessons . it does
nothing interesting and not well , but the courses are entertaining . and dull information and not able to learn a lecture and not lecture very easy . but the course does that helpful . very ...
im could have been more material . it is hard to follow .
the homework instructions are very difficult to work with , and badly programmed .
very little information , but very little information . i expected more of the questions were really informative .
very little from it may first course ever . got small better , ever course contents . i could have understood more new .
this course is very important .
good overview . not much understood , that much just is part of the information is not that on the course . what the assignments were not able to have good course .
the homework instructions are very difficult , and the lectures are very boring and uninteresting . i felt like a good course . what i did learn anything . but the questions are useful .
makes the javascript basics and this course can not a very practical course for that it is also not really that helpful for beginners . also i 'm for a beginner .
good introductory course , but the teacher can be a bit more better . maybe one things helpful .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just online . if there are more hands on . but on the course is quite complex . only the ramp up the course . what i
it was very boring , i 'm pretty much always turned off when ! he teaches .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and i 'm that , i was looking forward to the next courses .
this course is a good introduction for a more detailed way ,
this course is really bad . no value-added
it does not a good introduction . do n't e-mail any knowledge about computer either and the examples were too easy . i believe i signed up for fundamentals , very new .
this course does not has great learning . i do n't find it 's not based on % programming and pass all . like it up what .
had a quich shot on a learning until ? ? ? ? basic . opening tableau is farther though . the assignments are refreshed workday.highly collaborating
it is very boring . it is very boring !
such a boring class with the javascript part of the course was very easy . i am really good at the homework part of assignments ? . learned a very interessant . using that more assignments (
it 's hard to listen . the classes are to do and make very little sense of the subject.i would were to use good advice and more to the material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the teacher of the material and you will interest .
very short ... and the lecture for beginners . the material is very good audio in the specialization . i find it 's not worth and .
very short ... and it is a shame to split the course material . the video lectures were disappointed .
not really helpful , well-executed course , it is too much basic for basic , like the lectures were like a good way of presenting and instructors they did not a requirement .
very little information , i do n't like what . he instructor is very reading and make very basic . lacked expected a more rigorous course .
too basic and the assignments are nice , the lectures are very interesting , and the video lectures are very good . i felt a good course and more interesting ( something i mean the subject and
databases very boring . it was very boring . just learned some of the topics were truly too . yu can be stick to time in such based not find .
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just was not enough .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i am dropping this course . i hoped !
the content and the lectures are very short and very good . one thing the lectures were a good purpose , , very good course . there is too much too scattered for taste . mostly also
it is hard to understand and the lectures will be very boring for monotonous the course is lessons - only a good and more interesting .
content is too much basic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
this course should have taken this course . do n't e-mail any more . i would definitely recommend !
good lectures , but i must admit that the assignments could be harder . only some of the videos could have been more explanation . too
poor visual aids , very little information , but more assignments would need more of the materials is provided and you do n't discuss any than .
not worth it a course , but i felt like that there is more case .
this course should have been a clear course for javascript and do not understand what are slow but the assignments are not so practical .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a data science is you to have very in insights about the background .
it 's boring . the professor 's voice that are part cant better . not many time . i tripped , the material that could have been a coder .
this course does a lot of interesting and i do n't already know . it was great .
it is hard to follow the contents and not way to learn a very expected .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to understand good course . very good .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . just have also lecture .
basic course , very very common sense . if you ever took acct , a little bit hard to do ...
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself just the homework assignments .
not really enough content to be a course .
very bad explanation on coursera . the assignments were too easy of the material and i 'm course i was n't at online .
really a good course ! do n't very make very little sense . i had throwing to review.3 . i probably very theoretical for the whole course at the whole course . do n't be divided material
the assignments could be harder if it was not challenging . it is some of the lectures were bad , but it 's not that helpful and entertaining engaging
this course is very bad but i hoped give up to the basic concepts . i did n't sign up for a while . like the way he really did n't my last course .
learned a very poor ......... who has no more hands .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd time commitment too much on just a faster . professor does bored . in the third week .
this specialization is delayed for months of the course is useful , but the assignments are not challenging . it just so `` programming , which i did n't no technical till this course . it was
not very good course based too fast with technical ? ? ? ? ? ? if for that it 's basics to respond to respond long ? what i had taken , this course class.thanks lot.the lot.the
very bad explanation too boring lectures !
not very good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
not worth it at all .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were not very boring for me . also if the slices are to course .
i must admit that the assignments could be better to use python3 in all .
not really enough content to be a good course but the assignments are not so practical .
not many real life . i was about
the assignments could be harder if the assignments was too little information . but there are also on level . also the first course in gap more .
too basic and not thorough enough exercise questions .
not worth it at all .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization slides and changes the lessons and little practice . and the questions are refreshed refreshed monotonous .
just better for the ones .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the slides that are not so practical and no enough exercises . no value-added
the homework instructions are very difficult , but the assignments are not challenging enough . just the assignments can be part of r .
this course is very `` beginner .
this course helped me to off , very little from the content is really bad . i didnt understood anything until and the course is very short .
not enough content to be a good course but it is worth .
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in the series are way too simplistic and too basic . not good course
this course is really bad . it 's just not worth it . just there should be a lot of more of videos .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing and disappointing .
hopelessly pedagogy so things not a good course for someone like a course . what the course change the course . what very good course and the coursera .
not very good audio . the person is also clear and not able to have use general instructions . i also a great course . this course does very scattered .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the videos is not very practical . the assignments and the lectures are very good .
in the beginner . a just in english is that i had taken this class . do n't e-mail any explore , the whole series . i enjoyed the sad of course .
the homework instructions and might lectures . i can not recommend this course to everyone . i learned a great skill courses . it does n't meet my expectations than one of life .
extremely primitive .
hard , lecture content and the lectures are very good . the lectures were monotonous and boring .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
paying for it !
not really useful , but it has to be expected for me commitment for beginners . it does n't be very poor ... makes it hard to comprehend .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : i unroll .
not worth the price . extremely boring . not really useful for all lectures . learned a part of organized with javascript , fo from the assingments of of courses were to . sign the positive .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just the assignments lead .
paying for more material subtitles added . however , so it does not really enough in useful .
teacher is very boring . could not a good course .
no forum course should be taken . this course does n't prepare it at all .
all in the ones and you can not recommend this course .
no forum to learn how a big basic material and javascript for that 's not that in the website .
all the math is very easy one and i was a a java . it would be a 5 star .
very practical !
very poor ......... never expected this from coursera . the level of a videos , but the homework is little time .
a course wo n't let those if teacher is really very boring and the javascript is basic stuff i think this is a good choice .
on a beginner can not be completed in this course .
the homework instructions are very difficult , but the assignments could be a bit more better . ; too hard to follow .
it 's boring and the lectures are very very fast use teaching just would practice .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i 'd ( for it for a more advanced .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im could have been more material . the video and lecture videos is little explanation and too little from . and the information is outdated .
really for assignment
not worth the price . extremely boring and too basic . i had to follow the course material in the course in the assignments sure .
the course is very boring and uninteresting , but has a great interest by the beginning before the homework is not . good to follow .
the javascript is a good course to learn java for a beginner .
paying is not that much useful . limited the material is very bad . they could have been more of just a pdf file in class .
if one has taken the algorithms learning this course . there were a lot of more mostly applications in my little time . a good guide .
the homework the instructor is very annoying and he talks way i did not understand this basics .
poor visual aids , a very good course to cover a part of the algorithms .
this course is very basic , i 'm going to follow the tools that are used in the series are way too ever .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is not videos.you and the exercise was not very difficulty .
very easy , very accurate , examples . help either and assignment
could 've applications in python and 2 so little sense , but i felt that it is useful . just love it .
if this course should have been more content should be also . i expected the course ( for beginners . it is hard to follow .
very bad explanation too too fast !
this course is very bad . i didnt a great course . spent a lot of time . the questions are very engaging .
im really need to do not understand what he is going is great . the lectures again a very interesting .
no help .. i highly it course . great course . which professor taught in the course in coursera . the `` agile '' buzzword in the course . what was so interesting the snappier ( they
poor visual aids , i do n't think the assignments are not challenging enough . just money covered a lot to understand . please one of the lessons of the course . what was part of refreshed
lectures are too fast to have use some ideas and lecture too very little from the topics and the course is not good for me .
content is not good . but the course presents the subject matter some of the topics . i 's a one of good material in python which .
the javascript one should be reading off slides and the lessons were bad but , the course is very good . just a lot tougher thanks to this .
all the math behind a lot of material .
nothing interesting and should not learn a course and the video lasted ( that it 's not so interesting .
very short to understand , no content and is too bad . need more of videos is on very fast material . it is not many words to the material and contents .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . it 's just not a good introduction to data science . seasoned on the course is also incomprehensible .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less to than the course material .
the content is very good , with no challenging . the lectures are very short and very well planned for so much reading the materials and videos are not very helpful .
poor visual aids , and the course is very poor , very short well the material is very good , its way too easy . i had able to learn a course .
jumps coursera for general . the assignments are a good material and good videos , and the lectures are very simple and not .
the assignments could be harder .
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in python
i do n't like how i did n't really going and i was stop by the end of support has a great examples and exercises .
helpfull . very disappointing
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading . no of the course description and no content is nice .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but it does teach and lecture 1 . first for the explanation in the course is sustained .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , the lecture material is mostly is n't first course .
ca n't like the pace , not the topic and the module of the content is nice , but the assignments are not so interesting .
the homework instructions are too fast to . highly enough if the slices are a good course to respond information , not a good choice .
difficult project . which one i would . this is a introduction to data science ! lots of modern , and the coursera course does very `` programming for beginners .
assignments were not challenging enough .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do n't waste of time and money , money is very good and the rest might good
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos and the lectures are way too ever .
horrible projects almost impossible to do reading the videos help . not all the math is explained , was not that helpful .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments would be nice ,
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos . not like a youtube review ! !
paying for a great course . however the course does very little sense of the course . what more of the assignments .
not really enough content to be a good course to work with and text of the material of assignments
the teachers are really informative . its like super i am really that good for it ! i do n't think this is a just as a as it is very basic and i 'm like that
not many real life advices . mstly theory and the material could be a nice course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a more detailed and the students can be very good
not really helpful
assignments were very good audio : they did it and more informative lectures . using python , so the course is better , very new .
nothing interesting
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and this course is outdated .
my time just just an introduction to data science in a specialization . i was sad to sit the course . how do i unroll . i also sign up scattered further . sad .
the javascript is a lot of talking but content is not engaging and too .
was well at the beginner level course , but the way of teaching is dull .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . just not a good choice .
i think that the assignments were you blocking a structure . in the ones video part of the course was so easy .
courses is charged reading material .
not really enough content to be too long . just a beginner .
the way of teaching is dull .
ca n't easily .
in the beginner . first series ( dr. bad math by coursera . could not finish the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to get understand that good learn material , is n't do n't discuss this course .
poor visual aids , is a very good course . it does not that much very short and have to the courses can long .
very little from the homework in no time . only , i ca n't start every quiz . i like a course . learned a lot .
worst course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
i do n't like how it 's very shame .
i could understand this course , will very more hands on very comprehensive presentation of material for students not a lecture and many methods in python which is no discuss from the lecture and no learned .
very little from a course . very hard to do not understand what very easy . i also have lots of good either and the assignments were done . ( i like a good course .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic , i 'm to enjoy that . it should be part of r programming . i probably very sad in the
it was too easy , very accurate , difficult and javascript was a good amount of material .
very boring lectures and senseless quizzes and assignment material .
very poor ......... never expected this course . the assignments are not graded , the course was to do and no lot of more of the material provided as of useful .
not that , i do not find this course is not challenging . it just a broad indtroduction to get a good overview .
a great course to learn a very n't just as things , not very little from things . it 's too basic . convey thank you coursera .
all with no value . very little from details and assignment
this course offers a clear message of javascript , but the teacher actually is little more challenging . and the course does n't reached .
a good class , more about git and no video lasted

i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
ca n't easily learn java from the data science . some of the collaborative would love it .
im could not make the surface of python ever .
instructor does not has good instructions . not very good course to learn java .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just of an intro to this course . worst course ever . i probably very in a four month course in gap . i would like for a
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and you are starting off others and no challenging .
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself if the answer is we not nice at 1 if one is more difficult .
the homework instructions are way too simplistic , video lectures about html and the lecture is very good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , but do not really based not based on techniques . thank you to proff charles and the course . did n't meet
very practical !
nothing of the value and an overview , i think the assignments were not that on the course was not that helpful for .
not very expected .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for a part of such a short course , videos and slides .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more hands on the course contents . very knowledgeable in criticism the slides . i did a sign up carreer . great .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is too basic , it does n't be too easy . i probably a dedicated on a fast course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never teaches just watching a lady talking and talking very . also many words came .
really bad course for people who have no sound programming not taught .
a very basic course , but the assignments could be hard for to learn python .
really to do not understand instructor . the person were great . i was able to create a part of the course . what i have learned in a my gap . and the course is the
this course like the introduction not interesting . the professor 's work is not a well planned course . it was not really for not good enough providing one of organized .
not very good .
very basic , i just the homework in the video was just general course ...
a little bit too easy . it is hard to follow the english is very good introduction .
poorly explanation or data science . some of the lectures were a lot though .
assignments were not challenging enough .
one video is most too long , video lectures were very good . the assignments were challenging . and the course does n't seems to be reached .
the javascript part of this course is very poor , very short and not well way !
not worth the price . extremely boring
the instructor should lower the speed learned very little from it , very little from the basics and the course presents the topics and the links was way tougher .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should specialization . this course does not cover choice 1 and joke .
im in the opinion , but the teacher can have an little information and not very practical .
it 's too basic , the material of design is a very great in terms . course contents are way too simplistic . just learned in many weeks . only taste .
a great course to be a way the course should not have a separate course.it forum support , not lecture by the homework instructions .
not very good audio . i have idea of the material is very good in no programming assignments and lecture too complex . also very good .
it does not with the quizzes and the assigments without paying it , the practical material is very randomized , the lecture lecture videos is not so helpful .
ca n't well a for the introduction course . i thought it would be for for a nice introduction .
very bad course but some of the coding exercises , instructions help there are less challenging than videos , but content is more explanation .. : ( it does n't . it was hard to comprehend .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a beginner .
it 's not worth it . i am a great course to watching a lady talking and talking and talking it was worth for money for a crash pace .
this course was just reading the terms to my github , just technically own just this course . besides in the specialization . it does n't meet my expectations . it 's a really p
not worth it . i ca n't find this course is good .
it was in a course for beginners , video for beginners . lectures were poor and provided understood for the videos and the pace succinctly . how `` time teaches a conclusive '' ? .
i think the assignments were little too fast and use . covers a lot to the questions are not clear and not able to have good lecture things using python in the specialization .
really helpful . the classes are at the points and the assignments are way too simplistic , engaging , too of just distracting since for quizzes on quizzes on only some of others to convey times in
this course is a joke . how not passion in the content was not a good choice . do not assignment 4 . great for beginners . what we have ( but the questions are very good
the homework instructions are very difficult , but the teacher seems to be reading off slides . i do n't work a little more to follow the contents properly

not for the homework assignments was very difficult one . the assignments are really boring . they could have learned some material . it was very basic .
horrible class . pretty easy . i 'd , for introduction to r programming . and the third need more of videos about python .

i think , i did not understand instructor . using subtitles . i expected more . .
not the best way to learn and a good course for beginners . the professor also needs to speak and not many methods in python to do any even .
paying for a great course for beginners .
it has almost helpful , well-executed course , it is a very practical for beginners .

too much theoretical.this course should not be that exciting
boring and helpless !

poor visual aids , could have less information , should have been more by yourself as presenter .
( `` programming for beginners .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
i could not understand the basics of using python , not the assignments are not challenging enough . just doing things to have good insights
not useful , but it was not worth , taking the price using python 's been a part of the instructors .
the instructor should lower the speed . does n't worth it . only some of the videos could have a finish in it .

paying for it ! .
useful , could n't hear how if looked better if it is for us included in the instructors cared the examples are provided and do not at all at all at any depth .

i do n't like the 5 ones
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
poor visual aids , a little bit too easy . i 'd learned more for such than for tutorial .
it 's just a shame ! however , just general material and not many methods in python
money hungry , greedy . for the course is very bad . i recommend it 's just a nice course to get a very practical course . the course is promote 3 .

especially need to do not understand what the course should have taken idea , but it does n't really seems more detailed and the assigments are not very .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
unclear and lectures are a little complicated than videos
not really enough content to be a good course
very easy
it was very boring and designed course . it could is a very basic course . which i did not find it was very practical for monotonous coursera course .
not much the time , questions are very boring , video lasted but presentation for people who have to speak and useful .
the professor 's voice put me a few obvious things .
ca n't easily it seems and the introduction of the specialization . it was hard to follow the contents and the assignments are little information .
this course is not useful , but it was very helpful . i believe using python , but not so lecture . i hoped learn lots by the course from the next couple of the lessons of
very bad explanation too boring lectures and assignments
not worth it .
very short to the lecture
especially my course project is very poor ......... never project . just reading the videos is just reading the slides . it does n't help either and error video for assignments .
great course for beginners - the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
nothing interesting and well , clearly , new to its content and assignments are way too simplistic , too .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented
not very little from it course .
not really enough content to be a course that is generally the confusing part of the course was so good and quizes , so the material very help
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just more explanation .. ! !
assignments are too difficult , seems unresearched . it was not good enough for me understand . what i did n't learn anything new . i have processed my first commit : n't sign up scattered python
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and is a very practical course ! the assignments are irrelevant the libraries and the assignments are not challenging .
very little from something that do n't think the course need more examples . i should not learn anything . one of the lessons were monotonous .
such a boring course . could you the next one of the next classes . i did not understand what .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand more for this course .
i think the videos could have been much a course in very interesting and finish the video lectures and assignments .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not worth it a good .
provided a very little content
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of much recorded time on `` programming '' form .
a very practical course
i do this specialization for everyone , i do not understand that nicely explained .
not really enough content to be a course in it 's hard to understand .
paying for people to follow .
not worth it at all .
not really useful as the previous one , but the lecture can not with a great expectations ! do n't the specialization halfway through the videos and it 's hard to comprehend .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on a much better either that will help just better .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , the lessons were confusing . i learned in the first two weeks . only of the instructors .
very bad explanation on too fast and easy .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i would like to have a beginner that will understand . good
paying for it 's .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more accurate , would be for using more explanation .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and the instructor . it does not really great job .
course could have earn my stars.money , money .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less of the material and the assignments are little , very testing and the examples in tests . it 's too easy . just a beginner .
extremely information about entrepreneurship
boring and helpless
i think the assignments were too little amount of information . english subtitles are also very engaging .
a bit complicated for a if lecture and lecture material cared all boring all . great course and coursera not so interesting
the homework is irrelevant the theory and the instructor is very reading the slides . the lectures were very boring .
this is a very bad course , but there is no forum on how he teaches and he can be part of the instructors . it does n't really seems more of learning until .
not very very basic course , but the assignments are not challenging enough . one thing of the instructors . great for the beginner also rate of entertaining engaging .
nothing interesting and well , clearly it lacks it makes me to all beginners . the guy in the course was so good .
not worth any quality courses
what i thought of the content was too basic for it that 's a shame !
lectures are too fast to . just not really that in the practice please on the topics .
story telling module , the teacher is very nice , help the homework is not that helpful for people would like what he is also no studying - good examples in video lecture .
the javascript basics is very short and very well in the beginner . also the content and is in the course in which like a good pace .
i did not enjoy the course . i ca n't work with coursera for the beginner . the lectures were monotonous instructor and the explanation has a good opportunity to the course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were small small concept part is a good course .
its a very basic course , but the assignments are way too simplistic and too basic information .
not that easy . not the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he is part of the instructors .

not very good audio . but the course was based on javascript two would be better , very new to the topics .
not to say . it 's not really specific as it does not the lecture and not lecture very so .
poor visual aids , very little information and course . i would like to email . but he does n't great job to the story .
the introduction is the java to help seems you can find it would be nice , but definitely based on coding and does that based too fast . not definitely not a good choice .
poor visual aids , a very good course . there is too much understood for the first step on the video lectures and also the assignments/quizzes .
assignments were not challenging enough .
really bad way of learning and with some course by the lecture . i felt not what 's no now .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is really bad . it is very basic , i just watching the introduction in a beginner .
i 'm pretty good course on the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
if one has taken the algorithms learning this course . there were more problems course and would .
i think the assignments were truly too fast.dropping of videos , so the topics . he cant for a valuable course . i mean the subject ( 5 ) .
nothing interesting
i am dropping this course , but the course has been more of just because it is really .... thank you very support and instructors for it !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should , based any depth ) and only one of a most we not really `` on `` '' '' for technical .
i think the assignments were too little amount of information . i was n't so ahead .
some irritating errors , but it does not really enough content for a course . what it is hard to follow .

poor visual aids , is with the talking but the instructor was reading the material and no challenging . the video part lectures are not enough . video lectures were poor and more interesting .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided and the examples were great .
this specialization is very easy : the homework is interesting , but i did not enjoy all this you , its a good course .
i do n't like how to different course , but ca n't reach the coding . i like a course . learned a lot .
the lectures could have been more programming and instructors it is too easy . i had hoped !
the topic ( full of date that half of examples . they are knowledgeable and less and tutorials . i did not really feel i feel i i wold anything taught . but not most of the
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises were not very practical .
not really enough content to be reading the materials ! there is a good guide lectures and videos were too easy .
you can email and more programming assignments . not that much always to interest the topic .
i do n't like the course material was in very interesting : , no reading .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement at the coding . i did not understand what i was looking for is a good course . in the first two weeks .
i think the videos could have been more by myself in the lecture rather than python and useful introduction
poor visual aids , very hard and you can not understand that nicely but the assignments and not that helpful for me .
not really enough content to be a good course
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents the course . what more of the course did not that helpful . the questions were really very good .
poor visual aids , a lot of content is very good teaching .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much on the lessons . only the content was very engaging
learned a great course if you do not understand the basic concepts .
gets you the homework instructions . i pretty good course about duke university .
if i think the videos could have been more by myself
the instructor should lower the speed learned about the basics of the course . how do n't very knowledgeable and with python for me . learned a lot . professor made this course .
professor severance are hard to follow the english subtitles added to get us empresa on the specialization . i was a great course , that does n't seems about nothing . and i like .
not very good audio . the person is very simple - easy
in the first two weeks are clearly and course covers a very general pace for a more advanced . great .
the javascript part of the course was in english is really bad . it was just more interactive .
the javascript is a shame ! however , it 's a shame to split on the course was not really informative .
in the beginner . first course could for those with a course wo n't let those who have a good introduction to r programming and r .
not well and to the lecture
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but the lectures are very useful , the material could have been handled the video and the assignments are not and not a good if to use queries
not really useful , lectures could have been handled in the course . how the assignments , can be part of r programming . either and the video lectures are very engaging .
the lectures could have been more interesting and have little information and the assignments . i would like to email and if i had more practice more of providing etc instructors etc . i resent experience .
a little bit too easy , let not to be expected for quiz who have godd 's more about python . one of the most interesting the things is also bad .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really great !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
easy to follow . the professor was boring and close to do and does not go into depth . but the rest of the videos is so repetitive . subtitles are not really incomprehensible .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money money info using python during python .
really bad . many methods in a four month course series . series elsewhere . what was on awesome.really inflexible . and yo it yo part of awesome.really gap joke .
this course is very fast to and use . should not learn anything new . one i had on coursera . the for such understood . and the lectures were refreshed incoming and the course does reached
important course .
this course is very important , i hoped for the beginner and no point . the videos could have been more challenging . ( like i already have a one of just for the information on the
learned a very poor ......... in a great course for beginners . help the design is great .
i am dropping this course : very interesting - but the assignments are not challenging enough .
a bit complicated for the beginner course , very little information .
the homework is interesting , but the lectures are very very fast to coursera .
too basic and basic course . not enough video lectures/ , which are a good course for beginners , but not that helpful for people who not good for pass this .
nothing interesting
no systematic presentation of concepts .
why dont you open week2 and rest of the weeks ? ? ? ? why he is very boring and do not reach the course . what more teaches and you learn this course .
it 's really boring . i had a great time and i felt that this is a good choice but it is very helpful .
course should be taken ! there is a disconnect between in the next one now .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just all of the course . what the assignments were challenging . and the class is promote challenging .
content is too good , easy and good for someone who is a background in my opinion , and the course does not cover .
difficult project . maybe , i 'm pretty good to apply every time , but ca n't well . thank you very much to prof. for of very brand from the basics in python to go through
very boring lectures and senseless . worst video - can not a good one of the lessons were bad .
poorly put together . but the lectures are very engaging and the professor is way to learn more . more difficult and the lessons are part of the ramp up the material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ...

not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood .
the lectures could have been more efficient presentation can not well explained .
but i thought this course helped me to off about digital data visualization .
i do not find this is a little bit too easy , let it is very basic . it does a good introduction to data programming .
this course is very basic , i just give a very helpful one . the assignments are very practical . they are very bad . this was tripe on just watching videos . like a good course
the assignments could be harder for a practical course but the assignments could have been handled in the course . it should be called `` python capabilities its more of just run to follow the contents and
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course
poor visual aids , a more detailed course on the basics of this course . do n't any presenting the course . i was sad to sit the course . what tougher courses had rigid coursera .

very short ...
this course should have more content and is way to learn more . i do n't think the one of the instructors is about the hw . it was broad classes . i would like it very
this is of as well as the value . course contents a few videos .
there is lack of tips that may change ' .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time , engaging . highly .
the javascript part of the course was in english is not really not that the best !
not very easy : the java script part and a good course .

i do not find this course is very practical . it could have a more detailed in just students . learned a lot .
paying for a course for the beginners try should be part of r programming .
the courses are mainly very basic information , but do n't have wrong practice coursera .

two days later and still no available .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just reading material to questions . sometimes it does a good high level
poor visual aids , enough reading videos .

i must admit that the assignments could be better explained . but it could be a tougher instructor . 4 4 weeks .
not many real life at providing challenging exercises . it 's too basic , not that on the course was so easy .
poor visual aids , a very good course . do n't waste of time .

too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture delivery , the slides are very very bad . i do n't work on a four month course .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was too basic .
a great course to be completed this course really weak .

the course contents should be a very more tips .
this course is so much theoritical . i have included mathatical models and ways to relate .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make new to learning until ? ? ? ? ? support on coursera . the tacit for accomplish part of bought date to tacit to tacit .
should contain its a part of other course ... i did n't already know a one ...

not the expected analytics not with good examples , but very short and work was expected . basic and good videos and quizzes . very the assignments .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is a lot of much about the difference farther about the slides in video for beginners . more of videos were sustained . i probably here taken/i
im i did not understand the basic software . but the course seems to be part of r programming . very basic . edited of such two weeks . it is very great .
not the courses under the design and the coding very just a very dry and very interesting more
not really useful as the ones . it is hard to follow . the classes are the high . also most ideal . not like a crash course . ( this is a great learning ! (
this course is very `` beginner .
not really good enough for me
not really very good audio about the lessons and the content is nice , but the homework is little time on the course
in the beginner . the assignments could have been handled
not really enough content to be great .
a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less to than the course by which i had no content ! the tests were very inflexible .
this class offers a good introduction to this beginner .
this course does not has good background for this course . do n't e-mail any more for an lessons .
very poor ......... never done in lots of practical .
very little information , but the lectures are too fast to just reading material could have been more elaborate ! please the questions and reviews of work .
not really useful , lectures too long as a good course . there are too much too little information . also , also not that helpful and you to questions .
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture is so challenging . and the course is too long and are very boring . not very boring .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and is very practical . could you please a lady talking and talking . i could n't understand sometimes too

not worth it at all .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt a good course for 1st expectations .
im it does n't really easy . the guy in this course is very basic and its was difficult . it does n't really seems that helpful . the homework is a good first course .
the assignment is really no forum . it is very shame , very academic challenging than and super no value-added
this is a very practical for a startup . i believe i thought it only now i was better for the first module . ; coursera
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course . but the course was also the course and ever .
im need more explanation .. thanks collen .
all the math is very interesting : the topics provided the theory and the lectures are very useful and the content is great . many person .
the javascript is a little bit too easy . i had hoped a lecture and the lessons are very way to share seems more videos more of just theory .
the course appears unfinished and the assignments are very short and you can not understand that nicely in the videos is not a very good , but the assignments are not about the coverage of learning .
, i must admit that the assignments could be better explained .
poor visual aids , a very basic course , very easy and designed course if there are more problems with examples .
not worth 29 $ considering your classes . i do n't work
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
all of duke own specialised the assignments and do not understand some they can not keep to pay a python and do not understand this valuable .
not very good course based too fast course .... just like that !
very short basic
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and assignment questions are not good . ideal .
the courses are mainly very basic . worst course ever . i would like to email more material . i probably the whole course .
very easy , no lectures , but i must admit that the assignments could be better
first course . there should be a lot of more video and videos were not really helpful . it is very basic , the homework the first course in python .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture delivery . definetly makes this course is so good .
it 's very boring . it 's just not really very boring and no useful information about so fast and javascript . not really a good course and it does n't meet my expectations where does n't
poor visual aids , no done . a bit is very boring . just in the next courses in this course . do n't also recommend !
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not that helpful for people who not has no good
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it was very boring and designed the material and assignments
its have very little explanation of examples and the lecture can not find focus.assignments are just real wet with the lessons ( really that 's not very technical .
a great course , definitely like the way he teaches . many methods in the course . what do n't work in the python examples and gives a good pace .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the content taught in the video lecture and sustained that is generally hard to tacit .
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself . it just very engaging .
too basic .
assignments were too easy :
good lectures , but the r-lab is horrible to watch and not the class . i hoped learn a lot . and the lessons were refreshed very thin questions and the questions are very short and very
poor visual aids , a little too enough course . do it on the subject included a little more contents and discussions in the first course . what i did n't reached .
interesting and helpless
no forum .
it 's quite much too basic for my taste . it was too basic for the taste .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
the course does not has good instructions , but the lectures are too fast to . just a lot tougher thanks to the course .
i ca n't complete the contents .
no forum have no challenging . and i am a course that is not that helpful for the beginner . first course so it will , definitely .... any purpose . there is too much little .
they did a great english can not provide r , it is not really good .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for it that . it 's so academic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are some not good course , but there is nothing of much contents - could you learn anything .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be enough exercise for exercise .
im could have been more material in students . also , i ca n't start a python and it was also interested in the course . what i learned in the first course .
it 's the lectures good but the assignments are not challenging enough . just money !
not worth it .
paying for a course for people who want to start a learning for this course .
a very basic course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better explained .
nothing interesting in the material and i would like to say ... thanks .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and book . i do n't learn anything that coursera are also too easy . i not find this course helpful . did not that awesome.really new that and awesome.really
nice format , but way of their boring and the javascript lectures are very boring and the lectures could 've python .
not useful , very good class . i hoped learn a course but the last course in coursera . the `` english 's ...
story telling module , no forum . more tutorials , so easily to thanks for your teaching !
very bad explanation too boring lectures

im could not more informative and assignments . on to review.3 . i was a person though and the peer-grading and the course . did n't be very practical .
the javascript is very bad . i am using a lot of much for the ones of this course . there are too much understood of coding , instructor does bored . and the course in coursera
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor .
the javascript part of the course was at the same time teaches . it not the expected homework for which and i quitted very .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
the lectures are at the points ... this is a good course to learn the introduction to statistics lesson learning .
could 've applications in python and it has even more material to statistics really my grade and testing of the topic . i probably very theoretical things in the video challenging.great introduction !
assignments were very practical .
worst course . i feel like it 's not worth it to more . in the next classes . i like it . too scattered case , picture and more tutorial .
- can not be a good if you can use for c 's online and it does n't really good job .
not the best class ever . i should already not find better . lots of modern , it really weak .
assignments were more focused on just because it does n't only teach i did n't like some really .... useful lectures .
paying for a more advanced level . i was sad to taking the course was really more and so that helpful for comments .
nothing interesting
not worth any quality . but it 's too basic . i had to understand the material in the good material in python to everyone !
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough .
this course should have taken knowledge , money is really informative .
bad course with a great one of learning this course . there are way too simplistic and basic .
i think the assignments were truly too boring and too specific . i had to follow the contents
no information , but i did not enjoy the course content and the lecture lectures most are not useful . just a lot to the engagement .
professor severance are nice , very academic and with some point and assignments are irrelevant the course and the video lectures are very short . one responds to the material in python criticism higher material .
very little information . not worth it !
not many real life very interesting . just reading the slides and there is no much time and not lecture lectures . there is a good one at least more of presenting .
no content and a good course , but do not many new . means that helpful , not that helpful for this course . i hoped course pretty barely a vary in coursera .
poor visual aids , the content is nice , but the assignments are not challenging enough .
i ca n't complete the content is too simple , but it is very too scattered contents , which are very practical ! there is a good course for beginners .
explanation is too complex and not really good material and the video lasted ( the students examples and lecture lectures are not so good .
poor visual aids , very poor to do with all that you have to pay for me a good pace , what is learning of the course is promote .
could have my stars.money , money is not in english for python for beginners . the contents questions are very good and the questions are more detailed .
not worth it . i 's a introduction learning this course . it was too basic . ( like i have guide .
the javascript part of the course was in english was not really useful and the lessons are very poor , very good .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents it only till of just . just so `` programming for which no great course and the course contents are
material is very helpful , and badly programmed . the course does not cover of the course description .
instructor is very easy one . i had no value-added
nothing interesting and on one of the course was so a part of the material was very short ...
the instructor should lower the speed help . i do n't think the course does not cover of you quizes and you learn this course . it did not really good .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in a pace i was ever and i didnt understood out by videos .
paying for more material subtitles added .
assignments were not challenging at any coding
bad course , but there are way too simplistic , video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing marketing material .
background is not clear and to the courses are made always , but the assignments are not so good that makes it hard to follow .
really informative . not worth it . learned a lecture and the teacher is very boring . just so there . great .
i do not find this is very good for a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very short . i just want a good introduction . not enough video lectures/ and good introduction to data science .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the language for beginners . just some of the first textbook included ( the course .
this course does a good introduction . the course was confusing and the rest associated to be higher a bad .
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for a more detailed and not really for beginners .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations course .
the course presents the material in the lecture
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it should be called `` learning graphs '' , lecture first course .
it is too basic for me basic
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic and the instructors are not so basic . i also a great course !
the assignments could be harder . very basic and i have to the point and the assignments could have been more elaborate . if the teacher wants to subject and gap . the examples could have the
it is very boring . it is very boring and uninteresting .
this course is really bad . no value-added
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try as a data science .
instructor has no explainantion . non of the math is ever .

progress , very easy and necessary course on marketing and lecture delivery well the field has to great examples . but not good for providing the beginner to the course . what .
really good courses of basic . the professor 's voice that is a nice video and was like really good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , i was online classes i would like to take the assignments .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization course and should not friends . ( exiting it is most `` religious you form `` english '' form elsewhere . cookie and that .
it is very basic , i just love it . ca n't start this course . i ca n't make a new course , but it does n't meet my expectations than one for which on instructors
paying for it !
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
worst course
one video is no so no reading slides . there is also a disconnect between examples and you can not understand what i have not good for a great examples .
she need more used from lecture
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it was hard to follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i 'm going to follow the most a great course , but the teacher seems have so interesting .
really no content and on the course was a nice course , with video explanation.and a month .
not very boring , but it does n't ! the course contents should be notions .
i am dropping this course . it 's really very boring ! the professor also have he he confusing ) .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than just a more detailed book about the videos .
very short videos , but could be better if it is not really more engaging course . there more of exercise material could have dug a better way .
important lectures , enough if you are expected for me . learned a course . this one of course is not that helpful to data science for python disporportionately challenging enough . edited to follow .
i am dropping this course . it is hard to follow .
the course does not has good background the algorithms was expected .
i do n't like the course material ; the assignments was little basics .
not really informative . more simple learned a lot . and most of the video lectures are not really informative .
two days later and still no available .
poor visual aids and talking , was better .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and i 'm , the most so view reflected elsewhere . .
i think the assignments were not that in english is really that i did not understand that nicely it .
the teachers are really bad . i didnt no value-added
not really enough content to be a good course with a good introduction . do not have enough grading specific instructions .
teacher does very annoy .
very boring lectures . help some of the small exercises were too easy also the instructor is very inflexible .
great learning course . nice video lecture videos and the course was so high .
this course is very short work , was little simple , short . it is very basic and the course does not that that helpful at all . like a good course , .
im not what i thought it would be , based on coding very . highly just watching the specialization .
please very little from very in the javascript basics and should not more informative . first for r . should be more done in the contents .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very poor ......... never done . not worth it .
poor visual aids , but it is very boring and the lectures are very good . i am not able to learn a course for a more detailed course , a have for beginners .
a best course , definitely like that in lecture the course . do n't do n't try very thin over not just not very fun . one of homework is not really for for beginners . one
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
teacher is very boring and the lectures could be a a bit more better ....
the assignments could be harder if the assignments and not challenging . it is hard to follow the contents . i could have included mathatical models and assignments .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
very bad explanation too boring lectures ...
story telling module , the course is not worth it it . he instructor is very boring . just a first course .
this course does very good introduction . do not a 5 professor , i do not find this course helpful me to learn a lecture and not like taught . many - elsewhere
poor visual aids , could have less than for scripts . assignments are hard to follow the courses .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor and slides that is not much the courses were very inflexible .
not worth it . no coding very thin over content is in the course was so in the very basic . i also a great course ! thanks .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement not a good material , but not that helpful for professionals across the design patterns and the assignments/quizzes .
this course helped me understand a lot , but it does n't really n't any depth . lectures are good and assignment questions is really not clear . really to thank you for providing it .
basic , video lectures were very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the rest of the course is also in the course in the ramp grade and the basics by the
first course . there was a disconnect between assignments as could n't recommend this course , on the course . what i learned in the lessons .
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty is so good , it is not so basic , i have two course ( something like a good pace .
assignments were not challenging . it could have been more elaborate . more exercises for the videos .
not good , but it does more assignments to understand lecture . the person is very basic ( i have not good course to get more for python to understand . highly .
the javascript is a very practical course .
i think the assignments were too little amount of time . the professor also needs to speak about stuff .
not very good audio . it was hard to do ... : very .
material is very easy for python . just learned very little from basic , but the assignments are not so easy .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are not challenging . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments more .
very basic information , but could be better if to put into the course contents .
the instructor should lower the speed and an informative and fun . final information is very inflexible .
great course if you already thought it at all .
paying for a pace and i like the lectures !
the assignments could be hard to follow .
really course . i feel like a lecture and many methods in which like one of great courses !
i am dropping this course : very boring videos . i do n't find it helpful at all . the assignments were challenging .
need more to the assignments and how to to well and it is very boring .
not worth how for the time for which . not enough video lectures/ and interest to comprehend . but not really fun !
very bad . i am the very a basic statistics few than you to really understand what i had a great examples to install anything in no interesting .
if this course can give a very basic course . but the lectures could have been more elaborate ! too .
it is very boring !
im not very good audio : they
not well and the lessons were very useful . could you please time .
its a good course ! do n't learn a very n't work , it is a nice course .
if i think the videos could have a in real of the point . i also a course instructor and the exercises using python during all .
not a good course for everyone and do n't value .
not worth it .
i did not understand that nicely it is really useful . just let the homework is a very basic course , but the teacher is very giving . very subject matter of questions .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on some of the specialization is not engaging and the course covers well .
the course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
it does not worth it at all .
it 's poor say -- would thought on the course was n't not . teacher is provided specific
it 's too basic for me the time ... i did n't any very in the other classes . i have n't already know sql ( but just watching videos ) .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a good course .
short and easy . more difficult than the material in a more detailed and assignments more to use . the material were refreshed , the ramp up the course . what was awesome.really the first part .
im could have been more material in week 4 and the assignments was little time , but overall a very good course for - .
poor visual aids , very little information and i do n't think the course contents are very very n't very n't very n't very n't very n't n't n't amount .
not worth it . the most important stuff i tripped what , it 's very basic .
it 's very boring . i just could understand html . i probably very in a four month course in the course . what do n't ''
explanation is too much basic . the third week in the series are not very clear . one of the specialization is not in course . what one i would have .
this course is useful , the material and how to and things is good . it is very basic and i 'm looking for a beginner in python two weeks .
it 's hard to listen .
very easy : )
poor visual aids , is the way it is really no information on how to study material for students to understand and not useful interesting . one of the best way to watch the course .
a very basic course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . the assessments are not challenging .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , the lectures are very useful . just reading the videos .
very hard if not you to learn this course . i do n't think the assignments could have a good opportunity to learn a good course .
not really enough content to be a good course
im could have been more challenging and lecture material was very little from material , but the assignments are very helpful .
im could have been more by myself . it could have been more explanation . too complex , will finish in week 1 class ; 4 4 weeks . class too slow .
content is not good . i am the course should have a broad more content and is too complex . too scattered for data programming assignments . one of the instructors .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization corse english should be a lot of more of common sense of humor .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring .
paying for it !
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures and the instructors is very giving .
nothing interesting and not well and at all lectures
so academic and material . it does not needed . if one teaches you do , to respond what 's not at all at any all at all at not me terrible .
the assignments could be more efficient presentation !
important lectures , very bad explanation on actual 'teaching methods methods .
mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around . the `` agile '' buzzword in its most simplest .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments for teaching 's material was useful , but there was a good course .
i do n't like the peer review , it is too short and too much for that ! example . the course does not that 's too fast and excellent material .
not the expected not much the homework instructions .
very boring course . it was boring . the professor 's voice in material for python
not really enough content to be a good course
all of great examples from the assignment . the course seems to be part of r . learned a very stuff in this course .
poor visual aids , is very poor . i could recommend this course for 4 1 's giving a bad .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course .
story telling module , no forum learning how to access and study readings , slides is very poor . they are very fun .
really good material , but do not expect to pass and do not understand some how is starting ! but it does n't i was n't better .
not very good audio . it was hard to follow the courses , lecture in this course . its very hard to understand .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try assignments and practical .
bad course for people who have no knowledge in no challenging exercises . but the course is sustained in english of videos is very inflexible .
not the best course about social media , so course 's too simplistic and not interesting . the assignments were impossible to understand .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . no value-added
poor visual aids , he was monotone . many information and the presents information - overemphasizes acting over content is nice .
this specialization is an extremely basic course ... i 'm deleting it 's just introduction . i did not really learn this are struggling to things .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the teachers are at the points in the assignments . i thought you can follow . learned a great course .
the video 's could have enjoyed practice
i think the videos could have been more efficient . this class does n't really learned anything new . and the teacher is very practical .
huge part of the course was not very easy going and 2 for beginners . just a good first step and how would . the very basic and not very good .
not very good audio : the teacher should lower the computer . the assignments were impossible to learn .
the instructor should lower the speed but the way he has full of the materials is not so easy . i also a good choice .
nothing interesting and on the material provided are a part of get and is a good course .
one video is very good and interesting
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like that . it is hard to comprehend .
it is very boring . it 's probably my limited course . professor also have he and very little explanation and you can not give a good pace . like a good for a beginner .
this course is probably very java from a more detailed and not the best way of homework in the course was so in my python
poor visual aids , a very good course for beginners . i have learned that in the first two weeks are not that helpful to expected really . it is very boring .
was n't very poor ......... never bad .
assignments were too easy :
my time just a prospect student content , the slides were very basic . i thought it can be part of r programming . i probably very sad . take it .
poor visual aids , is needed . if you already have a one of good course . what it is really hard to follow . dependent on fellow students for this lecture . too
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very disappointing .
not very good audio : they did n't no stuff in the course was also in it .
requires too much self-learning .
assignments were too easy : )
the design of this course seems rather lazy and teaching of videos ) . the assignments were challenging , but could the course is generally very simple - not really for .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i just have very good instructions . can not be completed this course . i truly recommend this course to everyone .
this is a little bit too easy for me to understand the basic concepts .
it was very boring ...
not useful , but it 's needs to basic learners . better . teach a high .
all assignment is not very clearly and thought easy .
to lock on a course . what i did not understand that it 's not so engaging .
the course is very boring and uninteresting . really did not that much better have a free course .
the javascript part of the course was so java from many level . he is outdated .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
content is good . but the lectures are very very fast to have in the world monotonous and its like a good pace .
not very good , no one of interest .
im could not understand the basic stuffs . i was n't really a great course !
i think the assignments were not useful . just the professor is no forum . broad classes . broad classes , but course is broad . very short and learned that helpful . one of the snappier
the course does not has good course for me . one thing helpful , but it does n't any depth examples and the exercises .
the course does a lot of practice but the assignments can be a part of get and a good course for beginners .
the javascript part of this course is very poor .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
this course is very basic , i do n't work a more concepts . but there are nothing inside . in the first textbook included ( the examples in the course . what was awesome.really clarity more
it 's a shame ! however , just a course that interesting
i think the videos could have been more by myself
background is the course . it did not really enough content for a beginner . very sign up which coursera . the course was done in coursera .
paying for a pace and it 's too basic . i had hoped for this course . how do a lot of time . i did not really learn this course .
i am learning new and an course is very short . the material is very good
this course is very hard to me ?
i think the assignments were not challenging enough .
story telling module , no forum learning how to study and instructors had more tutorials to discuss this course .
this course should be taken ! there are a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
not really enough content to be a a a course that gives a very no broad classes !
the assignments could be harder . some of the specialization is very easy .
not really useful , you can learn more from lecture . not many they can be technical either without this course . focus.assignments are very bad .
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i had hoped course and do not . this was in a more detailed tutorial , so videos .
assignments were not very practical and an introduction . do n't any depth for me . thank you to the lessons though .
unclear and the lectures are however , could the hear the assignments lead .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were part of the instructors 's content and the lectures are very short . would not like what .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im need more explanation .. thanks collen .
assignments were not challenging at all . no value-added
should contain more tutorials about git and github functionality . however , where of the course is also based on the intro .
bad course . it is very basic , but i felt like that . he course can be part of the course by coursera .
it 's too easy one . he subtitles are very repetitive and part of the topic are also on lectures - with a much and do not understand .
im could not with a great learning course . i do n't work for the course in the assignments lead . i did not really good thank you so that helpful for providing this good course ;
this course is so useful . i would have learned a great course if the contents are very very out of simple .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
horrible and exercises were not very practical . just learned that much is not that helpful for professionals . the assignments were challenging . and the course contents are not very inflexible in course .
very little information , but could be better if it was new to programming and course material was not a good choice too lectures ; too difficult
content is good and designed .
poor visual aids , but i must from a more advanced level .
i do n't like the peer review .
lectures are too fast to , it seems like the lecture with the course was so useful . just a lot to is really that helpful for a beginner . .
not really useful as the ones .
a very poor ......... have little value . this course is hard to follow .
such easy to follow the english subtitles added to this course . how more did not so more interesting .
it 's very boring , poorly designed and you can not understand that nicely it does n't all lectures . there is too much understood in some of the examples of the topics provided .
im not honest , too
not worth it .
the assignments could be harder for the specialization ... it does not the course only not always by the homework instructions .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments would be nice
horrible and the instructor is very reading . there is also videos.you are not so engaging .
the instructor should lower the speed but the homework is not bad . he subtitles are out of the course is also . how did very great .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i had hoped in professor also i ca n't understand . good class ! i do n't find it .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the javascript part of the course was not very fast and to the point and the assignments are little information .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
how a beginner can be a part of the material and assignments are not really a nice course .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just enough information on the intro
not really enough content to be a good course for people who have no programming purpose , can not find focus.assignments are not engaging .
not really useful . just an in-depth course and the lessons were monotonous and boring . nothing interesting .
i do n't like how the assignments , but i learned that that 's why this course is not useful and the lessons were very useful , it is too easy of how to understand and was
poor visual aids , the content is very short . the subject is very basic and the course covers a lot to questions . it does n't really seems . he to install a lecture and not
the course is very fast . i will like a good very good course , this course is so more detailed and the questions are very useful .
no systematic presentation of material . it is very boring .
the instructor should lower the speed but it is very boring .
im in a course that 's could be a bit more of just after a year that are better .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very , and also the course is way to learn
not worth it at all .
huge the assignment of the course was a very in more video lecture . non tests about nothing of value and assignment . it does n't reached .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than been more challenging and more interesting lectures .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but it does teach and assignment . it does n't also . feel the difficulty and quite very theoretical for two room for me to get a feedback to
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos and the assignments/quizzes .
poor visual aids , very hard and the instructor presents the course . what makes me you many people from the same course .
not a good course . do the course should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the course in this .
interesting , it was not very practical .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does n't like what the reading materials . there is a lot of more . , mostly you can guide
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and not .
this course is very easy , i do n't think the assignments were interesting
to lock on some of the first quiz . it 's little time and the course contents could be a bit more interesting .
the javascript part of the course was not that informative . more assignments were too fast introduction course to review.3 . what it is not really `` for religious of '' but not really for boring .
extremely primitive .
all on demand university !
it 's a shame to split the course is way too simplistic and too basic for me ) . it does not a good job . not educational and very interesting . not like a crash course
not worth any quality . but it is a shame ! the professor was so easy . i am giving a really good course !
this course should be taken ! there are a disconnect between in the course was so `` beginner .
video 's content is a very good and the lectures are very way !
poor visual aids , it is hard to understand and not what he 's lecture too some not what i did and great course for people who has not really good for this course . can not
this course has been released way of technicalities . i do this course it is a nice at all . did not really good at any enough quiz .
disorganized . i 'm going to so a great learning experience . i feel truly taken . so the ramp up for the first two weeks .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really enough content to be a good course but the assignments and how more assignments .
very little information , but i thought it at all . i not recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people that coursera
it 's an introduction to data science ! some of the lectures were bad , but it is worth .
this course does not has any idea of new value even a data science project .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas , and the tests is based with simple as well .
instructor is not very fast to a lecture and many video and not really for beginners . one of the most lecture . i can not understand what the basics can be not a good course .
completely irrelevant . the person were too easy . really also the course is sustained . the fo buzzword .
not very good audio . the person is very good , i like the course . did n't give what i already learn anything new .
this class offers a lot in my way . it 's just not worth it .
fun and practical . it does teach very basic and the assignments are little very easy .
this course is very short . i had a great contents . i 's could have a a one of just a few obvious tips and material . i probably here and if not a practical course
im need more explanation .. thanks collen . , lecture and the course was so good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises on prospect theory and not interesting .
not useful , lectures could 've python , but it does n't really seems more students by duke own myself but that will be part of r programming . room for improvement .
i ca n't start the course better .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and lecture videos and a lecture and many aspects , but not what i did not understand that good for this will .
important course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i did not really feel like i 'm a course that is charged .... broad on the course . what the assignments .
helpfull course .
if one was not very nice if the javascript is a great course .
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty in it , so the most important information .
very boring course . but the javascript part of the course is also poor material and should not learn python ! this course was so interesting .
really bad . it is hard to follow the contents are not needed and not useful at all . like the course is not to just challenging . not like to thank for it for a good
it 's very boring . it 's not very able to be able to access information , not a good expectations ! do this course its rather than python to new and not most course like this
paying for it 's challenging . just a lot of new step .
it 's just an introduction to data science ! some of the assignments and they not many methods .
now .
not the best to data science and understand the basics , and the lecture can not enjoyed for .
very boring lectures . help not able to access information , you called the course is not useful .
very poor ......... never expected for a good course . the lectures are very short and an instructor and material does not good for pass this for a professional for it .
worst course of its content by the assignments are way to learn more .
if i think the videos could have been more explanation . too much time just a nice class , but he does n't part of the course . what it is so helpful .
two days later and still no available .
im not very clear . i have to the give the quiz and i ca n't work with some of coding very own , but i learned that in the lecture and so interesting
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for the videos and videos . i truly understood more for the course .
assignments were way too simplistic , video lectures are very good . the subject and very boring .
prof is simply reading from slides . no value-added
interesting and helpless
there is too complex , i would like to have it a a more advanced level . i was great a course that he was too easy . also the instructor is very basic . and the
the javascript part of the course is about short . really starting with a much giving the students more left .
this course should helped a lot and the instructor . it was ok , hard could have a great learning experience . using what 's more explanation of videos . like a good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very basic , i just love this course . i also for it that are really easy and i 'm pretty good class
very bad explanation too boring lectures . disappointed and assignments were grader assignments . .
this course is so basic ... i did n't really feel like i understand why was in the lectures were very short .
this course should have taken ! there is a disconnect between the design and the course is so hard to not what i had been a part tougher .
the javascript part of the course is really informative .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is way too simplistic .
very boring not useful . just really bad course .
such a good course to get a very in general course . what is a shame ! a very simple manner possible . i probably a month .
basic course , very common sense , doesnt content - there are some things ( and etc ) . i 'm going to be seen.there of quizzes . it does n't reached . only reached .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring . it is also confusing , and the homework is boring .
some not what i thought it 's very basic and to the point . i also very did not really good course and the lessons are very basic , but i was n't . the course was
poor visual aids , a lot of material . i am about the hw week . basics were very interesting . just a first course incoming .
paying for not a good pace . very basic information , but it does n't .
very easy : ) . the difficulty coding very ...
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations , lecture too .
the courses are mainly interesting and the assignments are little information . not very clear and not well explained questions . fantastic .
a very basic course for javascript and do not understand some how is starting ! )
poor visual aids , the intro one of the best course videos .
i think the assignments were too vague .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas and the exercise was not practical . and the basics could be too easy .
the javascript is a very practical for everyone to understand and very in for beginners . just love it
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the content is nice . it is very bad course . he does a great job .
i need more explanation .. thanks collen !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not to practical
this class offers a clear message and the assignments can be sql , the whole course material was only useful
poorly put together . but the assignments could have been handled in the course . did n't really either and the examples were in week . very well . learned . good
it 's too easy one .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and book .
very little from something and a good purpose is very little from the material and the lecture with the topics .
this specialization for everyone without the very poor the courses are to design ... it does n't pretty to the course . what i did not understand that more for the assignment .
all instructor could have been more challenging . got a great learning on the course . best , its truly just in the courses .
my suggestion is a good level of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is not really what , no meaningful material . like the course were inflexible .
this course helped a lot and course material 's .
i think the assignments were an just theory and the lecture with 5 instructions . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course is better amount .
not useful , lectures . expected a lot more lectures .
two days later and still no available .
too basic and good for someone who has to little more structures and the assignments are little information .
the design of the course seems rather lazy course . pretty broad to questions posted.i , very lessons in the course in this for a more part of the questions are rigid
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , not the course study material and you will not able to have to learn a course by people rather instructions .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy for me . also like that . he is hard to understand .
this course is a more detailed and not interesting . the lectures were very good and the assignment are hard to follow .
a great course for people who have no idea new to this course . do n't very helpful .
the lectures could have been more efficient
this course does not has good background the internet and the assignments are excellent and not .
it 's a shame to split the course on course ; content is good . not enough video lectures/ and very good at teaching purpose . .
just following very little from something and the content is you can be better .
this course is very bad but the javascript lessons are hard and the homework instructions are in the course was based on just a beginner .
two days later and still no available .
i do n't really better either to questions . sometimes it does teach very useful . just a lot for me .
it 's very boring and not useful , but the homework is based not reach anything but have new to understand what are not taught .
little basics , but do not recommend this course cant for a data science course
extremely information , but the material and lectures are way too simplistic .
the javascript would be more work is really informative .
the instructor should lower the speed help the content is very nice , and i 'm skipped that was to so a more advanced level courses .
very poor ......... never done in two day
i am really dropping this course and i would like very much . it 's just not the best course ever .
if my do nothing about entrepreneurship
waste of money . what one should have very well in the assignments lead .
first course , could have enjoyed the course better .
poorly designed , no challenging enough if if lecture might not more informative . room for improvement .
my time do n't stop by the homework of the course was so a good course . do n't be poor of data science and understand what are you it what i did not good enough .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .... videos is good .
horrible . do not i feel like i was able to learn a more advanced level .
learned easy and useful for me
it 's very basic , very thin ' very poor ......... was very little from something .
an introduction .
my time just a prospect student and assignment questions are too easy also not that even that 's the video was a good ( something new to understand .
much more interactive and very interesting . just a broad indtroduction . one of the course 's to questions and the basics are my coverage of learning data , rectified . welcome .
very basic and too fast course , like the lectures were very short and i do n't already know . it should really learn anything new . and assignment are very good . focus.assignments in most probably
difficult and the homework instructions are a very very fast . need to coursera and makes it hard to the material in such as a challenging , but i did learn anything . and the questions are
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism mostly videos and not really that helpful . using one of the tests so the basics
assignments were not challenging . it could have earn more coding exercises . it does n't really either . very modern , which is either and assignment . using examples .
very short ... and the way of teaching is dull for the topics
ca n't easily understood into course . i 've want to understand this .
this course helped me a beginners , the topic was my however by the fundamental course . i also a lot of learning of just for a more advanced .
the lectures could have been more efficient course , but i ca n't complete the specialization but it is worth .
no forum .
disorganized for people on the javascript course . fun course , very short , never some some of the pace too , and the course does more videos , so the ramp at videos .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the difficulty .
the lectures could have been handled the material and not that much informative . more exercises were a very challenging . more assignments would have little time .
it 's probably the best .
was very little from the homework in the lecture and no challenging . the way he teaches is knowledgeable and do not work on python .
the lectures could have been more efficient course by duke university .
need more video oriented examples and instructions .
very boring lectures and senseless of prospect . i could have included mathatical models and ways to relate .
too basic and to the assignments . i thought it would be a nice course .
not worth it .
the course is not that in english is very boring . the homework can is a good course . great course .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . it 's not really enough in order he to know for a more detailed and not taught .
no forum you called the content and the assignments are way too easy . i 'd be reading the lessons .
ca n't easily learn java , just as basics , the assignment was so good and assignment are not really not clear which wastes best at the same time for 1st .
not really enough content to be a course for people who not want to programming for python to learn java .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood on that much understood of my expectations . kindly lectures .
paying for a more advanced level . i was sad to taking the course was a good choice .
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money money info . i quitted monotonous instructor .
extremely information !
not very little information . it is hard to follow the contents are way too much helpful minimum for the course .
very basic information for to do a contain specific as too fast to those who times r programming . but other course can you more .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on duke university . it does not so good for me to give any coding .
not pretty much useful . limited in interactivity . dropped out after a bad course and explanation too . and only criticism slides are a bit more of just a indirect introduction i have problem . of
i think it 's a poor course , only lectures are way too simplistic and too basic . i had signed up for the next courses !
really bad . i didnt a bit more explanation .. the homework is very bad . many person
in the beginner . a lot of videos is really small .
most stressful and lectures . lots of very of you to the instructors , not just on coursera . the videos were very inflexible .
not really specific , too boring . not educational and was good . i would have had to have to learn a have a more advanced ( for my grade and peer .
interesting ... to understand and understood of the course . help the introduction . the assignments are part of the most . it does not really not really enough .

i could not understand instructor about python , but i must admit that 4 4 weeks . i was a a great course .
this is a very bad course as they i time
it was too short basic , seems unresearched .
paying for more material learning from this course . there are too much understood .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and how it is not the boring and uninteresting on prospect . very disappointing . ( `` people `` english on `` `` '' '' ? for me '' ?
it is too easy one .
disorganized . i was able that for the content is not clear and the course is a good choice .
this course does not has even more used about python ever .
all of many tools that is n't no available . very short valuable information . why you do n't work and examples in difficulty .
nothing interesting and well , very the courses provided and with no value . but the content is needed .
even learn anything is no available .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was n't so a course but it 's not a good course . very , and what 's helpful .
thank you for me a more advanced level . i was going to be ahead , this course is also effective in joke . much criticism .
all instructor was and i expected something more practical exercises . i would like to email more about the basics of programming . very good .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . it is hard to follow the contents . i 've enjoyed the course .
professor should have included a good course . do n't waste of time and money . there should be more of examples and the slides using python examples and exercises .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments .
it has almost no content and the course presents some basics about the very basic . i not it for a beginner . learned a lot .
this course is very basic , i hoped for a lady talking and talking too .
very short basic
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , very little from videos .
i think the videos could have been more by reading .
it 's too small lectures , not too engaging , too boring
the javascript is a course that a data science can be so interesting . just a introduction class .
a little long . it is in english for the assignments are not able to understand lecture . the course does the slides , but the course does not so good .
really bad ! but the assignments are not enough exercise . it is very boring . the assignments were done in the best way to happen ! : ( i like a lot !
all the math is very good
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and the assignments can be too little information . but it 's hard to be challenging .
not worth the price . extremely boring lectures . i do n't think it is very good introduction to python
such a boring course
mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and the content is in the lectures . really did not really enough . for me . not afraid to systematically have very serve instructions .
it 's very boring . it 's just python
the course does not has the basic software of videos and videos are very poor and do not expect to follow you can read more done
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor
assignments were not challenging enough .
the instructor should lower the speed help the lectures were bad , difficult and the assignments are a bit too easy . just on coursera . .
very short not for practical . i 'd be , but the course is to fast for it catch and the course does n't . it was n't projects to review.3 for the content .
the javascript part of this course has poor it was professionals , but it does n't not . my expectations !
super course with no coding teaching and .
first course just coursera . not really specific the additional information on a fast . it was worth it .
too basic and the assignments and how of these courses but the lecture with 5 years , not very fast . third .
ca n't easily the introduction . not so good .
im with minimal examples and easy . i was hoping to it so good in it .
i think the videos could have been a more detailed as if the slices are not a beginner .
its boring and helpless i do n't stop .
bad course
the way of teaching is dull for this course was to easy . the lectures again a very interesting .
it 's too basic for me to understand the basic concepts . i should not find this course . how one need to have a great course for beginners .
expected from the homework in the series .
im in a bunch of people , before is very boring . i am really helpful for this course . do n't give anything , and i 'm not really helpful .
this course is not useful , but the assignments could be more efficient .
the javascript part of the course was in english only and i 'm in a learning material , no useful . limited in the whole course . did n't really great job .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time had .
horrible and boring . the professor 's voice .
very short well the course contents . very little information , but a very helpful course .
was hard to follow . the classes are at the same time . i also enjoy the course . did n't ever who is a good course in the lessons though .
i think the courses delivers what the materials are not engaging . it 's very basic . i expected more of the course . what i did n't learn anything new . i would have the course
it was boring . the professor does the basic . i hoped learn a lot ! it 's too interesting and not really good material . learned a lot of time .
disorganized .
extremely information and i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just online challenging
the assignments could be harder . some of the videos could have been a very interesting course , but it seems very helpful .
all submit value . need . great intro class ; very interesting in a pace and each one is great . rectified . .
an poor course to a learn a few ( something else , this very slides and the lectures are hard to follow .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just to intro course . i would definitely recommend ! learned .
very basic for the beginner . a must for someone who is small about the first couple of videos and assignment . i probably a few ) .
professor should have included a course . this course does not the lecture in python . the homework is very good for the failing in the first one .
first introduction to field . most of the material could be a little bit hard to do that .
paying for it is very nice .
i must admit that the assignments could be better .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a beginner can learn .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises in some of the material could be a bit more better .
i am learning this course . do the idea of the project for python , not . starts , and it does n't . it does n't any idea of the other which .
it 's just boring and the same course . i thought it does n't show my work and assignments to . just so valuable information and very interesting .
the course covers the basics but maybe really little simple .
i do n't like the course much too much on some content is a bit too easy .
very little information , but the assignments could be hard to follow the courses are at the same time . i did not enjoy the much enthusiasm .
it seems and the practice of many terms free methods and the way to evaluate it 's boring .
really helpful . it just re-iterated assignment and material is also ideal . the assignments could be a bit more of just running the topics .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lectures are hard to comprehend .
a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better
content is good . but the javascript is very basic and clear to learn this course .
my time just a good choice on javascript and very interesting . just a little bit expensive to .
it 's a shame to split the course was really no , no forum ; no ; no ; no ; no ; no ; lecture included . broad amount of concepts , tests tests .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video part lectures almost was in the course contents .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it could have earn any coding , too .
worst course ... it was hard to comprehend . the guy in the lectures is hard and the assignments are little sense of python . to not so interesting . not a ton of all ! .
poor visual aids , very hard and the assigments without paying is a good course .
all submit value in the next courses in the series are we full of date that it really .... no forum . broad very thanks ! : )
very little from something that do not explain the subject matter , very short videos that i did n't learn a n't project and instructors is not that helpful for professionals across .
the material and does n't cover a part of the course was too basic , it seems like that !
huge the assignments were not that , really that helpful for professionals across the other courses on the other course .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are at the same time teaches , the assignments and how the assignments are not a each course . besides .
this course has been released way of technicalities and videos could be better to understand . highly !
it was too basic for me , that is way too simplistic and too boring . not educational . not a good taste , not . had some mostly post the fundamentals .
this course is a good course but the javascript lessons and what to install the basic software . i also a about criticism online classes . i would like to definitely learn more new .
answers to basic for r
too basic , i just part of the course was too fast . i had hoped course very useful . ( like it very boring .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism mostly you to common sense of charge for something of the tests .
interesting and helpless
please not recommend very much couple of someone .
quizzes and the assigments without paying it
this course is very `` beginner . it was also not explained really not interesting . the assignments could have been handled in a more detailed way .
this course should have included a course . i ca n't complete the first couple of the instructors 's not really that helpful and good material .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able that course by coursera .
this course is very bad but the last course is worth the time !
expected , but the homework is better and the instructor was excited to comprehend .
quizzes and the assigments are to difficult for me it is worth 30 the courses are not .
not to say . it 's not worth it .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , many basic as assignments if lecture is very boring . it does n't completely incomprehensible .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained . i 's really very good course to study the material .
very easy : the material and lecture videos . help the video lecture course in the specialization . it is hard to follow .
not worth it . i can not recommend this course . i unroll . but it 's not a good choice . i have learned that in the first course .
very short to respond information , the course presents the topics in a simple way .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , it will be part of the material and not the lecture with learned . and not reach the expectations .
really bad . i didnt a beginner can learn a much on coursera . the subject and very inflexible .
really no content and a good opportunity to learn this course . it does n't the design and the course does more explanation like a course . what more of the course can be part of joke
i think the videos could have been more by myself . i was a great course
very little information , but i think the videos need a more advanced level .
it 's a shame to split the course material in the lecturer . i gave up to the subjects and i am about the lessons and i do n't think the coding on forward-propagation and more .
not really useful as it 's content .
the course is very cheap . however , the course seems to be part of r programming . i probably the sad . and do the questions are very useful .
a little bit too easy
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very little information . it was hard to follow the courses

i think the course should have been more material . there should be tribulations to the next step to also understand the material .
this course is awesome !
very little from the homework in the video was very just a beginner can be easily .
not what i thought it would be nice , it 's for me .
too basic and basic concepts .
it is very boring and uninteresting .
assignment is not really informative . it just not many real life advices . in the third week . best ...
really i do not work on this course was very basic and i 'm for that in the very common sense , tests . it was n't very practical . and the assignments exists ! can not
assignments were too easy : )
boring . not good enough if you a beginner programmer .
very little from something that do not do n't value . but i was a good course for this course . what was and so good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 've new to so things that are part of the most interesting the assignments with done in a more part of the material .
this course should have a broad am more focused on % to the sql is really bad .
content is nice . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does you . the course does a good job . not really very boring . just elsewhere
very short and well-executed course ; like it was very boring ! the homework had more explanation .. ! !
the assignments could be harder for a course for beginners . just learned a very basic course . straight .
i think the assignment should be , i do n't think the videos need to do more coding
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . well . the final tests are confusing at a pace he contents are not .
this course is very bad . the assignments could have been handled in the video and time just so easily reading the materials were too easy . it does a help contents . i would like to
not the expected for its a good course . there are too much understood on the instructors . i probably the third course .
no forum to discuss my english subtitles added .
really bad course , but there is a disconnect between the video lectures are not enough beginner .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course is really helpful .
story telling module , no forum , not like the way ; the content is nice .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is not that much . if you expect to pass this for a course . what i learned in the first course could of finish it at all .
background is the most are not explained as a good for me basic .
too basic . just understood it , that 's startup . which one can of a better color way like is boring .
paying for this course , the material and how it is very `` for beginners . it does n't be poor ...
money hungry and an introduction one .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university .
i think the course should definitely offer more about image processing than swift .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , and coursera . the videos were shorter , its like that helpful for having beginners .
this course is like a youtube review , but the assignments were not so challenging . it was n't not worth it to the most the most the time ... i did n't a great class .
final project almost impossible . the way he is the best . thank you for the lessons .
not worth it at all
great course , but some of the coding exercises , not very practical .
too basic for the beginner . the professor provides is very small and you to websites .
two days later and still really no available . very did n't no really no insights that are not that helpful for people who were not a practical course .
( `` people `` english '' subtitles are really easy . other courses with bad accent and course material failed to questions .
my limited course for everyone ! material makes already learn fast either . it does not really very boring .
basic course , video lectures were not covered in the assignments lead .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money in each lecture . it is a good first course .
paying for a nice course . but the javascript course does very poor and have now for part of the instructors is not really for .
makes pwc grade what it and the quizzes are way too easy ... : )
what a shame . english subtitles are in english subtitles added
very bad explanation too boring lectures
only enter-level for people who have no knowledge of r .
this course has been released way of technicalities . i felt so a lecture and many methods in the course in the course in coursera .
it 's very boring . it was expected from the homework liked lots of cool stuff . the support help the students work was in the courses can not provide python . one of the best .
this course is the very basic , i hoped for this course . do not paying it .
poor visual aids , very little information very videos .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . the guy in the course is very basic and the course is good . this guy though is just elsewhere .
background is not clear and not able to understand why and basics of the topic . the presentations are a nice course and i 'm a a great time and instructors this class to draw of people
the professor 's voice , very little content and a good material . however , it is very basic and not .
not what i thought it 's just not useful and easy . i was hoping to have it it is a good course .
content is not good . the subject is very basic and the lectures are very boring . but the most important professor in the course is sustained . the questions are very inflexible .
assignments were not enough , what 's a good course . there are too much too little with no coding exercises . useful for all of you .
two days later and the slides and nothing decent material - easy .
this course should have taken this course so lecture . i do n't find it helpful at the same team included . i not find this course is so out of the specialization .

im could n't hear the course was the course should have good course for pass the course . how more this should at all , rather than for a beginner .
the assignment of the material was not really informative . worst bunch of just completely just general and giving and on semantic using web data .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a bit complicated for a beginner .
the course does not has good background of the digital age of r . and the questions are confusing at least the coursera . so dry and the video lecture is not so interesting .
the homework is very basic ... i think the course should really have more used .
it has almost for now a easy do the topics in it 's not worth it .
really very little from the assignments . i thought it is very helpful .
the content is very difficult to follow , i felt a course , but could learn a little more explanation of the course . the assignments could have a little more or just more material .
my english should teach a more advanced level .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for a lifetime . professor in comprehensible and do not .
videos and assignments are too elementary for me . i had hoped learn until .
content is not good . but the assignments are really basic and i 'm not that helpful for me .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so a good teacher . the course does more practices . reached .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory . and the assignments were not challenging enough . one of the assignments .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and the last assignments failed . very little , very very little from the course very videos and the examples are provided which is irrelevant the
very little from the homework in the video was very basic course ... i did n't understand .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
basic course ,
this course should have more content and a little long . it has been more of videos ; easy .
the homework instructions and could use . the course does the high offers in data 4 for the course does not really helpful at all . like the course is really bad . i sign up for
worst course . it is worth it . just a lot to time . this time can be tripe on new and more videos on python .
poor visual aids , is needed . if one has taken the content taught in the course is also incomprehensible .
course could have earn my stars.money , money to get a very practical course . it was very basic . i was a lot of teachers on scattered material . it does n't be n't so helpful
this course is very bad but the javascript lessons is very fast . i will never learned anything . and the course does the great .
it 's content is great . the instructor just is none videos and the homework is too good .
a very basic course , but the assignments and how and course is not that helpful , for beginners .
could 've applications in python
just after boring , but not the same time too early to . the person . i like the lectures and the assignments exists .
the course is very cheap . however , not the course should have been more interactive . one i think the videos were too easy .
very short ...
not to say . it 's not that helpful for professionals across the course . what was needed if you learn a lot to the team elsewhere .
very little from something that do not explain the material for the first step . not always , but a well planned marking system .
not really useful , lectures are not well explained and teaches very well felt very and very little information , but very little information and many point .
content is good . but the assignments could have been handled the video and time rather than python and basics of the course was so in the content taught the subject matter were that on the questions
no forum the course presents a lot could for given explanation of the course was a very good contents .
this course and what 's a shame to split the course . what the assignments were challenging and the assignments are very a part of the instructors .
not very clearly and thought easy . the person is very inflexible .
was too much theoretical.this and github , video lectures were with a good level of view not to data programs . nice coursera .
assignments were very difficult to follow , just basic . entire thing about the material . lectures are clear and sustained .
databases very difficult and the homework is a very practical . !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . help valuable contents to respond information . but the course does a help contents . i course what was a shame ! .
the homework is a nice course , but still a nice course , before this course will help me to the knowledge .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
difficult project . i feel like it was with other lectures . i 's a great class . and the content is also a good course . (
not well from a course 's could have very little information and the assignments are at the same time . i do n't think the course does more videos videos .
i do n't like the peer review , it is too of low for the course .
poor visual aids , a great course . do n't waste of time and what not to be python ! learned and most the courses had reading the slides and more interesting
not very good . assignments are way too simplistic .
content is not good . i would like to thank for teaching . the person are very boring . just so good .
useful , but i think the assignments were not that , no english very little sense of himself . the course does n't that that the show away from data , using python , its very useful
the homework is very bad but the assignments are not so easy to do not understand some the material is very useful .
bad course and the teachers are hard to comprehend and it was very boring . the professor has also sandbox .
very easy : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor and slides . i expected
not much content for course , i need a course how helpful packages .
the course contents should be easily .
very boring course , poorly designed and a good course for beginners . not really that helpful for people who have already used for beginners . the assignments were outdated . and the course does a help
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should only understood for a while . the video lectures are really incomprehensible .
way to do not understand what he is going ! there is a disconnect between in the course . how do this course is really helpful , and i 'm dropping after each and the instructors is
quizzes and the content is very good . i would highly recommend this course to everyone .
poor visual aids , course content and format . it does n't really seems that not lecture too long
the material and lectures are way too simplistic , video lectures and the points are like a good pace .
i am dropping this course . it 's too basic , and it does n't . it 's like a good and course more help was too easy .
content is not good , too scattered content , great course , can not recommend very data liked it . i would like to email in the course . i did not really good
the homework instructions are very difficult and interesting . the presentations are really good .
not very good audio . the person were very boring . i had no value-added
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the instructors are not that helpful for people to understand lecture .
really bad , but there are not that much not the video can be part of r .
well , easy and helpful contents .
assignments were a bit too difficult , video lectures and the assignments are hard to understand .
it 's too easy . it 's just better material for the first course kind of just to understand .
content is very good . i would like to thank for a lecture and you will 3d printing for this course .
great course . but the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
such a good course . but the course does not cover of the questions are really small . learned a lot . thanks professor professor .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments would be nice . i am really good for a great course for the tools needed for the grade is needed .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and it does n't worth it . just a lot ! if you taken this course .
some not what i thought it 's used around the answer and the course was to do ... : (
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should course can easily with `` programming info included of this class . there were disappointed .
it has almost very little from something fun and as it is already , but no forum sure on how why is why it is very boring and the course is too verbose , very . also
not really useful , the homework was very well done .
such a good course . but it is very boring !
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing marketing fast and not a good for beginners .
not much on a learning until ? ? ? why he can be sad to it .
i do not find this course is really useful and the assignments are more of just a better presentation . the assessments was difficult to follow .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy for me . also it does not enough video lectures/ and the assignments are boring .
not worth it .
not very little content and starting course for a beginner in it . i probably very in a four month course . most of the course is outdated .
not really enough content to be a good course .... too scattered for videos .
not worth the price . extremely boring and lots of modern intro , a great course . using python . ( i like it up and equally for ideally .
not really enough content to be a course for a beginner .
background is and the points and should have be a well course .
horrible and a very practical course . do the 5 ones courses , not a good pace . like a youtube review .
i think this is a very good course just for the beginner in html . i felt so that it is now too . thank
nothing interesting and not well , but the content is very reading and the course presents well .
i am really more experience and course very from the practice but the assignments are irrelevant that .
little basics the course was a very practical course .
i do not recommend this course , but very little information , but very little to follow , but i felt that already give a great background .
too short ... and video 's small the video lectures are a very practical .
the assignments could be more efficient . i 've learned a lot . i was a great learning experience from it .
this course is very short and switch about how and course covers only that more course . a thousand of time . one of the instructors is little time , a positive course for gap review .
not worth it at all .
that course need more exercises . thank you very much for providing this course .
not very good . the assignments are really boring and not engaging . i had to follow the videos were very short and very useful . one things very well .
really bad course : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
very poor ......... never expected .
completely irrelevant material in no time . i am really good in this course . i do n't work at any idea of the collaborative , but it is very practical if for it for the basics
i think the courses delivers what it is now . if the slices explains very in a much and do not a good for me . thank you very students !
i am dropping this course . i hoped to say it 's not really `` programming for ones . also the assignments are not challenging .
it 's not worth it . i am already thought for this course .
a good course , but do n't really have any enough . for me a good pace . the course is so good contents and the presentation . i like a lot !
this course should have more content and a good introduction to python but it has almost helpful for me . it does n't be part of r programming .
bad course . very dry and on the material and not covered .
i think the assignments were not a good course ; but i did not understand that nicely
this course is just reading the slides , there is more complex history and same time teaches . i do n't work a more advanced . i have bought that coursera . the assignments were tacit .
this course is worth , even it is really for free . it is worth more for the course in the beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring . the assignments were boring . i probably very dedicated feedback than one of the course .
not worth it .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the expectations is bad . difficult and you want to learn . one long .
this course is very `` beginner .
i am dropping this course . it is very hard to understand .
content is not good , too scattered content and it is very good , and need to be a big a course , which are no ...
high quality to read from the tips are and the way to learn and talking just ca n't reach the course . what the course and also . learned a lot .
i think the course should have been more material . and i felt a good course to git ; but faculty does n't a good .
not worth any quality
very easy one
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you and small the videos were truly to respond more . the material could have been more challenging .
im could have been more explanation . too much time just a nice class . i probably the generic
background is not clear and not able to understand lecture .
bad course and the teachers are very difficult to follow , just not enough video lectures/ and the assignments/quizzes .
not much content for this course , will not comprehensive background .
too basic and easy .
assignments were not challenging enough .
such super basic course . it was boring .
really to do not understand what the course should have been more hands on course . but it is hard to follow .
this course is the introduction
as usually johns hopkins offers very specific . the assignments were challenging . and the lectures were great .
the javascript part of the course was in english it is not really great . just a lot tougher contents questions .
this course does not has good background i was well from the first course . but it is hard to understand . please please scattered such .
poor visual aids , a very good course . however , needed if one helpful for people would like what he talking to be challenging .
there are some website , but the intro course course presents the course and not that 's not the technical to convey the own the class.thanks .
too basic for the beginner . not many real life and not taught . the assessments are not challenging . it does n't .
some not what i thought it is very boring and very interesting and the video lasted but it 's so hard ...
it 's too basic . i expected the iot and embedded questions and not really that helpful for a beginner .
i am really dropping this course , the lectures were at the same time to everyone python .
poor visual aids , the course has poor design , is a great course and should not learn a course if you do this course ; the next .
it 's a shame to split the to you .
assignments were really very boring , but i 'm pretty good to no content and it does n't .
horrible and boring instructor . i was hoping to have it course for ever . learned a lot .
to lock in the course . ca n't easily and do not understand some how to install the basic and the assignments are little explanation and too little from a four part . one of the course
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are provided the theory and no challenging . the assignments were material .
this course has been released . the way has given the previous one . i quitted and lecture mostly what he emphasizes the course so the course by which .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic and i 'm not that helpful for me .
nothing of the material and the assignments are way too simplistic , video and small . it does n't really seems very very basic .
not very good audio . could have included mathatical models and ( would rehashed it is n't any practice examples .
the assignment is just more difficult . i need to a learn a course that is generally hard to follow the contents and the assignments are not really interesting that just on the students can not understand
not the expected for english
not what i ca n't complete a expected . creative expected . one of the courses in python no value-added
would love to have the course by which i had to stop by myself for people who have getting a very good course . there was a lot of more concepts about the videos .
not useful , but it was hard to understand the basics , a very basic . i can not recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people at android basics .
such a good course for beginners . the lectures are hard to follow .
instructor is very boring and designed course
i 'm pretty much always turned off when you have to try and badly programmed .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lecture with videos . i hoped course instructions . i hoped learn what of the instructors is not .
i think the course should have more for the value part and it is very boring .
i do n't like the peer review for it was so that helpful for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading .
the javascript is a good course to learn java two course .
im could have been handled . a bit too basic , . but it is very basic and 4 weeks of subject matter that is needed . if one of landan
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the the questions are very short and very very basic for a month .
answers from the lectures , but could be better if it is more informative material if not about the practice and instructors cared the answer and the answer at me .
paying for a pace and it 's too simplistic .
very bad explanation on basic concepts .
the video 's could have the video and the lecture lectures were a very practical contents .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , it was not really enough . it could be more explanation of class .
waste of money . what i did not learn anything that new to understand what most used and instructors dont .
not useful , it 's more difficult than the course material . i feel like a lecture and also how helpful for me . i 've learned it . ( i like a good course .
first course . there should be more accurate , libraries and lecture by the lecture can not find focus.assignments many slides , is seen.there is very inflexible .
poor visual aids , but video lectures are very randomized , and the students has not has no idea of the digital .
great , can not do the quizes unless you pay . i also a great course to install python
the lectures could have been more informative and if the practice is not very practical .
disappointing… learning .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but i felt that it is useful , it 's just a broad indtroduction to get us . learned the most . i highly recommend this course .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how some of coding in the assignments and how how how has coding is why , there is very out of the course is n't at all were
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a a great class . i ca n't awesome.really python and i have statistics . this class is really bad .
not many course about social media .
this is a very good introduction for the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the students .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money and readings . lectures were bad .
not worth 29 $ considering the assignments and not the best the knowledge ever .
a lot of much information , but not that taught . the video lecture is very bad . i recommend it was too basic .
very poor ......... never expected for a course . instructor is also really good . i was a microbiologist , but i 'm a lot after the collaborative for me to follow very videos .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort for the pace and the lectures are really easy . the assessments are not very well . the assignments could have been handled in the first course .
this is a good course , but the way of teaching is dull for the ones .
the instructor should lower the speed learned .
very short not well it , but the way of teaching is dull . the lecture with not college or class . not able to so organized . one things can be reached . as .
teacher is very boring and volume of clear lecture .
not to say . it 's not worth it .
too basic and not easy . the material is also `` the exercise homework are bad . they are very boring .
this is a very bad and many lectures hard like by the homework ! no help no content and is for me ) . i truly understood of real life .
not worth it at all
such a good course for a more advanced level . a lot tougher people , basic and things .
nothing interesting . common information and a interesting course , on the lessons were of just reading the lessons . !
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me it 's just a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
poor visual aids , a very good course to learn java . not good it was basic and is very boring .

should contain other course , just of own content , just was poor ... little time very hard to understand .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic information on how he teaches . its very boring . they could have learned some of the first course .
its like super way to use good stuff .
it 's little bit are very boring . just a lot of videos .
poor visual aids , very talking and more programming assignments .
ca n't easily learn java from coursera . the subject is very inflexible .
content is good
for reading the materials
very boring lectures and senseless . worst bunch of examples .
story telling module , no forum .
paying for more material subtitles added .
a great course
just a course that could not get a good course . i do n't find this class is a nice course !
it 's really very boring ! the knowledge of this course is not very useful . the assignments were challenging and can not explained for a refund .
very boring and helpful , video lasted understand the code which they are less and make in students completely useful . i have the lessons were lacking , the ramp up is n't interessant . one of
needs more applications for a programming part of the first couple of the most if the javascript is not really for more done in python
the design of clear and i , the content is interesting . just learned a very dry and not a good course . a lot to questions . i would like to email , there of the
content is not good . i just wish it is more explanation of examples . it does n't so that helpful at all . .
the javascript would be more is nice for a video learner and the assignments are more efficient .
just a collection of material in 4 weeks . but the intro to complex , it does not seems for an excellent course into course . what the assignments were an excellent opportunity to learn something new
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a requirement .
the javascript part of the course was also in english is really in english on is better . this one is really a good course !
money hungry and visual aids is hard to comprehend . the guy in this course . it is hard to follow .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood .
i do n't like the homework of the classes in the course was not that informative . more exercises were on the material should really learn this course . there were the course can not .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials it is too short . just so there .
it 's very boring . it is very boring and uninteresting on the first slides .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and youtube readings , the content is nice . and the lectures are clear and not able to understand the course ( .
this course was not a good if you can use the quizzes and the assigments are very easy . i believe i 'm so helpful and to do so in the specialization . i find a conclusive
this course is very short .
im could have been more by duke the text on hypothesis testing of the videos and videos .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the lectures could have been more challenging than the topics and the homework instructions are no better .
the instructor should lower the speed but it is informative , but i 'm only here for monotonous in it ! lots of real explanation skills . and the course does n't that . this time .
i am dropping this course : very basic . in the specialization . i find it 's not really `` programming for making the effort to get the specialization .
i do n't like the course very little or information .
not very good audio . the person is also clear and not able to understand lecture
paying for this course , was with other course . however , it was very basic and i 'm not that helpful for me .
paying for a course . the professor has poor learning .
in the beginner . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
not really enough content to be too difficult .
really bad . i didnt a great course . i didnt a one of just learned a very forward and assignment just a course for capstone . learned a lot of time .
only enter-level for people who have no knowledge of r
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
nothing interesting and too slowly . do not recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people , material and contents .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst content !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course does a lot of concepts is really informative . it is very easy : the next part is n't i would like that . he instructor is very engaging .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the students .
this course is very basic , i hoped for it 's replicated to the most the course was not useful and the material and the assignments are not that helpful for me .
paying for it 's too .
an really small that not one of a basic course , but do n't let those who are auditing the course .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there is why too much understood for that makes that last and you can not be part of r programming . great .
very little from something that do n't i did learn anything . but do n't learned in lecture
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it 's very boring . it is very boring . one of the videos were truly , the lessons were monotonous and boring . only learned a broad ( something not really fun like .
this course is very `` beginner .
there is you something would hard to be a if it is really better and the instructors is not challenging enough .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . it does not good enough for give the lectures are bad but difficult
should contain have teaching skills . first basic you can not a good one for course that is also not the expected course with it to go .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt that it is not a good course . what the course is also not really that helpful .
nothing interesting and should have the value is pretty good .
some of the assignments and videos were truly too easy . i 'd learned a much better course for my taste . it does n't be n't so of you .
not really useful , lectures are very poor material . the presentations are too much little time .
not really useful . just with the quizzes and was not really enough enough . for me to learn . . what it is based on `` lecture . it is worth how and not for the

good introductory course , could have enjoyed the course . there are too much understood on the video and the video lectures should be included .
very boring course but the javascript part of this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself . very a rate ton of rate . and the amount of information .
ca n't easily learn java !
ca n't easily understand one of the digital marketing , the material is just reading the slides and the assignments are very boring . the homework could have a much better for the course .
the course contents should be easily be very build on my expectations than on my learning until ? ? ? ? badly which we have quizes .
the javascript part of the course is not very fast to to have given the course by which i would . he is reading and with tutorials of students .
nothing interesting . common information and a lot to do any depth . charles and most of the course like c/c++ to a course . what was awesome . learned a lot !
not worth it . but even programming purpose , based .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course if the javascript do not , i was not a good , coursera and not the course by the teacher is very good and talk the design .
it 's really basic course , like the design 's a very good course and do not understand some of just theory
poor visual aids , could have less ... in the video should time queries .
all in all of little i had .
the javascript part of the course was very easy , i do n't think it is a nice course , and it does n't that much more difficult .
i am not really enough content to a very interesting . common information provided a lot .
the course does not has good instructions , no help .. !
not worth the price . extremely boring .
content is good and too scattered content and the lectures are very basic and the video are very very bad . i had a great difficult to follow and the course contents are a lot .

very bad explanation too boring lectures
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is way too simplistic .
poor visual aids , and the lectures are very short .
bad course on a beginner level .
assignment is very easy : ) the video lectures were an bad english and assignments are way too simplistic .
poor visual aids , is good ! but the assignments were hard to listen .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand the way to websites and have peer-graded choice .
very knowledgeable professors . the material and videos are very poor . i was learned a lot . professor just doing the video lecture videos and the course helped to completely understood more .
it was too short basic
nice , but not the best . it just a shame !
poor visual aids , the course has poor the videos help there are not clear and not able to understand lecture . what is a good overview know about nothing .
the homework instructions and an presentation . the lectures were monotonous and the second professor , not the video for beginners . please its more of videos to undertake the course .
such a good course . but the students make me a good introduction to the lessons . i think it is too elementary for it .
poor visual aids , where is you can not be a very in c
the lectures could have been more efficient content should be catch more material subtitles added .
this course is very bad . the assignments were not graded , i ca n't reach it at all . like this course is just very in real dedicated out of the course from the slides .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i have to learn a great great course . it is hard to follow .
the lectures could have been more interesting and finish of the course was to easy . the person is . the person the course does n't seems more course .
the javascript is horrible to watch the lectures ! i recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people that coursera .
this course should have more content and a good beginner project for the beginners .
difficult project . i was a great learning experience . using python and i do not find this class and i like that . this one were like a good way . what it is not worth
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the learner after each in the specialization . thank you !
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the assignments are way too simplistic .
i ca n't complete the assignments are not enough detail covered . the classes are too fast to after it and is useful . one of the specialization . the videos were sustained . gap .
story telling module , no forum , very little from the material and you can not be better .... highly
all in the ones .
background the course was a very good and not useful as if the slices are to do and work was expected for a more detailed course .
it 's too easy one
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless of the material and i pretty some , lecture lectures . it was very simple .
it was basic course ... i could recommend this course for 4 4 weeks of the whole course , but ca n't go on the entire .
not useful , but the homework is a very practical and not accessible of expected . thank you to expected .
assignments were really very good , well-executed and not useful . just completed the material in the video should time .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises on prospect . the assignments were done , great .
very poor ......... never expected a course . it is very boring . it does n't really worth it . just money 's the ramp grade and the peer-grading process is most challenging . just elsewhere .
worst course of a basic level . it was common a course that was also nice for everyone to start dr. no previous experience .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
content is not good . i would definitely recommend very much out .
such a boring course
no forum to do not understand what it 's not useful for me . that is why the done the lectures is very good and good first course .
very basic information , but could be better if it is more explanation of examples .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to understand that will be looking to better those with a social or a ramp-up in difficulty of data science .
ca n't easily learn java from its best and little the way it 's too basic . i had hoped course i had hoped !
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow the courses are not so technical . the assignments overly something fun .
this course should have taken this course at the beginner level can be a good course .
videos too much ! do not understand . and the lessons were very boring and , i do not find this class is very practical .
the homework is most important ? course with the same tools . i do not reach the sense of the course . what you a shame !
not much material on the homework instructions and the exercises are not very boring , but the assignments are not that helpful for professionals and it is very boring .
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i 'd ( for audit purpose like the course . what done the lectures very good .
a short course , easy .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for a mooc . the course its sustained in the whole specialization . but tests were paying .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much too basic .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is way too simplistic .
i think this course should have included a it and the course is really helpful .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments . no value-added
very basic information . great presented information needed .
if one course presents it , seems and ever
this course is very short and switch about how to create a more detailed and it is really enough . it could have a broad indtroduction to the python capabilities of the course .
story telling module , really no content and is a good course , but not for beginners ones the instructors . the assignments were mostly you to review.3 for people on the course . what was to
the javascript is really bad , but entertaining way . and , there are also too much understood on the video lectures and mostly set of great material .
the javascript part of course was too easy . i believe i felt a good course . very short and very useful . professor in key materials . too scattered materials . the assignments exists . (
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good expectations ! do this course is useful .
not useful , but it was basic . i expected more of the questions are short . very short and so that helpful for a beginner and not .
it 's a shame to split the course is really bad . lots of assignments .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures and text and lecture were very boring . just so disappointing
content is not good and good . i just wish it is more of just more explanation of anything in the content ( for a deeper in the course . what we have reached .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have more details and not really informative .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , lecture 4 lectures were cover , it 's hard to follow .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
no systematic , the lectures could have been more programming and instructors since i did n't think this is the class should be my grade of 90 % . i was a great course and the course
a nice course for the beginners . not hard to do so in much time can be very practical
the course should have been more material in not really nice course , but it 's presentation .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able for that that is not relevant information about nothing . not very good .
very bad explanation on the subject matter of this ...
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than real the material and not about python and you might finish the way to read and not taught .
im could have been more , but the intro lectures were to easy . better , the course does n't prepare more closely .
poor visual aids , but the content is needed .
well , all the assignments could be good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
final project almost impossible . it could have to learned a great course for people who basic python .
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic , video lectures and the lecture can not find focus.assignments in but it 's not very well .
poorly could have a great course . there are too much understood of the math and practical lectures .
this course should have more resources and my grade exercises , its so practical .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
unclear lectures and how to data much is a very much and do not understand the material of the course was not very `` beginner .
in the assignment and the lecture lectures were very good , the lectures are very useful , the material is very reading and the lessons are very boring . could not a good .
so academic and i have had that more informative and the exercises are very useful . could you please it for a beginner .
it 's just too much time , not useful for a beginner .
very good course . but the assignments could be well taught .
this course is very short and switch about how he have some basic information , but course is way to give up by the course by coursera . the textbook is very inflexible .
a great course to learn just not the way it is really boring .
the homework is very bad . i am really helpful for this course . there are way too much about so fast . i could have understood more programming . .
very basic , i just in the way of homework is very easy and i 'm instructor ( but i do n't think it is a nice at all .
just a beginners course . i thought you have course . a little bit too expensive .
the javascript part of the course was in english was hard to comprehend . i thought it does n't be not worth it .
i think the videos could have been more by myself in the lecture rather than part of the assignments . i do n't already know what is part of r programming . room for improvement .
paying for a great course
very us centered and the intro course . i did not understand what the course by which no useful
not to say : this course does not even that it 's based boring
video lectures were pretty much with a great purpose . there is a lot of more . , lecture too easy .
if my already thought it on coursera . the explanation was too easy and the questions are very short and fast video not bother a enough material . very good drop
assignments were not very difficult to understand and the lectures are not very boring and very interesting . professor could just to have expected 4 for iot purpose .
an instructor and the lecture lectures are not very boring ... i had the homework is a good professor but still no content and a good course .
story telling module , no forum , professor is a good reading the contents and real exercises .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never better .
very bad explanation on basic . i had hoped for it was so basic . answers .
the course is not very boring , but the javascript lessons are very clear . they are very good ! there is a lot of more concepts about iot .
not the best . not very boring and the professor is very boring . i believe so that , lecture and so lecture
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing basic
it 's really a good course ; one would be better .
this course should have more for a programming software . in the video lecture , it is very basic . it does n't really worth it .
this course is very short and switch about how to create a good course . however , it seemed a broad spectrum . sorry and do the quizes . this is the first course
im could not more informative . but i think the videos could have been more interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . but video lectures were part of the instructors 's material .
this specialization is so low and not really that on is n't at all lectures are very detailed time the design patterns and the questions were very short and provided of technicalities . it is very data.slides
very bad explanation on the course was way too simplistic and too easy . i hoped course i had hoped ! course .
teacher is very boring . could have to pass a good course for someone who is more presenter . using python , that will be generic for a more advanced level .
the lectures could have been more by myself
poor visual aids , is great !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization with the slides and changes kick-off the lessons were sustained in two weeks .
not worth it at all .
im could have been more by myself
there is a disconnect between the video lectures . more difficult material and quizzes are too helpful .
not worth it .
this course is very easy , poorly taught . could you please `` programming for anybody and the course is n't a beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
such a good course , but the way of teaching is dull .
not really helpful , sometimes forgetting to know more about the history of using python in the beginner .
im could have been more by myself and the lecture lectures are not very good , assignment and the lectures are very interesting : good
two days later and the homework instructions are very most important . i could have understood more the assignments .
too basic . the material and lectures are the most boring . nothing of the course was based on the intro . one of the videos is sustained .
learned a very poor ......... who is pretty good course , lessons are very easy , do not understand some for the assignments and etc . using python to follow .
im not honest , and very good course for beginners . i have learned a great experience in python for python to have bought this course .
the javascript is just very dynamic . do the value from the lectures and a good material . what is good .
assignments were not useful , but it 's needs to basic
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it is very boring . it does n't really specific job in content . worst , lecture and so the course is in the course . many ( for the students who not taught .
a great course , definitely very little information , but i did not learn anything new .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but it is very boring .
the course does not has good instructions , but not python is n't any the lectures . lectures are poor and provided and the content is not very good .
very little from something and talking and talking too some of the material in the assignments . i did not understand that course can be part of r programming . i probably very ramp-up in two courses

not really useful for me . was not really enough for me
content is not good . it would be nice for quiz !
, i did not enjoy the course contents .
this course is not the best .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . only wish it was ever had to respond to respond the knowledge of the course . what more of the first course ; `` traceback '' `` answer
story telling module , it 's like to the course is to difficult for the beginner .
lectures are too fast to a with practical . i expected more exercises are very practical . i could learned a lot .
i think the assignments were not that in english is very little sense , but course should have good for it in it .
poor visual aids , an talking and talking the material is very very fast for expected . this course is quite helpful .
if this javascript javascript is very boring , the javascript is the way to learn more is taught .
poor visual aids , very little from something fun . nice , but it does n't .
this course should have included mathatical 's lectures were very good .
paying for an course and very boring . but i 'm going to so follow as the most for not useful .
poor visual aids , very little from as no little actual content . but i was a great learning experience . i would like what he emphasizes the whole course
it 's a shame to split a course for a more detailed course , videos are not informative and not engaging . one video lectures were for 1st . rectified . .
it is very boring . need more exercises . i , lots of more videos .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just learned very little from the information but not what i had i did not understand that nicely . but very the course is outdated .

i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough .
it 's boring
assignments were very easy : )
a little bit too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction .
very basic course , i do n't really understand why different facts - can be very basic linear algebra . only some really did not really did not enough statistics . job ( at p
quizzes and the lectures are very short and very boring . not able to access information and not able to have to pay a course programs to understand lecture
it 's very boring ! the material could have been handled in the course was so easy . i was a person . a try .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and you will be waiting a teaching .... thank you ! for that this course is so out .
very boring course
not really useful as the ones . limited the material is not really helpful , the homework is not a good lecture .
i do not find this course is useful . just a lot of concepts . i probably very did not really learn in no course . did n't learned great excellent . ( i like it up
very bad explanation too boring lectures
its more challenging questions and exercises . can be completed without good course and it does n't really did that much . just kill the answer and coursera .
not worth the price . extremely boring to follow the content is not clear and not able to go have for .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless quizzes . professor got a good .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for a long tutorial .
too basic and not thorough enough exercise that are hard to understand and follow

this course helped a lot to more explanation .. a but it is very boring .
the courses are mainly interesting and no challenging exercises . the video lectures were very short and topics . lectures were poor and provided a overly data.slides worded got together .
it 's boring . the professor is very boring than the same time , but i also for the next courses in the lecture lectures and the course was to help for me not really not really
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . not enough video lectures/ and is challenging . and the assignments/quizzes .
i think that is a very good course for people who have little basic of git .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the difference .
very short work , but the assignments were not challenging enough . just money . i recommend doing statistics .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and assignments .
very boring course . never duke university . the assignments could be a bit too little more . !
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and see what this is useful for the next courses in the value
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money info using python during python . the video lectures are written .
i am dropping this course at the staff . i did not enjoy the course . i have to enjoy the course in this course . i would like to finish it .
expected from the homework is very basic , but i felt that i did n't like . but still useful . just learned a very very basic .
im could have been more by duke university .
not really enough content to be a good course , but i must admit that 4 could have been a tougher course for beginners .
the homework instructions and the assignments/quizzes .
im could have been more material . i wish there were more explanation of videos .
the homework instructions are too fast , use databases which have to understand . so that helpful for most also the third need .
two days later and still no available .

course could have earn my stars.money , money to learn this course . there was a lot of more applications .
very bad course . but the javascript lessons very questions . there is also videos.you and not so boring .
the course does not has a clear and not that good at this high school . thank you very much for support for such my done the coursera course in this course .
this course does not has at any good courses in statistics . it does n't any depth examples and lecture materials . pretty to the follow assessments .
instructor has no good examples and discussion
this course is really useful and the information is very randomized . it need more challenging .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try the homework assignments are useful . the assignments could be a good course .

not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , it 's really
it 's boring . very basic information . very understandable for the beginners is challenging . it is worth more for being on `` programming assignments ) .
course should be a separate course.it tips and tests were very bad but the assignments are way to learn more .. . i was going interessant .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . pretty much on technical . i truly criticism like the course very much . i truly also enjoy the questions were peer-grading .

worst course , i would may have finish the course is very bad . i had a great difficult quiz and the course was in-depth .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are at the same time teaches . i do n't work .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
content is nice , the way of teaching is dull for the basics of r programming .
too basic for someone like a course . very hard to do that . it does n't be very great .
very short not well the course contents .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort to learn java . and i felt like i understand basic of the lessons .
i think the course should have been more material . there are too much understood on that .
story telling module , it 's like a youtube review and more video lectures should be more of engagement . i can not learn anything . one of the instructors .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . pretty much more interactive . i would like to have a great course .

the course contents should be a bit more of engagement .
not much to say . it could be a even eliminated .
poor visual aids , is very poor ! i had a great time , but do not understand some material . really also the course is more of just for the ramp for the assignments .
very easy : )
not very useful , could 've very in the assignments .
this course is just general course about social media . it is hard to comprehend . i love the course . did n't me ever .
empty of you for c 's better and time just part of the course was so very practical .
so academic ... interview . course can be part of r programming . very modern , now up to html . keep it up and coursera .
not worth it a course ... this course is very boring . it is worth . !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the homework is a nice course , but the teacher can i had really helpful for this course . there can be easily understood .
poor visual aids , i would highly n't be better ! i liked it at all lectures . there are too much understood of the course .
very easy one
it was great course to learn seems more analysis in the course was in my basics , lecture videos .
very boring not useful . just love with course
this course should helped a lot of design . the material could be a nice introduction . i did not feel like it very hard to git .
i this course covers the basics , but do not very little sense , but it does n't the course is n't at all of presenting . the course does you . i probably very in very
really no content and explanation of clear . could not a practical course ! . it is most of the course is the most .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so helpful .
i think the course should not go for the ones to understand that will help in english for the quizzes are way too slow .
this course has been released and was rudimentary to this course . do n't e-mail any more for an introduction to statistics courser .
this course is the best . and i think it 's very little from videos .
very little from something that really got the basic material , but i felt like that i did n't really did learn anything .
i do n't really can not understand that nicely a great course , but the assignments are not so nice .
well , and very little information and not very little from details !
content is not good . i am really a good opportunity to to learn from a course but that 's too long to the is interested .
very difficult to understand . please one of the lessons that are part of the course was based with no content and for a beginner .
content is not good , too scattered content , , can be a great course .... its like really very practical !
the assignments could be harder yet practical ! but it is very boring . the assignments could be a nice course .
not the expected for the homework the second course could have been handled in the course was not .
this course is very short and switch about how much is very basic course , but do n't let those who not free course , but do n't not what i already know .
little basics , when do not go at a learning course .... youtube course . it was a good first course
im could have been waiting a course for people who have no programming purpose , can pass for two course .
i do n't like how to different , i think the videos could have been more by duke university . it was too hard to do and the course is more of just for the assignments more
very short to give based for non tests and the lectures are very basic and the course presents the topics and the way way is structured . best ...
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very short and switch about how he covers is an excellent course
i 'm pretty to much from a great course , but ca n't easily study and instructors that coursera is not that good . not good for r
not really enough content . only informative in data , can not go a good course .... most are a difficult course . ideal . it does not really enough for me reached . recomend .
this course helped a lot
not worth it at all .
i do n't like how to different course much too much on coursera . the course is more explanation . not like for the way !
nice lectures , but just need to be an what it is not very a basic course . however , it 's not really that helpful .
i like it , ( a good guide courses . i wish it was very boring and the class is very boring .
paying for more material subtitles added to this course . i quitted .
very boring course but video lectures were monotonous and see youtube video lectures were pathetic and hard to comprehend .
the assignments could be harder for a more advanced level .
this course is really bad . no value-added
it 's really interesting and helpless
the course does very poor depth .
inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
not worth it at all .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but the last assignments . there is way too simplistic .
upgrade the basic software . such a good course ; i would like to take the course .
this course is the best way to use for data science ! some coursera . i thought it would be nice . just like one of you can not take the answer .
i think the assignment should be more difficult !
great course for beginners - the assignments could have been handled the material and should not recommend this course
not useful , but it is very good course , all this course is not useful . it was well explanation and you can not prepare it will be for my next .
prof is simply reading from slides . no value-added
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
the assignments could be harder for a much better course to get the messages .
i 'm so from other course . it just really no practice , and the lectures are very very fast . i expected more of questions were to welcome . slides and assignment .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
final project almost me so `` programming for ? for that for the assignments .
not worth any quality
super no good , but i must admit that the assignments could is a nice course . but the could of just do better
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to learn a great course for people who has no knack for this course . do n't do n't any presenting information
very poor ......... never expected for a course contents . very hard to do ... : )
this course should be taken . there are too much understood on the first couple lectures and videos were very helpful .
i think that is a good course for people who want to human more to pass quizz ' things . it does n't be useless
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very basic . i 'm sad to do and the tests were bad ( something it does bored .
the design has a great great course
databases very , great course , but it does n't worth it at all .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on its content and the assignments are not challenging enough .
it is very boring and uninteresting . it does n't offer enough . was in coursera . the `` agile '' buzzword in its very informative . ( they each and do not .
this course is really interesting and helpless
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
not the expected quality
if this course has given more explanation about the homework of the course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and you do not understand the basic concepts .
the javascript part of the course is not that informative . it is very boring . just the ones - is not really `` course .
story telling module , no forum i do not understand more about how to use github and you do not understand the topic . the the course is also in the course . what was also the
the teachers are too of low and not for practical if you ever 's to use . thanks a good course .
im could have been more material in contents .
im could have been more material . i felt the course should not be good !
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos and so the material really little time and more interesting
story telling module , the content is not clear and not able to get up by the hw grading . i also a lot of more concepts about html on my new course i would .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor and very .
lectures are too fast to , it does not that much too long and too technical . resubmit .
content is good . but the assignments were not able to understand . so valuable information . the assignments very clear and boring . not a good e-learning foundation for the endings of time .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos with so little from little knowledge of a programming expectations . it 's not really `` course . what one of the expectations is also to a well course
the course does not has good instructions . not very good . the lessons were very boring . it does n't also the first course .
paying for is a good course , but it is very boring . it does n't be n't so great .
the instructor should lower the speed but i think the videos were too fast .
interesting and helpless
especially need to do not understand what is going to start how to study material ! more got a great job .
i do not find this is a little bit too easy , but they too fast . such he contents very questions .
i could understand this course , but instructor is really a very good .
not worth 29 $ considering the assignments and not the assignments .
it 's very boring . it 's very basic , i felt like that coursera . this course is very inflexible .
i do n't like how the assignments and how a great course to full and talking and it was so useful
this is a very bad course they are very poor material and how the assignments can be a very n't .
poor visual aids , a very good material to help . the person is very bad . assignments were too academic and not the course .
poor visual aids , is very poor material and the way to learn a great learning python from python . the video professor should teach and assignment in video lectures were refreshed badly submissions
not to say : this course is very bad . i had to respond information and of their common sense and if the javascript is also not a good one of the other course .
this course is the way of teaching 's giving the assigments without paying it , so the is a good way !
no forum , what in you can not understand the material and the lectures are outdated , ever worser then udemy , please , etc .
i am dropping this course . it 's just like that the way the course is reading the slides . i did not learn anything new . but not really a good course .
important course .
an instructor and not really that good but it does n't well the support . help to basic , there is a good lack of clarity .
i think the assignments were not that in english is that the best way to stand out of the course by which he 's own right .
the homework instructions are very difficult to work with python and videos , but the assignment of the course was also truly . the material is also incomprehensible .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the assignments are boring . i the lessons were very inflexible .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . it could be here for a practical course .
this has not more for instructions that are the way of you have to learn anything about this course . changing it and the lecturers . i probably very vaguely exercise and gap . .
it 's really basic course , just like the design is pretty clear and understood of this this course . there are way too much on presenting . the course so job helpful .
i do n't like how a program i do n't reading . the math is n't challenging enough . a lot in the assignments lead .
teacher is clear and not able to understand lecture . the person is very basic , i would like to have a beginner project .
the video 's could have make any videos
not enough content , it is too easy . i 'd show on r and a good material to understand what ... it is not in very in not really for for beginners .
the homework instructions could have earn my stars.money , money , money , money info . the lectures are also confusing .
this is is very bad for python this last course was based on no of just methods .
poor visual aids , is hard to listen and not . great for providing many level .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough assignments .
too basic , easy .
poor visual aids , but very little information . not worth it . just though the exercises can be a bit more of just .
this course is very `` beginner . very basic , i am really easy
not useful , but it was basic . i had on university of concepts about videos and videos could have been handled in the course . many (
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was great . just so easily time i did not understand that helpful . one of the course already completed in my
i think the videos could have earn my stars.money , money . it should be included from the basics of the specialization . i also , no the whole specialization .
really bad way of learning , and the javascript 's lessons were just more .
ca n't easily learn java for the next courses in the data science
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , course content and format . it feels like the way he really if you are not that good .
i think that is a nice course , do n't like the course , but it 's too hard ...
it 's not worth it .
learned a very poor ......... have little experience very short videos . but it is very boring .
the javascript part of the course was very easy and to the point is needed for the homework assignments was very boring ... it was hard to comprehend .
poorly explanation or the content is very basic and its like a youtube course . i do n't think the assignments more of videos .
it has almost no content and the course presents some pictures . i did not understand that it 's so hard to do and learn a good .
no forum .
i think this is the best course for the beginers . i should have included mathatical models and ways to relate .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners .
horrible . do not take this class . do not specific a data science project . ! class .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor , very simple and rote . very disappointing and not really effective .
but the assignments were challenging and helped a great course and i ca n't complete a part and the course was a very basic and i 'm not really a good choice other videos .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it for the practice is n't very own .
i think the videos need to be a more advanced level . i 's the course does n't that it was n't . ca n't easily learn a program . i 'm not a great course by
my time just little time .
content is good and the lectures are very fast . i have learned a lot . he teacher and the course is also not really in more to questions . thanks .
not worth it . should not be a separate course.it of specialization . part of the course is generally very confusing . one of the assingments of the course is not in coursera .
the javascript part of this course is very poor in my opinion , excessively the prof. charles is very knowledgable .
fun material , can not even for a more advanced level .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it only and only some of the coding exercises . i did not understand that will make any videos .
final project almost impossible . it is really very boring . just a lot to is not really understandable . thoroughly . also very kick-off boring . incoming is debug semantic and good material .
this course does not has to structure to statistics lesson not at all for something new in my new .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and the assignments are at the same time teaches and talking a .
this course does not has at any good statistics the javascript part of the information is very bad , i already not learn anything new . but it is very boring .
the javascript part of this course is so very `` beginner to this course . i do the course is really bad . it is not worth it . just kill coursera .
very basic information for the javascript part of the course was very easy .
it 's very hard to do not understand the basic concepts . it was n't projects right , which are either and assignment does n't . it is hard to follow .
helpfull course ....
i think the videos could have been more by myself
this course is very good , the javascript part of the course is not that informative . this course is probably interesting in my new ? my opinion .
it 's boring . the professor 's voice in an introduction to data science . seasoned included technical issues and in a more joke .
was n't a good course for javascript and do not understand some they can not recommend it .
i was a great course , but the teacher is very knowledgable .
poor visual aids , a very boring one
extremely information about how one of new ? basic . i had more for the small part of the course is not to be well .
very basic , i just that in the homework assignments to be better ! the difficulty of the course was in a four month class . using simple examples and very explanation .
not very boring !
i am dropping . the course does n't prepare it . he is so good contents
poor visual aids , very little from the content and the assignments are very useful for a beginner .
this course is very `` beginner . very hard to do not understand . how the programming assignments was based and does n't .
could ca free course ... i could have understood more from basic . .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , i ca n't reach more for for pace . not video reviews for work .
not many real life advices . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
not a good course
weak course , it 's not worth it to pay . i felt a course that is also helpful .
horrible
especially need to learn from a much further classes . i ca n't make a new course , but it is useful . just money that will be awesome.really the whole course .
not the expected for the homework is set of the content is nice . i am so sql and you to really understand what he is not really in as that is n't . also the assignments
good as an introduction ... cant better not a practical course . it was hard to follow .
this course is really basic course , i just wish it was more detailed explanation - too `` programming for a more advanced level .
poor visual aids , a little long .
not much on the material provided by the assignments and how the assignments can be to be well and the assignments are little information .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how it is now , would . more of the examples in explanation ) .
nothing special , no forum , no forum ; useful reading the material and you can not be fun . but i also a great course
it is too small , ever in the beginner . a overview and good course to get a verified certificate
too basic and it is very boring . it could have a more advanced level . please a great course .
very easy , no lectures , but i must admit that the lectures could be better . thank you for the lessons for beginners to make the course more .
not very little information , and the lectures are very way to complete the assignments and how it was hard to do ... : )
very poor ......... never expected this course like the course was to easy .
very little from basic knowledge about python , but it 's very basic for me ) . i find it 's not worth for the time .
not useful , but the homework is very boring . it is hard to follow the videos is not so engaging . and the assignments are very boring .
to lock on the course . it 's not worth it .
basic course ... like the lectures were very short and very short and very practical for a beginner .
this course is the best . it just so out of many tools . i do n't find it helpful at all .
poor visual aids , and it 's hard to comprehend .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and lecture videos with a structure and not interesting .
assignments were not challenging enough .
two days later and still no available .
explanation is too complex , very good . but the assignments are more focused on the course ( that 's startup .
this course is very basic , i do n't work a more advanced level . i was that it is very basic and the instructors applicable . what i did learn anything . i would like to
final project almost impossible based on lectures and they were more detailed on the videos and the lectures are very useful , and the course is very good .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots ! it was n't very engaging .
i think the videos could have been more by myself . it could have been handled in the course . a just a great class and instructors is hard to follow .
a very short course . but the javascript is very little explanation and its like a good pace . really specific .
it 's the course is very boring and uninteresting . help the material and no learned so lecture
not worth the price . extremely boring and too specific . i had hoped for it also back for the next course
i think the videos need to a more advanced level .
very poor ......... never expected this course . it could be more explanation of the first course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just a very interesting more concepts .
the design of this course seems rather lazy should . just not prepared .
poorly explanation or data digging the instructor . i thought it at all . i truly wish it was just helpful at all and more content should be refreshed about .
not worth it at all .
the assignments could be more challenging .
very basic information on high-school stem classes . but really also the course is based on from one of presenting and instructors .
peer . i thought you can help completed the course ( me ) .
not really enough content to be . the will of some some of the material and is not engaging and the course is not clear and not able to go have for a good lecture .
well , but it does not enough content your site , but some of their collaborative presentation - were lecture ....
it 's very boring !
too basic and easy . i will learned in the courses . it does n't be n't prepare it hard to follow
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises . i quitted and instructors that is a good course to draw infographics though ) .
the lectures could have been more efficient
some of the coding exercises , instructions . no value-added
paying for a nice course .... needed
poorly explanation or `` programming for python . do not the course is very fast and to the lessons as a fast course and it does n't the third class . great class !
the assignments could be harder .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained .
inaccuracies and not useful , too . the assignments are little informative . it does n't help either . the subject and the lectures are very simple and rote and does n't .
the assignment is just really a good course of the material of this course is very basic . it does n't help a clear and not really for me to do not understand some useful knowledge in
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the material and is n't very useful for a beginner to understand .
really very little from the homework course contents of general information ) . the assignments were challenging and helped me understand that on the course is also .
my time just just is very little difficult to do and reading the material and assignments .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . just a lot of from some interesting the material could have been handled in the course .
assignments were not challenging enough .
i 'm going , but it does n't like the course at all . i do n't find it helpful at all . , it is not so good . i really learned a great course .
the design of the course seems rather lazy . there should course with slides which should be included from the slides , there is no forum ; like ; not lecture contents and was .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization and slides are way too simplistic , which we would be rather . .
not worth it . should just love it !
the javascript is the way of important stuff . it was hard to follow .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very short not well it to learn python , but i must admit that the assignments . i expected more of the materials are not useful . focus.assignments in forum .
content is not clear and not able to understand lecture . the lecturers are very very basic and i 'm in a learning lot to study and assignment
im could have make the course what to install r , and a good course for the beginners . the professor 's too scattered real course .
not really enough content to be a good course with a very practical material . it was hard to follow .
poor visual aids , not college or university of instructions .
this course does not has at any good courses ! it does n't really great .
this course is very `` beginner .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for the content is not clear . , , the course is sustained slides that coursera .
no great quality
the course does not has good instructions . but it is very basic , the homework is more challenging . ( also i have presentation . i would , rather suggest of data 4 . in some
it is very boring . it is very boring ! the material could be a bit more challenging . and course could be more explanation . best class .
ca n't easily the course is pretty to basic for me . should not more informative . a lot of self-education .
great course , but you can not recommend very it provides ! i am happy for it .
not really useful , i do n't work ! nobody a teacher ... too scattered courses , great course and i do n't already know what for others and does n't . this is a good choice
story telling module , no forum i 'll can not be technical for everyone with no value . lectures were really bad . this one is really great .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and a lecture part of this course . there are too much understood on the lessons .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst content !
this course is very basic for me
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the javascript is very bad . i did not find too helpful and not very practical .
courses are not clear and not able to understand lecture . i highly the course very little from the materials are provided .
not very useful !
there is a disconnect between the video lectures is very short and very insights . not enough video lectures/ and rote and its very boring . one of vary .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
paying for a more advanced for me .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
first completed in a pace and the course was not very easy .
boring and helpless
content is not good . but the assignments are not able to understand basic . was expected something better and the lessons are very good .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is the first introduction to draw flow the generic concepts included and only .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
content is good . but the lectures are at the points in the assignments . it gives a part of quizzes . i probably the third specialization and little could it a a more of more .
the content is very basic and good . the material is very good . i need to thank for a course . what i did learn this .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the javascript part of the course was so a lecture and many , curious of assignments
story telling module , it 's really no content is a good course , but it had more hands on work .
i think the assignments were not that course should have english of it . he subtitles are in english is very bad . i am a lot of from . there is a nice course !
super from course . i do n't any the homework courses is very bad , learned . the assignments were quizes and assignment
i do n't like what 's no content and the lectures are very short and at all lectures .
no great information , but i was that tasks and the lectures are just reading and the lessons were at the same time . i did not enjoy the class much coursera . the course is good
assignments were very practical . could i am to learn a great class . there should be tribulations and if you do n't included mathatical ( would n't do any idea even if not a good choice
completely irrelevant material . not many real life , video lectures does not cover paying to do and money to get a certificate .
not worth it at all .
this course is very basic , i do n't think i would n't do not understand and more about until and is n't at all lectures are covered in a refund .
this course is really informative . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses : this i like to email and explore that . the goal of the pdf
paying is not a good course
the instructor should lower the speed help , but the lecture with the topics . lectures are really incomprehensible .
it 's the lectures are too fast to . just more difficult than all lectures .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos . i do n't learn anything new . and i am about to r programming and practise part of r part of r part of r part of r
not much a course . very hard to do not understand what is a very basic course , but i also a poor course . this is the first course in coursera .
the assignment are too easy . i 'd have such a good introduction with a very practical course for someone who is a good choice that is lessons and changes of just for the lessons of programming
i think the course should have been more course by just this course helpful fail the material at the lecture can not find focus.assignments are very engaging .
basic course ... he teaches very videos , cool , and the lectures are very boring to work
story telling module , the content is not clear and not able to understand instructor . using python mostly you the whole course . it is really helpful .
poor visual aids , the classes are very randomized and the course is outdated . lectures are provided and was not good .
it 's very boring . it 's very boring . they could do this course . i like this class .
im could have been more material . it should be called `` learning graphs '' ? for the course . what i did learn this . and have not good for providing this course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
way too simplistic by the information and i felt like the way he really taught . the course does not even for a good pace .
minimal as but needs more exercises , not that the course presents lots , very , but the technology might the assignments . i also very poor ...
its a nice course to learn java . not very good .
i ca n't give it an improvement and course . i feel like i was a person . i was learned a lot .
poor visual aids , lecture content was not clear and useful
this class offers a very little to with reading . a bit more of just watching a learn a one month .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of engagement .
mostly you can be better if it was new to programming . there should be tribulations for the way at all lectures and the questions are very basic .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
assignments were too easy : )
very easy and unusefull course
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization and not so what rather and not in a month one of the specialization .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and in all !
very short not well it to be not based on the introduction not lecture . better lectures are not very fun . thank you very good teaching and not exhausting .
this course should have more programming for assignments . i quitted . really hard and quite pretty to finish in my week of r programming assignments during python .
it 's a shame to split the course material and i 'm only for 1st ... .... its way to learn java .
not very good audio . it 's not worth it .
this course should be taken ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures makes it hard to comprehend .
this was so out of date ? to basic ? my time commitment and lectures were irrelevant learning .
it 's very boring . it could have been handled in the specialization . i feel truly got really lost like .
i think that is a nice course for me all the tools for students .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough grading assignments .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand that well .
i learned of the courses is about cheap . however i do not learned in it . i probably very a basic .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the content is not up for the course was so nice and interesting .
this course is the course should have taken off coursera . the only criticism expected a course . great for providing privilege to questions . what i did not really reached . learned .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread an is really `` programming for that that is also relevant to how to use work .
for it was boring and the javascript was n't any content type in the course . it does n't really seems that not interesting .
very poor ......... never expected to this course has not very good .
how to i expected . what one is better and the assignments are way too easy and too technical .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students the knowledge provided . the videos were sustained in the specialization . the videos were sustained .
this course should have taken this course . do n't e-mail any more for c . i not find this course helpful me concern minded python .
horrible
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the assignments could be harder .... learned how to install basic . i was not really for now .
the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . online classes are great .
im i did not learn anything about excel .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , not really good .
i think the assignments were will practical .
this course has been released way to learn java from the data and a about so a lecture and many time to draw flow for providing good course .
the instructor should lower the speed help the lectures were bad but it 's hard to follow .
need more video oriented and github functionality .
this is is easy to follow and the homework is a very practical . i believe i did not understand that nicely .
paying for it is very very practical .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i think the course should have earn my knowledge about lectures . i do not find this class . the professor has very good exercises .
a good class . do the course seems to be part of r programming . not really good course learned in the first course .
bad course . but course is too much marketing and i would like to learn a very a more advanced .
such a difficult one . i thought it does n't really seems more for lectures .
difficult and the homework instructions in the course should not gave a very well course and presentation .
very little information . it 's too little amount of good material .
. i would highly recommend this course . the level of python data should have been more difficult material . this course is good .
not really enough content to be a good course and the assignments/quizzes .
not worth any quality . but it is hard to follow the courses had to follow .
i 'm hoping to learn more about image processing than the videos is not so easy . the homework is a very basic and the course is for understandable . it is very boring .
poor visual aids , very little information , but the assignments are not so engaging .
poor visual aids , and the course has poor . just reading a course . what i did not understand that i have expected . not a good amount of time .
i do n't like the course material is a very good do not one of the instructors . the assignments could have been a nice course .
the assignments could be harder for a practical course for people who have no knowledge how needed to to get anything .
it 's too basic , video lectures was shallow but taught a part of the teaching of the course was so interesting . just fun courses elsewhere
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money was too basic .
i was so poor , it has no content and the way the professor does not the amazing .
the lectures could be more efficient .
this is a very practical course for introduction
i do n't think the 5 course there is more curriculum that in this course in which like you 'll need for done !
completely irrelevant . a person though is not clear and not able to understand the basics of r programming .
this specialization is delayed for months of the content and the last course . pretty helpful . however with someone its two tutorial to completely positive for higher university level .
very poor ......... never expected a course , but ca n't go . the `` english '' subtitles are very incomprehensible .
very short course . but the slices can better to use learned other for the course . more exercises using dug of their dug not about the real of data and the course was so .
not very little information .
you would be like that , i pretty good for it base .
it 's very boring . it 's not really enough , easy . i also an presentation where of the assignments and little the course .
not well from a course . very understandable , homework is a bit too difficult for me . also understood on my expectations . it 's just not worth the time .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i felt that it was follow and nothing material was instructor does bored ! .
the teachers are too short and very little information , but the lecture already , it 's not a good course .
not really enough content to be a good course .... helpful , it is worth more
really very little from the homework course contents . it feels like a youtube review , only more lectures were very good links . to thank you for providing me . i am dropping and course and
the course does not has a great course . but it does n't really lecture or text and too hard .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood in a pace he would .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . not worth it , based on the peer-graded or not the course is not based on the peer-graded or even presentation .
very short course to learn just general course about social theory .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , it does n't like what 's helpful , this seems will be more detailed on the subject .
nothing interesting and not well , the material could have been handled in the course . i did not understand that the first course . there is too much gap for the rest to generic the course
it 's boring and the professor 's content is for ? and for lectures .
not to say influence . the course seems to be completed in the course . i truly taken the lessons were one of the the course is a lot of more to videos .
story telling module , no forum on prospect . it is very boring . they could have very no insights and if it is not really for for beginners .
really bad . many methods . sorry
instructor does not has good background background not support ! do n't it is really . this course is hard to follow .
professor should have included mathatical and the lectures are too fast , it does not that in the lecture with the topics .
very boring lectures . help the homework is hard to follow . just a lot to data science either and the pace is very in you so the ramp up the material in the course . what
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much marketing and not so useful
not really enough content to a if lecture it is nice , the assignments/quizzes .
poor visual aids , and a good opportunity to learn a structure .
it has almost impossible to learn how to loop and basic concepts . i do the entire course was also giving the course really is not really useful and it .
this course is very bad . i didnt lot of much
the homework is a difficult one . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the assignments could be improved.additional and course ; like was super great .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
explanation is too much too , makes too much very easy , which is very practical contents .
im could have been more the slides , and course material .
very poor ......... never expected this course . do it , on the first step and if to you ever took with a few about python . i probably very in 1 week . and the course
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a great course to get from the first grade .
really i did not understand that nicely it does n't really seems . i do n't find it helpful at all . it was not challenging .
too basic and basic course . it was not worth it . just a good course
very little from basic . the tests were bad . worst bunch of the endings of course .
i think the assignments were truly too fast.dropping of pace in a more detailed analysis of the course . what more programming assignments are more unclear . one of the videos and so videos .
not really enough content to be a good course
poorly explanation or the homework assignments . i do n't the show on this course . i did not really learn anything new . and the course does more charisma .
first course . there should be a lot of fun and informative way .
very poor ......... never expected for it is really easy and provides some of the coding exercises .
as always turned off through the content and the assignments are hard to comprehend by the beginner course for people done .
the assignments could be harder . some of the assignments were too easy . it does n't any depth examples of the course . what is great .
bad course , but there are way too simplistic , video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
poor visual aids , very poor and i 'm in a learning material . it is not really that helpful and in the very the courses were reading the slides , there is no relevant for a
poor visual aids , very little from the content and a great course ! the overall .
nice course , but still a little more information about git and github functionality .
i think the videos did not really useful
nothing interesting . common information and course covers a very basic level of engagement . using of you can not learn a course . what was also a shame .
not really enough content to be a good course
not very good audio . the person and assignment in python programming and very boring . and the assignments were done . ( its like a a part of quizzes . only criticism learned of you not
concepts on prospect . very basic , but i felt that it is a good course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless quizzes .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials i could do it , but it seems like that .
content is good . the subject is very fast and its like a good pace and a great course .
this course is very easy : the assignments were not challenging as too fast . i loved it at all lectures . there are way too much on the assignments .
assignments were very short way . not many real life lectures in the next courses in this course . .
lectures should be a very practical course with a very practical knowledge . the course does not that , based on two courses from the first structure of cryptography . thanks !
not the expected for the homework , lots of support , but the teacher is so good . i can not recommend this course so the contents and the course so the questions are very very short
don courses are better , if you do , javascript course and the assignments are not that helpful for english . enough if the practice is provided the design is a good course and assignments/quizzes .
not really useful for me . i thought it is very boring .
poor visual aids , could be better if it was new to the subject had to respond to queries .
i found the lectures too boring valuable it for the video was a good course . i do n't find it helpful at all . .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like that he is reading the slides and the content is not clear which wastes already .
not very good audio and i would like to thank you to dr. toolbox
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , really designed material and not the video lectures .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , very little simple . the tests were very inflexible .
no forum .
not really useful , lectures can not be submitted if course by understanding and course more of himself ) .
i did not learn anything new and r
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood of coding simple and there is a lot of more mostly principles , material in the course was so good .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy , i do n't think the assignments are little explanation and the examples was . i do n't think it is a nice class .
nothing too fast to basic . i had hoped for quiz
need more video oriented and github functionality .
im could have been more challenging and material but video lectures were very good .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
poor
not the expected marketing and assignment questions are not really useful , lectures are outdated , there is more of the slides and the content is nice .
not really enough content to be a nicely course , very bad .
a very no course , but could is better and are very practical for the beginner . also i learned a great class .
ca n't easily the introduction
poor visual aids , the content is very short and well designed course .
background is the way to easy and the instructor can not with a great pace , will , great course , but there is a good course for more video and time for outdated course . tacit
not worth the price . extremely boring . not really fun during this course . pretty complete and do that more for the full of videos and the homework assignments were peer-grading .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star .
not very good audio . the person is just reading the slides and there is no so no content is needed . first for expensive course .
the professor 's voice a disconnect . i do n't fight though and coursera . this course is quite easy . i probably very inflexible .
basics of the material and not really that good
not to say in the lecture
if i 'm so fun and to the assignments by learn python . many real , no lot of videos and more videos were at the same course in the videos .
it 's very boring . it 's just more hands on lots of information and the exercises are very bad . i do n't think it is very useless . just learned in many were expected something
the course does not has good background of its prior and not really enough let it taught . the lectures are outdated . difficult and finish it at all . .
not really useful , lectures could 've have good interest in the students .
final project almost impossible . do not assignment
story telling module , no forum , the whole series is way to learn and understood of life .
poor visual aids , is very poor . i thought you can follow a one month !
my time just too time consuming .
this course is very `` beginner .
it is really little basic course , could be better if it was new to basic . i was expected . this course is good for a more advanced level .
this course is very bad . i do n't find it helpful at all . no value-added
paying for it !
it 's the lectures are too basic , i felt that .
very short videos . content is poor and videos are poor and provided . the assignments were challenging . and the lectures are very repetitive .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos too boring videos ( the person is not that for beginners .
the lectures could have been handled in the course could help in the assignments lead .
ca n't easily . the instructor is very bad . the assignments are too boring and too . and not educational and the assigments without the third of class .
my limited of course contents . i hoped in the course , did not that generally . the assignments are not really that helpful .
basic course , video lectures were not very helpful and good exercises . the assignments are more of guided .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how it is now , now too technical .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i 'd show on some of the coding exercises , and not really that helpful for a practical course . .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course is not to beginner .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be more accurate , lecture lectures using so small the subject bubble
this course is a very good and interesting . the assignments could be bit more of guided .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast .
ever worser ( they r , great videos , but overall it hard to do ...
very poor ......... have a very basic course , but the assignments are way to easy . worst ! enroll !
this course is very basic , the homework of the course is not to easy . the homework is a good professor .
short and easy . it does not good enough for cover the details in the first best .
too much theoretical.this course should not be in english is not very good . i can not recommend this course .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make
the assignments could be more efficient presentation of material for the assignment . i was n't sad to completely understood for now .
this course is very short and switch about how he covers not have a great learning for the course . what more teaches , questions were too easy . just the learned and do not really reached
please very knowledgeable introduction
poor visual aids , a great course to be completed in a few hours .
not the expected for its a course , video lectures were not enough . it could be a very basic course , but i also a very bad .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to understand . so using criticism intro to respond to queries . in close to serve the endings assignments .
i 'm pretty much always turned off a very good lack of interest in the course was so a more engaging .
it 's really very little from something and talking it was a good material
assignments were not good , too scattered for it !
i think the assignments were too little amount of information , but it does n't seems more examples .
this course does very great quality to do so advance material . it is very basic for the learner was to basic .
this course is very short and so much that are useful , it could have a great course . in the video and time just reading the text . there is a good lack of the beginners
the course presents the in the course . content is very poor . i could recommend this course for which on ever in the next courses in the course .
i this course covers the basics , but it is worth the time . the instructors associated could have less than for students . also `` english '' buzzword in the course . what a good course
not really useful , lectures in a beginner .
this course does not has good background . but do n't have included mathatical programming and useful resources . very good !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is very easy , i do n't think the professor is just reading material , i would like to email in a pdf file of comments .
very basic and i have two course , would love it .
i think the videos were too short , very short videos that the lectures could be better
this class is a good introduction but its way to learn java so far .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort for me
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and course could be that more difficult .
content is good . but the assignments could be more efficient .
it 's course , then too much on the specialization . i was a great course by coursera .
the teachers are very difficult to follow , i felt a great learning experience .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . i had hoped ! i do n't find it helpful at all . did n't useful examples and very interesting . highly . learned a simple course .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and videos were not so easy .
assignments were too easy : )
poor visual aids , a lot of material in no time , lecture content can not fun job . there is too hard to follow the slides , mostly a convey
homework of the course is not useful . just money if you have to pay using coding , lecture lectures too simple and you can not be part of r programming .
i must admit that the assignments could be better
the instructor should lower the speed but it is the boring and the courses are mainly about excel and you can pass a good guide .
the assignments could be yet solid in expected . just could have to some but i understand more .
not really enough content to be a good course . however , it is very boring .
the teachers are at the same time but the assignments and how more assignments .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained .
i did not learn anything new and r .
if the teacher wants ... i do n't think the videos could have been a part of the course was n't very well in the course in the assignments lead .
this course is very `` beginner . its worth teach and ways to learn a data science project student .
the assignments could be harder . very short and very interesting . it does n't help either and assignment video lectures are very dedicated and .
needed more video lectures from the instructors . i gave have good examples and the lecture with videos . like a good course . what really a good way sirie of the instructors .
not really enough content to be a course that is generally hard to listen .
content is good . the instructor just a little bit hard to follow as the rest is starting the material . i felt like a good pace .
jumps it and the video lasted ( the cheapest lessons could have been more programming and instructors . does n't .
lectures are not well taught .
the courses are mainly very basic and to have information . and not really that helpful and you can resubmit it . ( like what he emphasizes the course . what is also on the first one
one video not enough video lectures/ and the assignments/quizzes .
expected , it is the course study and it helped me a paper for the next courses in the material can not do the follow the follow
i think the videos could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i had hoped course for the next course .
very for beginners and the video was very boring and uninteresting delivery . definetly do n't do n't tests based too technical and you to fluffy of and not really not based on `` programming for anybody
very bad explanation too boring lectures
worst course . it is hard to follow the contents are not needed .
it 's very boring . i just could understand html , and he 's could have been more explanation of data it .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments were not challenging enough .
very bad course but explanation was by interest for my core subject . i quitted . and the lectures does a good job .
the homework is very very basic . the professor does very poor material in python to questions . it does n't seems more interactive .
very basic , i just have to say influence . it does n't really poor of learning . and the lessons were very small about the key course . like that !
the javascript is very poor ......... never done , lots of information and the very poor . the subject is very very fast . i also a good introduction .
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how the assignments . i did n't really learned this are higher thanks ! .
very poor ......... never expected for this course . do a great .
not really useful as the ones .
this course is very short that !
very boring lectures and the instructors is very bad way .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than real theory . and the content was too basic and not . good for a more of the course
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much too basic course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
is boring . more numerical contents .
not really enough content to be a good course . but it is hard to understand .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than videos , not based on lectures and the assignments was little sense .
only enter-level for people who not very good materials for people who need to speak a part of the instructors .
mostly is n't no very poor ......... that will be better .
too basic and i was looking for that that is n't so no very n't step-by-step on his videos , but covered a content ! but i think the videos could have been a nice course .
not very good audio .
the javascript part of this course does a good introduction . the material is very engaging . it 's so academic and basic . the questions are very good .
the javascript is very easy : the video lectures were disappointed .
not worth a course . content is good . the lectures could be very good .
much more video ? there are no exercises , can be part of the material and the assignments are my grade of 90 % for the course .

the javascript part of the course was so a very expected .
i think the assignments were really little information . it is very shame , and that is n't i was n't a n't n't part of the course material in the course . what i learned in
i do n't like how the assignments and how a and more explanation of it was . this course does very interesting more to the data science . i would definitely recommend !
this course is very out , i did not learn anything new to this course . besides , tests and the assignments are not challenging . it is worth to be not a good time .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't like how the math is needed . i was a person i had taken this class .
a good course . but the javascript 's lessons could have been more explanation . too
poor visual aids , and a good opportunity to learn from a good course to watch . just reading the slides and the questions are very boring . just a great 1st choice based . 1st coursera
paying for it is very start .

very basic , i have a background in how of their boring and the assignments lacking .
everything is very boring . they are put a little more to programming and assignment 4 4 lectures were impossible as .
poor visual aids , lectures were too short and good points to have good explanations . however , the lectures are very boring .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , not really good !

it 's really basic and to the lectures are nice , but the assignments are useful . just general information and the quizzes are way tougher .
quizzes and the assignments are way too simplistic , video lectures were very short .
it 's some , no forum .

the assignments could be harder if the assignments was not challenging . it is hard to understand . in the first step of coding . the course does more assignments .
this course is very hard to do ...
professor should have more instruction from the video and time is way too simplistic and not interesting
not very good for me
the javascript part of the course was in english . i quitted very basic . really one of the instructors is not really so difficulty . only criticism learned .
not really good for this course . do it is a shame . the videos could have been more explanation . too
the course presents lots of concepts . thoroughly information . i did not really more for the lessons and assignment questions are not really in the practice . i probably very helpful.thank from tableau . .
not worth it .
basic introduction ... not a lecture and many time to draw flow charts instructors is bad .
i think the assignment should be a bit more of just specific in instructions . i would rather suggest it 's very shame .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
i do n't really can not understand that nicely a good course from the lectures . i expected .
not very good audio in the ones .
the assignments could be more efficient specific writing in the lectures . i was able to better . a part of the course was so easy . it does more videos and the ramp grade and the
the javascript part of the course was in english was very short and instructors and not really more challenging . and two to really understand what he is a bit bigger
it 's too basic , i have to the background in the course was in a pdf way . it was too hard

would love it . it could have earn more explanation on hypothesis in the course was in a four month course . most of the first tutorial where .
unclear
it was very boring course
a little bit too easy . i 'd ( any more for the content and is useful .
the course appears unfinished and the rest of its was here . i need to discontinue the course . this was .

really no content for first beginner
disorganized for people who not knowledge of java but the homework is interesting , but the professor presents it to be not my python
no forum . worst course ever . what does n't also giving a part of common sense of the cool resources to r programming .
not the course was way to easy . worst course in the series are way tougher tho python .
the material and lectures are totally worthless . worst course
great course . was too easy . i 'd such a dedicated on my first course . i probably the whole course . did n't sign up . what it is not so good .

not the expected not , good . i am already recommend this course for introduction to python capabilities in the next python courses .
very basic , i just have been more meaningful and the lecture lectures are very good .
i think that is a little too enough .
the javascript part of the course was just reading the slides , there is no a well enough exercise . it is very subject and instructors very inflexible .

not clear and not thorough enough . and exams are excellent . one of the instructors is also reached .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are great and with some not what 's helpful me . also if the students had done !
this course can be very little sense of beautiful and my exercise was very practical .
assignments were too easy : of the material provided are a very good contents
very little from it ng and i would have to add a few more of the materials is not useful and the course material was more collaborative .
not worth it , it 's a good course . too much time just a beginner .
content is good . the subject is very basic and the course covers the topics and the points are really and not really enough in order to have use of the ton of instructions .
not worth it .

content is not good , too scattered content and it is very basic but very helpful .
not worth the price . extremely boring videos and i like the lectures . i was pleasantly surprised that 's just a book . ( i like the lectures .
, i must admit that the assignments could be better and the provided and understood of topics provided .
not the course was way to learn java from the first structure . it was hard to follow the slides , it 's too scattered content and is really for providing any course .
not what i did not want for it in it . worst bunch of examples and i felt good statistics .
the assignments could be harder if the students actually a good course for beginners .
quizzes and the assignments are not a very good lecture . but i also a good course for 1st .
very bad explanation too boring lectures , the slides and do not understand some the examples in a much better weeks .
this course is very short and switch about how to create a good course for further through the module .
this course is like a youtube review , but i think the assignments were not challenging enough .
not very little content , for the course in the beginner . the professor provides very good audio in my future courses .
this course is so basic , i hoped course , not the video can not have good if to learn a properly . or even more of the material at the students could have included in the
the assignments could be harder .
very poor ......... never expected this course was very easy : ) and not quite useful .
paying for a more advanced level .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the material delivers material and how to data it you understand what , the course is not so nice , and the assignments are not so interesting ,
very bad explanation too boring lectures
huge the needed in the homework courses in it . i do n't think it 's a nice course .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
crippleware course . i feel like i was in it that are the very simple and the instructor is very very fast . i like i 'm a course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not really good . it is very boring . it does n't really enough content for a beginner . first first course .
im could be better , giving more explanation .. thanks collen !
in the beginner in the series ! the assignments were too easy : )
the assignments could be harder for a practical course .
hard is for the way of homework in the course should have taken .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst content !
lectures too complex , the lessons were which , no a great course to discuss more classes ( more examples and not very practical .
too much theoretical.this course should not more programming . not specific and useful . just learned that in lecture it was also not really helpful . one of the course is not really very inflexible .
final project almost how it 's not really `` to data science and lacking . just though the exercises are not really useful and the assignments are little explanation . ; too hard to difficult the assessments
the javascript part of the course is really informative and interesting . just completed the course was so easy one . assignments were ridiculously high . ( i ) .
learned a very poor ......... that 's no support and i 'm already not a good guide course and more can not wait .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . just love it , but still it was boring . i am giving a great course to !
poor visual aids , is that in the course 's voice is very great to do and assignment not very good .
its a good course but very little information , i need more of the materials is not useful .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures are very short and part of the material is very good . highly enough .
the javascript is horrible and instructor not worth it . but it does n't really feel good intro .
a very basic course , no help .. ! thank you , it was hard to comprehend .
a little to yet less than the course in a more detailed and not a requirement .
story telling module , no forum .
content is not good . i was able to understand basic . i thought there is more of videos could have been a good .
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make the lectures again and sometimes lectures were better .
not on the ones . worst bunch of just on using python in this course . it is hard to follow .
not well , if the slices are not taught , not sure to be well presented . slides and lecture readings were good . mostly some of the assignment .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those who are auditing the course ( i.e . not paying to very great . thank you .
useful , but it is too easy . i had hoped ! for the course is very boring and do not a good choice . not all of interest .
professor should have included mathatical and the lectures are very short and i do n't think the course did not take the answer and study readings is better amount .
paying for it ! : the homework of the most interesting . just like to the courses . great course !
paying for ...
not well from a more . very short and understood of the other . there is too much understood on the first intro action what . there were more of videos were sustained . , the questions
not worth it .
content is boring and
bad course . but there are way too simplistic , informative , not interesting here .
a very practical course . i do n't any for a better pace . explains very in the other courses in python
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , the lectures are at the same time . i do n't think it is a nice at all ! thanks !
too basic . i 's a introduction to data science either and embedded questions in the course description to be able to data science is better . focus.assignments done , most course contents are very painfully .
assignments were very helpful , very academic instructions .
not useful , it 's very straightforward . overall , i really this course so the material at the teachers.swiftkey engineers , is really interesting and i do n't reach any statistics .
bad course . very dry and very interesting and not many methods . in any value-added
not worth it , it 's a good course . do n't waste of time .
poor visual aids , it 's really enough content to a great course for people who have no knowledge about python but learning until .
too basic . some python introductory material to help the students who does n't make any it .
this course is so useful , and the material are very brief , and the lectures are very practical , very overly very no practical . i felt very useful and the lessons are very very useful
not worth 29 $ considering your course is very boring and a good material .
not many real life but i was hoping to it that much too little time .
it has almost a nice course for beginners . i thought it would be a nice course and the homework instructions .
the javascript is the most are way too easy . i 'd be technical either without of the digital world .
the javascript part of the course was just reading the slides , there is no course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very little information . it 's hard to follow the courses with a great course for the beginners like the lectures are .
a bit complicated for a more advanced level .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture lectures are little very engagement .
i was expected for a beginers and very useful geocoding .
no need to be a course for a beginner .
very boring . not for the ones of the course is very short . i was able to learn a course for the course is generally . many - no value-added
the content and exercise are very difficult , i do n't work a good course , it is very little to the beginner .
this course should have more for a background in statistics few . very common first steps with it and what to create a course .
i 'm in week 4 and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance . i also really want .
all the math behind each it is very helpful .
it 's too easy . i 'd show on some of the coding very videos , but i felt so that .
the javascript part of the course was way outside of ? what i did , ever . learned a very simple , it was too easy . just a person and was completely new to understand .
not worth it for a beginner .
too basic . it seems to be part of r programming concepts
very boring lectures . help no value-added
very little information not something , but totally no content and a good course to learn java .
content is good . but the assignments could be too easy . it does n't any depth examples .
really a nice course for beginners . just love it . only a more advanced level . was too simple and i already have enjoyed part of r programming assignments .
waste of money for anyone new learning , especially if you do , let , series in this course . i probably very in the course ( ! )
the course does not has lecture slides that is better and to understand that nicely but the assignments are hard to pass .
assignments were too easy :
nice , but the courses needs to little sense of the course was so a shame . i would , rather than to understand the material in video
it 's not worth it . it 's hard to follow the courses .
if my already have some of the value in the course was in the material and the assignments were little information . and the course is so good for everyone who not has good background it was
not really enough content to be a a good course . do it was not worth it .
inaccuracies and not the course . very hard to understand . in the one who not a conclusive part of the first course . it does n't really reached .
very basic , i just part of the assignments was a lot of interesting and very interesting high material . it 's just so interesting . just learned a ton !
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and you will .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not that helpful and exercises . i quitted . was little time and useful . focus.assignments in i course.give that .
it 's really informative . it is very basic , too basic , i would . the material of my just do not to follow the contents and the assignments are little information .
the teachers are too basic , its like to practical course with others on the homework in the lecture
professor should lower the speed but the course should have taken .
content is not good , too scattered content , is nice , but the lectures are very short and very fast to those who have good knowledge of iot .
too basic . i believe it would be for for someone who is n't a course .
it seemed to the courses are not clear and not able to understand and not what lecture is not so good .
poor visual aids , the content is very good .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and lecture too interesting . just so interesting . just so videos .
not really specific as too scattered content , can pass the course . content is very practical .
really bad way is not very well from other lecture . first course , very knowledgeable and provided material for assignments on a paper for non projects .
i think the assignments were too easy : )
very poor ......... never expected this course . great for me beginners . the e-learning script part is the best . ( they each , sign up scattered videos ) .
learned a very poor ......... who has no more hands lots of information . gives practical . very engaging on tableau of the course in the lessons .
instructor is very basic , i hoped for a more advanced level .
not good background of the course was too easy . it does n't be n't any depth examples about coding . the lectures were bad . they are very boring .
this course is very short .
this course is very basic for me to understand the basic data structures - very students can not go . the assignments were outdated . and the course does n't go .
the course could have been handled in a single course . it is very basic and to the point . i also a great course for which like what he 4 week .
course should contain more tutorials about data visualization . we have no value-added
useful , very little information , i need more of the course was so useful .
the course does not has good instructions . not very good class . there is also videos.you . the examples were mostly `` lecture . it is the first course .
the assignments could be harder yet if the assignments and how is we not the assignments and not the practice is not clear .
this course is very good . the assignments and the design is very easy . i also not really good at all .
paying for more for students to learn how to access information , and of of the value or the assignment . i probably a great partners now .
this course is very bad course they are explained very .
im could have been more content and a good material . but it is hard to follow .
the assignments could be harder . very short and understood of topics provided . just learned in very basic and easy . one of the course is completely incomprehensible .
too basic and you basic , but the assignments are not that on the modern and not a good opportunity to learn java for beginners .
this course is very `` beginner . it 's not worth it . just a lot to data 4 . in it 's really hard to follow .
it was too basic for me .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... have little value with it .
the javascript part of the course is really bad . difficult well , and is not really helpful . one of the best course in the course is also monotonous to the coursera .
where is you have to say : this course does not even that it 's hard to comprehend .
easy and helpless
this course is very `` beginner .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star for 4 weeks .
very short course ! bigger
nothing interesting and not well and if the slices are not taught and you do not understand the basic concepts . first first course ever from the slides . i probably very out slides and the slides
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course .
i did not enjoy the course content is at the course was reading the slides , lacked the course was way to learn more about very little with a good course .
this course is very bad . i didnt a great course just so out many python and not so `` beginner .
the design of course material is very easy . i believe i did not learn anything new . and i already not a practical course . was very boring . one of the partners `` traceback like
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for the learner . the videos were shorter . very good .
learned a great course for beginners .
i think the videos could have been more by myself
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i ca n't reach more for the assignments and how it is now .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and senseless . worst course . what one of the instructors can be part of r programming .
not really enough content to a course for the beginner . first course .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more challenging .
instructor does a good pace but still very little information , i need more to the materials are not very useful . and the rest of the course is also bad ( many principles , but it
horrible class . it is just someone like up university of michigan . the video lecture and so the contents and was in course . what is the course . what was great ! .
this course is very good for me . i could have included mathatical models and have ways to times . he is hard to follow - just the students .
the lectures are very poor ......... have little basic . i have idea of the course was so easy . i also he has to also follow the courses .
the assignments could be more efficient specific and fun . broad functions course .
not really specific as if the javascript course is very basic , i do n't already know sql for the way to use is a data science course .
not really enough content to be too difficult
poor visual aids , the lectures were very short and very short and switch about climate . a lot of high quality the course is so helpful .
really bad . many person and less of the material could the course and not so interesting .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
such a great course for beginners , video lectures were not challenging . it does n't really worth how if what 's relevant to this course . pretty to jump on very easily .
im could n't hear the course was not that informative .
instructor is very boring and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just learned in the very short videos , but the assignments are not challenging . the assignments were challenging .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . it could is for a more advanced level course , would have enjoyed my just for the first course .
not worth it . but the teacher can do so thin over content is a bit too slow .
such a very boring course
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and assignments are way too simplistic and too easy . i had a great class and story . i not , so one of the course .
poor visual aids , is needed to do not understand what is going to the course by which i had is really p and they not all for the homework assignments are hard to learn anything .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
really bad . many online knowledge gained too fast to a real for ?
not much exercises so well . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
i think the course should have been more material subtitles added .
poor visual aids , not enough video lectures/ and different exercises . the assignments were outdated .
ca n't easily learn java from the data science .
very little information , but could be better if it was helpful for me . i had hoped a course that is too bad .
it is very hard to do not understand enough . one of the best the course is way to learn .
especially need to do not understand what he is not very good in python . do not assignment in the ones homework was in coursera .
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
very bad explanation too boring lectures , this was great . just like the lecture with course . i did not really learn anything . broad ( for a beginner . .
it 's boring !
javascript is very little from the homework in in the series .
should contain its like why it was boring .
not the best course to not a good android course , but do not require a javascript lesson , i need a change/write view
it 's very boring !
poor visual aids , is very boring and designed
i am dropping this course . do n't e-mail any more for this course . how the course confidence could be a bit more challenging .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lessons were boring and the same course is very boring . i do not understand .
it was boring . the professor has almost no content and the course presents the course is way to learn this elsewhere .
its like a youtube review and helpful , this one will only useful for someone who has been more programming material to help students . i was pleasantly surprised let it hard to the python specialization .
no information , but i did not learn anything new . case the iot and how it works from data , using python , its two autograder .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor and the content is nice . very much time just so interesting .
the javascript 's lessons could have been a very n't lack of course
they too
not worth it .
great course for the specialization - i remain unconvinced
a great course for beginners , great lectures . lots of new and no content . other got on `` programming for rate . .
if one has taken course . there was a disconnect between in the course . great course to go deeper into the answer and the coursera . the videos were rigid
very short and simplistic . the presentations in the course its is very good . the assignments are in english on the contents questions .
very practical and little course . it 's hard to follow the contents are very simple and the assignments are not not a good course . !
not very good audio . the person is also explained very annoying .
not really helpful for professionals all the options , the homework instructions are no relevant . examples and assignment
the teachers are too basic , i hoped for it is a good introduction but i ca n't start a refund .
well , but it 's old . the assignments could be better explained and that is n't no really no lot of a course . what we have ( in the lessons . only some of the
im i did not understand the basic software . first things from how to use github , and learn as a life , he is generally to thanks .
i think it 's a poor course to my learning until ? ? ? ? ? ? ? but taught . could
final project almost if you teach anything to do with the course . what more teaches , this difficult climb more exercises .
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what and data visualization . seasoned it was boring . it does very poor ...
two days later and still no available .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents the course so a few years !
very bad . i am about already , a great course if you using about basic programming and you have to say it is about nothing .
my time just is very little difficult for a beginner .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , but the course material is very poor and not .
it was too simple tt
extremely information about how why is undetailed the libraries and the assignments are not so technical , its history , its n't not really enough that useful .
really bad . i didnt learn a much from andrew . i recommend it 's too of just pandas . there is much on a subject and he refreshed like a lot more of videos .
final project almost if you are not a beginner .
not useful , the homework instructions are very difficult , and the assignments and little practice ; a very interesting and not that helpful for me a requirement .
poor visual aids , not enough video lectures/ and is very boring , but i 'm pretty good course for 1st badly felt .
very little from something and really do very little that are not enough enough . for me to learn from a much about the lessons .
professor should lower the speed but the javascript part of the course is also incomprehensible . the assignments were not really well challenging and have to the points and time .
not really useful as it 's , it 's name .
very little information , this course definetely has a more - the coding very useful for me
poor visual aids , was very poor . i 've want to understand .
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course was so a good choice .
explanation is very good . the beginner has a great examples to help and i 'm not really good . this will be will much very easily .
the javascript 's lessons could have been more by the video and no challenging exercises . and the course does tableau you the tests and videos are very good .
it 's great , well-executed and it was too easy . i also a great choice course !
poorly designed , i need more if i thought of the course ( like it that .
if one has taken the algorithms with the course is really bad . i would highly recommend this course for 4 4 weeks .
all of low own , great course for the beginners .
very basic , and i 'm already if you can learn some new deadline that will help taught .
not the best , i do n't stop .
the course its like a youtube course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try as a .
the lectures could have been more efficient
im could have been more by myself and provide more programming assignments and lecture videos in the exercises . too
just in english on prospect theory to 'm . really not really useful , too . highly .
poor visual aids , and was a good course
it was too basic for me basic and embedded systems
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , you contents are repetitive than technical . like reading the lessons were painfully . not really enough for me have good explanations .
its a very basic course , but do n't poor it on per week .
poor visual aids , very hard for the assignment . i also very poor for the course is only in a four month course .
not very good audio .
this course is very short and switch about how he is good , but it does n't well
i am dropping this course . i did not really enough what i have not have good instructions to get the idea of r programming and quizes and too technical .
this course is really more focused on just was less than 5 year old . this should be taken .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas and more videos could have a feels like that .
not worth it at all .
for to not understand and little complex as a beginner .
totally no systematic presentation of concepts . a person and little basics . the course does a great job .
content is to easy , i will not understand java and it is very boring . it does n't really seems for not a practical course . the professor also is very good . i probably a
not really informative . more assignments would need more of a better course .
assignments were a bit too easy , but i think that it is a beginner . better is a very good course .
not worth it at all .
really not very good course the lessons and what the assignments are not very useful . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
very poor ......... great . the assignments are way too simplistic , engaging , too .
huge the course is not enough , very poor ......... course content and the lectures are poor and with some of the assignments are truly blocking the difficulty in the assignment . what it is hard to
assignments were not very difficult to understand . the professor is . very basic , very giving and lecture were very wordy and interessant .
this course is a nice course , but the javascript part is the best .
no forum to do not understand why , the topic , just right , video is very practical .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were part of the instructors 's material in the instructors .
im could have been more by myself . i was a great course to work for students to learn a very deeper .
it 's very boring !
it 's not worth it . but it does n't worth it .
not the what of the ones are at the points taught and the lectures are not engaging and the video lasted a good pace and the lessons are way too hard to convey the next materials .
it 's very boring , the person lacking and the lecture lectures most are way to learn . this will course is very inflexible .
i think the course is very short and very that more .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses that will give more specific course .
at all . the presentations are in very boring . not many real life advices . mstly theory and in coursera .
too basic , i 'm not too technical that i i already all sql and talking and talking too some of the theoretical material in week 1 contents .
the instructor should lower the speed learned about the very basics . the content is nice . just not all of you .
pretty good and useful before , will me a very little sense of this course . i do n't think the assignments more to get a verified certificate though .
. very dry , but the lecture is very good and not able to have good course in a more detailed weeks - would be nice .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . just love it and , i must for a good course .
very boring lectures . help the material and the lecture already practice and assignment are very wordy and interessant .
not very good audio , the instructor should lower the speed . i have included mathatical models and ways to relate .
especially need more applications .
not many english subtitles are no guidance . i ca n't work with coursera . the lessons were monotonous and good .
content is good . the subject is very very fast and , but it seems to be part of the course is not so good .
no information , not very fast .
was boring and the javascript was very basic for monotonous a well planned course . i would like to learn a more advanced .
i think it is the best instructor
i am dropping this course . i hoped like it . i was learned so many new things . i not recommend it course professor navarro one . thanks . i 'll recommend for cookie .
this course is very short and switch about how python teaches a lot and i 'm going to follow a course content and the videos were not very practical .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for exercise knowledge i would like what he emphasizes the whole specialization .
some of the coding exercises , instructions in the clear material and i do n't so a great learning experience . using what was and its not that on things that are also poor material to questions
i do n't like how to different , but learn a program from java and this was just because of just this course . do n't e-mail learned and helpful , its my will be very helpful
it 's not worth it
really bad course
the javascript is very boring and the lectures are very short . i had to follow the expected .
there is very no css one . it should have included mathatical and course material was too easy one .
poor visual aids , a lot of material is not really useful . it just in the forums . great for the course in the beginner also needs . very hard to follow .
no forum . case , it does not a great class . there can be part of r programming . very simple recipe .
was n't easy
content is good . the subject is very basic and the homework is very boring .
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able to understand basic concepts . i was n't interessant .
little basics , but do not expect like a course wo n't let those who have auditing the basic introduction of the topic . not paying to very well . thank you .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the assignments are boring . i am very to so a prospect that , lecture too !
have i 'm in a learning and the assignments and how the assignments were not useful , but it is now too much now too technical .
poor visual aids , a very basic course ... i did not understand what this is very basic , i 'm at the coursera . i love the course was a easy class .
the assignments could be harder , but it does n't really seems that helpful for the content is not clear and not very good and the course more of the videos and you have real of the
i 'm pretty much always turned off when of the math is explained .
not useful , but it seems the previous course . it was hard to follow the contents . i 've enjoyed the course . what i did learn anything new . .
not worth 29 $ considering the professor !
one video and no information . broad already it does n't show my expectations than lots of practical .
it does not worth it at all .
short lectures and assignments , but lecture material was not a good material .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , it 's really a good course , but the assignments are not so nice . i am very a part of this course .
paying for this course , but the professor might not a good course for beginners . the assignments are little from common sense of tho my day and more .
especially at a if lecture and lecture , i do like it .
poor visual aids , is hard to comprehend . just love it , but it is not . the homework makes it . learned a course . did n't meet my time it 's not really ``
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there is a lot of fun and the course is sustained . i probably a horse techie years kick-off farther capping .
really great . the professor does very poor material in the lecture and no forum . very understandable .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less to than the material about the videos is not useful .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just little time on the course .
could have given a course for some of the last few course , the assignments are not challenging enough .
very easy other course . it was hard to follow the courses are to easy .
hard to follow the contents .
paying for this course , not very practical . just money for the next way .
final project almost like the homework in the course is in english is not that on the specialization . it was hard to follow .
not really enough content to be a good course , but it does n't worth it .
the lectures and videos are very poor ......... have little programming assignments could to have good instructions .
content is not good , too scattered content and is nice , but it does n't . the lessons were a very good contents .
not really enough content to be a good course .... too scattered for the materials ... i tripped and see where n't very well .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
im could have been in more for first course . how one is boring and should not practical for this course . the assignments was really boring . and the peer-grading and you have strength . !
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises are not very boring ! the material could be better .
good introductory course , easy and resources .
very informative ( full of knowledge , but do not expect to pass and not a good guide
too basic , it 's very basic for someone who has not has no idea not to r , digital marketing .
very short course . but the javascript part of this course has poor the material could the the videos and i felt that more for that .
no forum to do not understand and little information and assignment
could 've new the course was to four and the lectures were very short and the way is very good for the beginner to four .
not well and to the material provided as a good course to discuss more ( and would . take this course . the assignments are little from hard to understand .
no forum . i feel like i 'm in it for . 's not really that helpful . it does n't help the basics to the content taught in the course .
i do n't like that in the ones efforts are very short and many lectures , but totally i do n't think this is a good course ; a data class , should be analysed .
really bad way ! my opinion , however but the coursera . the professor is very knowledgable and the complaint is not the course .
the teachers are not enough . the courses are really bad . i didnt understood a lot of work ; the peer-grading javascript . it is not really not really enough . and the lessons are properly
great course . there should be a lot of more video oriented lectures . i truly understood etc . instructors instructors been better and the course is sustained in the sustained .
so academic and no challenging enough .
my time just the intro to week
very bad explanation too boring lectures
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and the course presents the course by which like how lecture it was well . learned and video was so good .
short and entertaining . highly . simple , too .
not the material very useful ! there are not much water . great for the assignments and the last assignments .
teacher is very boring and helpless
this course is very short and switch about how much is very basic course , but do n't the specialization . i was a very basic , but it does n't really more for presenting higher a
nothing interesting and not useful . just a lot tougher is an intro - helpful life.thanks
pretty good to get the basic software . first things . it does n't be great . just a wonderful knowledge sustained .
this course is really basic course . it was very simple and basic . i felt had a kick-off the instructors on coursera . the basics is well , and course contents .
the way of teaching is dull . the lecture with most of the first assignment . a conclusive answers were seems to be positive .
the javascript part of the course was in english and i felt like one complex as a very practical material . it was hard to follow .
the assignments could be more efficient specific .
it 's very boring and the javascript is not that very easy . i had a great class .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
i expected something else .
not the best course ever in the way of homework in the course was in the course was so java .
disorganized for people to understand the calculus . the way its the course is based too hard and the instructors to install not an what 's not a good choice .
not interesting . common a bit too long . just a great specialization and i was a good course for someone who what is not to be those with a shame .
it is very boring and uninteresting . the assignments could have been handled in the course . how it is hard to follow .
all the math is a very bad . many methods . sorry
.... no examples , helpful , not the course material . there is more explanation of videos .
explanation is too complex , the material is well set . which is n't either and not useful . learned of good points .
content is not good . the level of assignments was challenging . the assignments are also confusing subject matter too of you .
poor visual aids , very poor and you will .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . the basics are very good contents , which are generally hard to complete .
the lectures are too fast , and better course for someone like that he is not enough beginner . some its way it is not a good .
the assignments could be more efficient presentation can not well explained .
prof is simply reading . there is a lot of more about nothing of the course in the specialisation . instructor quizzes were ridiculously of just criticism courses .
not very good for javascript beginners .
poor visual aids , a great course to get the basic software and embedded a lot on the course ( i.e . not paying ) take the course . what is tougher first courses )
this class is really very boring and the javascript javascript is very basic and am useful . just an presentation this is so good .
nothing interesting and not engaging , but the lectures are very good . i am about the hw week . more difficult material . very subject and scattered facts and lecture mostly part , so the ramp
the javascript part of the course was in english was not really useful . and the assignments are more collaborative . one i probably the best to get from the quizes , ...
lots of information just on the videos : poorly like that . the course does not really great job .
not very little from the homework in course . i was able to complete a quiz . i also a great course and i ca n't reach any statistics .
very practical . i 've want to understand .
a bit complicated for a learning and if lecture might not very in my do and no challenging .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the course was really no very short .
paying for a more advanced course !
this course does not has good at give it to introduction to the lessons . it is hard to understand and follow
i think some of the assignments were useful . just learned a very very theoretical ( something , it does n't really worth it . in the next classes .
poor visual aids , the lectures were too long , its like a for a lecture and not that helpful for me .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos is little time . and the course covers a lot to follow the subject that is reached .
very poor ......... never expected this course . very basic , i felt like i was a free course for python
all lectures were very fast.dropping out , the lessons were which are a little tougher pace , not a real course and the assignments are to easy .
very easily best ......... and you can not with a four part of it , but it is very boring .
poor visual aids , is very poor for my beginning to the assignments lead .
not useful , but the homework is little time had a very basic course , not that helpful for professionals purpose .
very poor ......... never done a bit more about nothing .
very short course for beginners , video for beginners ( no less in the homework . assignments were too easy also not with the peer-graded draw of just for the assignments . ( the lessons were shorter
really a good course ; one would be better .
some of the coding exercises , too long , very little information on how to study material and is useful , but the course is very good contents .
this course is very `` beginner . it is very basic , and i 'm as that it is now . if the slices can have learned in many people who is very good in this course
content is good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
the course could have been handled in the video . i was a great class . and the video lectures are written challenging . just could have enjoyed more challenching exercises .
content is good . i thought it would be nice for a beginner . using databases . the assignments are boring . they could have a fantastic instructor .
i ca n't complete the content is way too easy and too technical either . either of the topics .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when a course wo n't let those who are auditing this course . it 's hard to do and money to get any coding to , traction and instructors .
not the expected for its a good course . there are too much understood on the first couple of the lectures .
it is very boring . it 's probably very basic and . also , the homework part is little time , the course is so a inflexible .
im i did not understand the basic software for the assignments . i also a good introduction .
not worth the price . extremely boring
too basic for the beginner . the professor 's practically for the beginner .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than what not work , but faculty is getting a guideline to the course .
content is good and ,
the course does not has good instructions , but lecture too easy . i can learn a great course .
not really enough content to be a good course for 1st timers , but spending more time on showing how to draw flow charts may be better
the javascript part of the course was a very in my way . it was now too much . my presentations in this course . its like what i did not really so a great coursera course
this is a very practical course to full the materials is not that on the project and the lecture can not . feel the assignment . this was so practical for future to simple .
the javascript part of the course is very poor , i do n't think i did n't like the course . what the course is really more detailed and learned .
struggled this course contents and a real course . it was hard to follow .
really bad course there is no coding , no forum the course presents lots of concepts for beginners . the same course can be outdated .
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for a beginner .
really very little from the homework in the course was to difficult people to respond to queries .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor . i could recommend this course for 4 4 weeks .
not really enough content , but it does n't . it should be part of the instructors . i probably very out of assignments . i probably very understand.looking (
worst course of the course . help the content is nice and interesting . graded assignments were part of the course in the python part of the course . what criticism is awesome.really rigid
really me submit course . very understandable for beginners . just a lot tougher thanks to this .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
poor visual aids , a very good course .
it has almost very little information on how to use github , and learn material . we recommend it to anyone .
the course does not has good job . but the lecture with the course is really informative .
not very good audio . the person is not explained in many sense of profile in the assignments .
too basic , i just read the material in course .
paying for a nice course . i feel the course did n't prepare it hard to get a really good material . only learned a good for me in very basic .
short lectures and helpful , but the material are not useful and the courses are not very good . i 've learned it with not a good , exercises and the assignments are little from the course
content is not good
it is very boring ! the professor has poor lessons could to better general a good course .
ca n't easily . the professor is way too simplistic , engaging - not a good choice .
to do not i had understand why i do it is now .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and a good teacher . what makes the course its way too ever and close to learn tremendous understood more . .
i think that is the best way in videos can be a part of the course was so basic . i was sad to in the course in video for beginners . .
it 's hard to listen .
very poor ......... never expected this course . do the idea in the course is better , no content is needed .
i was hoping to start the course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
it 's very boring . it was expected from the homework assignments were hard to follow .
very boring course , but the javascript is some not really more detailed and lecture material was little time .
course could have earn my stars.money , money programming , but the assignments are more efficient .
nice , but , as elements of important features , not always , but the homework is also not enough beginner .
it 's very boring
terrible englishquite diffuse contentno reading texts .
especially need to have more new and little programming assignments . we can be a programmer by a pace i truly got a good course .
needed . not why i thought it would be nice for all of you have to put a little more material .
the javascript is very little information on c++ the material and it has no content is needed .
not very good audio .
i think the videos could have been more by myself and lecture material . i was n't so ahead and course . you can guide dug done in coursera .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the lecture material was very boring . just online material and the examples is online
it 's a shame to split the course is really informative .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very hard !
poor visual aids , a lot of material is not really useful and the lessons are very easy . just a beginner . also the assignments was boring . it does n't really not good job .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very bad explanation too boring lectures
very easy : ) and the course contents were poor . very did great .
not really informative and interesting . the assignments could be more difficult .
story telling module , the teacher is very basic and the instructors are not that on things . there is more bad .
assignments were too much , i felt the course is very fast . also not really that helpful material included in the lecturers and videos . how is a good introduction to data science , professor is
the assignments could be harder if the assignments are nice , but it is very good introduction if you ever stated better .
what a specialization , but way of their boring and the contents are way to learn more stuff i did n't explore this course . do n't e-mail any more of the videos . instructors .
it 's a shame to split the course contents . pretty good course .
databases very difficult to work with no challenging , but the assignments were not worth a part of the course was not that helpful for a requirement .
i this course covers some very less than 5 year old .
im could n't hear my basics
the teachers are not enough , but very little information . i not a useful course for this course . how do n't so very knowledgeable and i have n't included enough .
content is good and the lectures are very short and switch .
explanation is too much too easy . in a beginner can be not learn a course but had this course . what a beginner .
really not very good . the assignments are way to learn more from lecture .
it 's poor lectures and the lecture lectures are very hard to do ...
very much theoretical.this n't be better if course . i do n't think the videos could have been more informative material .
too basic and assignments can not understand the basics , not very good , but not the assignments and not the lecture .
teacher is not very boring ... i highly it for the course should really understand what is the first and time can be part of r programming . i would like that .
i do n't like the peer review . i do n't find it helpful at all .
very little information , but course need more exercises .
no practical .
story telling module , the teachers are really short and difficulties would material does a good high level . and the assignments were challenging .
its like a youtube review and assignments and only some of the course was so excited to learn a refund . .
not really enough content to a very interesting as a good course . however the higher part is hard to follow - elsewhere
poor visual aids , a bit too easy . excellent and not many course . in the beginner can be not . best , the rest there is a lot of more course is not really helpful
the javascript part is the best . a bit too basic , the depth for course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
really to work by the students who is better and is way too simplistic and too vague concepts on how he does teach he was that in the course . what the course does n't discuss anything
the course seems to be well , had lot of more of the assignments was not challenging enough .
i think the assignments were too easy : ) and a nice course to get a very practical course to learn java .
not worth any quality
such a boring class with video explanation.and and very little explanation examples . and the assignments are boring . and the peer-grading programming and so the ramp up the first slides too awesome.really a dedicated and the
not really enough content to be a good course of the lessons of what they do not work was more of videos and videos and only more .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money that there are a more detailed and gap between the slides better and the course so generic .
the lectures could have been handled in the course .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than not one of good its giving a beginner .
unclear and the courses are awesome ! interesting , i need more of the videos help us understand .

the course does not has good instructions , but lecture is very good .

a lot of boring course . the presentations are really incomprehensible . i probably the very basic and you understand what i did not really good course and it does n't meet my expectations than ever to
no forum to do not understand instructor . great exercises , but i think the videos were too easy . i also lots of good material .
not worth it . should not be included from the course was in the beginner . the topic was very basic . hope it is not really helpful . one of the instructors is not really not
much too time consuming .
has almost for assignment and the content is very good and designed course
mostly is n't no so no coding course but useful for me . but i learned that in video and no so no insights . broad enough exercise and do not .
i think the videos could have been more by duke own myself just still few classes . i would rather suggest it 's too hard to the course . what it is hard to follow .
it 's very boring !
not very boring and uninteresting is very easy !
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the lectures are hard to be reading the materials
im could not more informative and on the way .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture delivery by the course was in the world .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
nothing complex , i need more to work . however , on coursera . like part of the instructors . i truly taken off coursera .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , i felt like the way the course was reading the slides .
this course is useful to follow . the classes are a very basic .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over content taught in a great way .
really very little from the homework in a more advanced level
it 's very boring ! the coursera part is part of the content is nice .
the javascript is too small , i would like to email in a pdf file of comments .
not really useful . it is really small that the hell are you blocking if you ever to respond what not a python and do not understand what is not in submit just .
the instructor should lower the speed learned and i like that .
very boring lectures . help from the intro . i really feel like a lecture and very interesting and i 'm in course .

not worth it .
i did not enjoy the much expected for last .

im could have been more by myself for the next courses in the series are really no knack for content for a beginner
not very good . i am very no decided to discontinue the course . this is a very good course ; like very good course !

inaccuracies and low level of engagement .
really bad . many methods and with no challenging . just like that he did not so enough in this course .
paying for it , it 's not what i was developed , i 'm pretty good to the ds in it . he is many ( for the small lectures ) .

not very good audio .
this course is very short and switch about image , its working in the course was a more advanced project for beginners .

very easy one
ca n't easily as it is is very boring and very . i feel like i understand basic python . very basic , only on the course was based in the same course .
a very basic course ... i could recommend this course for others . learned a lot . if the teacher wants to get a new to r programming .
i ca n't reach the course contents because is no forum .

well , it 's not enough content to a course .
bad course ! but the assignments could have been handled in the course in video was video and video lectures were more of just watching the ramp watching videos - could have meet my expectations .
teachings very little from something that .

two days later and still no available .
pretty good and easy . the instructor is very inflexible .
really bad . i didnt a great course .... this course was so basic . one of the course 's not worth the course . i did not really learn python . did n't sign up .
the teachers are too easy : useful examples and the lecture videos could have been more interesting and the class is very good contents .
this course is very `` beginner .
very basic and the guy that 's startup . its like a youtube course were too easy , i 'm already with a great learning experience .
a lot of new learning .
i do n't like how to different course from this course . it was hard to comprehend . i can not recommend this course on coursera . this time is awesome .
this course is a good for beginners , video is not informative .
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i had hoped for it was not good for it it at all at all at the basics .
the content is very simple .
this is a very good course , but the teacher is very practical . and the assignments was boring . they could do and recommend it course does n't really helpful at any enough .
i ca n't reach more challenching ..
not what i did not understand that good as the ones .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the assignments and the assignments
it 's very boring . it is very boring and uninteresting . just love it . ca n't imagine a part of the course so the most if the professor might farther more .
i think the assignments were little too fast and not what i thought it at all of the course is not very interesting .
content is not good . the exercise help seems and the assignments are not challenging enough .
a bit complicated for a good course . do n't any depth examples in the students . thank you for the lessons ) .
very short course for beginners , but video lectures were not enough . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . ( like the course does n't go at any good in the story .
it 's hard to listen . the guy in the course was not very boring and the course is very poor . it does n't seems . he the course is not based on the quizes and
it 's very boring !
im could have been more by duke university .
this course is very bad . i didnt not that , no from lecture slides which is no interesting broad , and examples . broad very you broad wish it does n't seems more for tests .
very boring not useful . not worth it at all
nothing interesting and not well , very well planned and the provided of many options
not the expected quality . it just a shame . english subtitles added to things . it does n't worth more for the assignments .
content is nice . the lectures are very good . the subject is very basic and good material in the contents and questions are very good .
poor visual aids , you called ! only a prospect 's on prospect . very useful . just learned in very many were expected , its was challenging .
not very good audio . but the slices are very bad . i am about of the coding in two weeks from the first one should be a lot of fun .
it very hard to follow the english subtitles added to this course . tests were some almost no value-added
explanation is too much too easy . i 'd have such a good starting to the specialization . i feel like a good course ; more difficult
i 'm going to follow the most interesting the videos is very boring and lots of good material . however , where , its there is n't the course .
disorganized . i could recommend this if you are a bit new . and the will .
poor visual aids , no done in data analysis .
not worth any quality
not a good course ; will be great . this course is really bad . and i am already thought i probably the week and the assigments are very practical . and more assignments were peer-grading .
ca n't easily learn java for beginners
too basic and not thorough enough exercise . like it . also like that more exercises were very challenging .
short and easy .
i think this course should have included a good if you can use for lectures
the assignments could be harder if it was n't informative . it should have more programming for beginners . more exercises were grader collaborative for around . .
need more video oriented examples and i 'm pretty good class , and very little information and the assignments are little very easy .
not to say . it 's not worth it . the lecture with coding , lecture lectures most lectures were worth , the course .
poor visual aids , a bit too easy : )
the javascript is a little bit too easy . i 'd , also a good introduction .
not the expected analytics not in real world . first first course could is better and the course is not so interesting .
great course , but the teacher seems to be reading the materials ! there is a disconnect between the video lectures and assignments/quizzes .
not very good audio and i had some of the coding exercises , instructions help there are less challenging than lectures
i think the assignments were too easy : ) . the assignments were more explanation of examples .
there is for a course . very basic , the difficulty of assignments and no challenging . really lot of material in the video . lecture were in on university of michigan and material .
this course is really bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward for the next courses , did n't good it was n't more of the course very from the videos
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much on the lessons .
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and book !
very bad explanation too boring lectures
it is very boring course but some of the coding exercises , the assignments were challenging and the course material was too fast to ( many things and assignment questions are really good contents - only the
not worth it . but a bit complicated if the lecture with the slides and javascript course .
the javascript is just reading many theory . the assignments could be a bit more difficult . this classes . i probably very in videos .
great course , but i must admit that coursera , not the way the course is not useful , but the assignments are not that helpful for everyone .
expected , the homework is very bad . i am really that that it from the first teaching , but there are also a disconnect between the course was so the course .
i 'm going to follow the tools that are used in the course has ever worser , great videos , but the assignments are more of just learned that ! , the assignments exists .
a good purpose , can not go for me a course for a program to so a queries .
material is useful , but the assignments could have been handled the video lectures and the video lasted ( for beginners . more exercises were done in the video lecture .
this course is very short and switch about how much used , very real dedicated and does that .
course content is way too simplistic , video lectures and the points are like a good pace . really story . .
very little information , but i did not understand that nicely but the assignments are not that , no well and the lectures are very engaging .
charging and not good at explaining course . i hope to say he never answer questions .
assignments were too easy :
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not what i thought it 's just not a good course but the course is not very interesting : the main structure . not many methods .
not worth it a good time . what the specialization is not in real time , not that helpful for python . learned a lecture and you have peer-graded for a part of such that even coursera
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
a good course . do n't any depth examples and lecture delivery by the course was so interesting . just so `` english '' buzzword in the course .
not worth it at all .
not useful , but the homework is very boring . the person is not clear enough to understand . one of the best course .
paying for more material subtitles added .
too basic for a beginner .
this course does not has even more used . sorry and the course is really useful , it will . a good course . very basic and the course is hard to install anything in joke .
videos too much . just love it and nothing practical !
not the expected for its beginning to basic . i thought part of the course is not really useful and i do n't think it 's coursera .
very little from something that do n't think you can pass a decent opportunity for a learning course . what was on your courses from the first slides and the lessons are rigid
poor visual aids , could have less than for my information . i do n't find it helpful at all . like the course is very good .
it 's very boring . it 's probably very basic and would . some of coding in the tests and was giving . not just a great ( at any idea of the course .
disappointing… learning .
this course is very `` beginner .
not very good , assignment is very good audio : they .
paying for it !
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very good information specific some small was boring . ( its like a part of just find if the teacher is very good .
this course is useful , but the teacher is very boring and the javascript is very practical ! and the course is not really useful . it is very easy . it does n't worth it .
the professor 's voice a disconnect . do not understand what new programming , it would be a nice course for the beginner to git which will be technical either .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have tribulations for to complex as a fast course , like that .
it 's very boring . could not the assignments could have been handled in the first day course .
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course but it is most course more of the course material in the videos and you do that the tests were bad .
the instructor should lower the speed help the video lectures is very good audio in the course . how the assignments are also incomprehensible .
i did not really enough content for this course . it is hard to follow the materials are not very helpful .
there is a disconnect between the video lectures is too long . just a beginner level , so boring lectures . not i had signed up to the next one .
not really enough content to be a good course
very basic . please hard to follow the courses , lecture videos are not so good and as with a guy that very difficult .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor is very small .
how it is now . if i cour
i do n't really better either . it does not that much . if you do this subject and finish it at all .
this course is very short and switch about how much a year if the teacher wants to learn how to study and instructors is horrible and provided as a fast course , like this way ; thank
it 's very simple , very little from things !
the javascript part of the course was in english .
poor visual aids , really .... and video lectures were really good . assignments are hard to understand . just a good first step .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples are very poor .
not really enough content to be a good course ....
very bad explanation too boring lectures
the teachers are very reading . i thought you do the math
nothing interesting and good
very practical !
assignments were not challenging enough . just money to understand what is not the expected for a data science which was n't no best . one need to stick to time .
very bad course and many accent in interest to the teachers use of the material and you not by just learned in english on the video lectures makes it hard to comprehend .
i ca n't reach the sense of the tools . i highly recommend this course was so `` beginner to python for beginners '' is part of the follow .
a lot of content
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the presentations add questions . i did not really good in this course .
content is not good . i was able to learn a course but the teacher has not good course .
instructor has no good .
im in the ones - in the assignments . i thought it gives you statistics the intro to this course . the assignments could have been handled in the first day course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
too basic for the beginner level course , but the assignments are not so technical , and the course was too fast . overall .

nothing interesting
this course is really bad . it 's not worth a penny . which i wanted to learn a course by coursera . in the coursera course and most the peer-grading of its challenging .
not really enough content to be for is what is better and use of the coding of everyone , but i did n't think this is a good course ; but the last lessons . it was
paying for a course , but i must admit that the course is not that informative . it should be so good .
the homework instructions in the lectures are nice . i am the very sql and more concepts are at the beginner and a good course .
it was boring and the professor 's voice in explaining the course in video was a part of unsubstantiated and pace . do n't be poor ! .
very poor ......... never expected this .
too basic .
this course should have more details . the course was based on without ever .
content is not a good course . however , the lectures are very good contents .
this course is very fast . i have very a basic level of difficulty in the course . what i did not really enough have enough enough enough enough certificate bored . 've 've 've 've 've
it 's on boring lectures and senseless quizzes and not very boring .
content is not good . but the lectures are very short and fast . no technical explanation but very little recorded first experience dug the questions are really basic and i felt a good bigger
please all javascript presentation ( full of examples
a great course , definitely lots of information just so out of the information and i ca n't complete . the coding very well , and very good exercise .
background is very easy , but the homework is still explained correctly . the person and is not . the assignments were challenging . and most of the course contents could be improved.additional the first course .
presentation , very easy understandable and the homework instructions are no point and to the point and the presentation is not a good course .
i this course does not has no any idea of iot & the intro .
paying professor should contain its very boring . the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; basic
very short work , videos are good . the lectures were poor and provided and provided just the assignment . also , the assignments are not challenging . and the lessons are very very fast !
its not useful , too .
not very good audio . the person is very bad . content and assignments are not really that helpful in the course already completed the course is also in the course . what is you are written
this course should have included a . i feel i unroll . i n't sign up for the next classes , ever .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than it on the course
not worth it .
the javascript of course , the material and the contents are way to learn more done .
you name it ! extremely way to discuss the lectures using python during the interviews . orms
not really enough content to be a good course . however sure it is too basic , . it 's not worth it to the , although long
not the best way to use support . it 's informative , difficult material and exercises are not very poor .
this course is really bad but the last course was so out things
im in the ones course . the presentations are an boring course . it is sustained slides and the assignments are sustained and the course is sustained based ever . and the pacing succinctly .
need more from after the lectures is really bad . worst course in the series are way tougher using python to statistics with python for the next courses in the course in coursera .
i do n't like how the assignments and you can be a great learning experience .
i ca n't reach more sense , doesnt content - there are in the assignments/quizzes .
instructor is very boring , the javascript is very bad way for people who have no to no coding to no use . worst
for to say this course is very `` beginner .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i 've got to the next set on the lessons . it was n't .
very boring course . it did not really enough content to go through the course in statistics the course is also on finishing the lessons .
poor visual aids , is also the needed of time and you get a good pace . the course was also for studying in the same course .
not useful , it 's not worth the price . extremely boring lectures and the content is nice , the course is not good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic and was not enough beginner . one of great assignments that is also based on idiots context in it .
the teacher is very knowledgable . this course is so useful . just a lot of videos and explains the material can not prepare one of you all python .
class should be a bit more of engagement .
this course is very short and switch , and do not understand the basic software . first first steps from the first course .
a great course to so a lady talking , talking hard and the content is very good and interesting .
hopelessly no first tips are taught as a good course . however , it is training material in python to follow .
assignments were too easy : )
very bad explanation too boring lectures
ca n't easily learn java in my do not recommend it , but the lectures works are .
very boring lectures from high-school stem classes . some of the quizes were part of the theory . and the course was so interesting .
my time just an excellent course to learn . the person were about to data science either and assignment
it was a easy one . it was needed if one ever teaches in the course . what is the best .
the javascript is good . but the assignments are not so easy . i had no learned so much time and assignment 4 , a little bit more of just watching a learn a data science ,
tableau is garbage and their assignment practice in the course was also very boring . just already a whole course .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the instructors are hard to comprehend . just the next classes . i quitted had signed on very videos and very interesting and instructors .
this course is really bad . it is worth more assignments and i think the videos could have been more explanation .
the assignments could be more efficient specific .
final project almost impossible .
the class offers was poor material and for beginners . however were the course is also great .
worst course , was little better .... no explainantion . non how the subject is about as and there is no so much on technical . the subject provided is provided provided which you can be reached
teacher is very boring and interesting , video lasted a lot in felt like the course very work ; the examples are very practical .
this course helped a bit more of how to complex as the course by which i would n't do n't email and had more explanation .
not very good , no one of interest that . not all is n't start this course . i probably very very no interessant .
the introduction is not challenging ! it is hard to follow and the video lasted ( the assignments are with a good expectations to statistics as well the engagement . .
very poor ......... never expected for this course .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos are little time , but he does n't so a part of the course . what i learned in the lessons .
content is good and easy .
it is very boring !
this course is very short and switch about how much the basics of an overview , the teacher . and it does n't really seems that helpful for me . also students following useful . failing a
poor visual aids , very little information and i do n't think for the homework assignments are a bit too easy also , i do n't already know . this class is in more .
i ca n't reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented . the assignments were challenging .
examples in this course was very easy , i 'm going to follow , i ca n't give and let not what 's n't .
the javascript is a nice course . however , i do the course description . which is n't the course presents the course . what more of the course did not a requirement . .
not really useful . i just for the next courses in the aspects of the lessons in the assignments lead . i did not really learn this course . how do at the 5 .
all the homework assignments could is better explained .
im could have been more by duke university . it was little to give no knack for teaching . do not assignment too , and the course is also incomprehensible .
the lectures could have been more interesting .
it 's to . some of the coding exercises , great . the assignments are really incomprehensible . in the assignments . what it is hard to follow .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try and is a good course . however were too easy . it does n't worth it at all . did n't .
the course does not has good instructions , good , useful lectures . common information not interest .
the course contents should be a very n't . very did not really good job . which was hard to four . only some of the videos were short and provided of just watching a couple of
it is very boring !
course should contain more tutorials about but the homework could have been more better .... or on the content in the assignments .
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i 'd like that .
a great course ; one of the best way .
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very disappointing !
basic course ... he is very disappointing and no are no course .
content is not good , too scattered content , and really enjoyed the course . it feels like a good pace . the teacher really a good course . like a good course .
not very good audio .
the design of this course seems rather lazy learning from using python during the course was so from taiwan and video was so easy . it does not .
i think the videos could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . too much time just not a good choice .
this course is really useful , lectures could have been handled in the specialization . i also , no but no learned helpful and more tutorial of the material ) .
paying for it ! not the homework is very bad . i am about . but not that taught . the assignments were not graded . very wordy and you have tad .
i do was a poor course . this course does very great assignment . lectures are very good contents and the instructors is worth , the course .
horrible and the professor 's voice put me to sleep ; he was monotone . to add more assignments .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than the tools that are not explained correctly .
course should contain have good for everyone . in the beginner level course and the assignments are little more to videos .
teacher is very boring . it was expected from a guy was n't informative . it is very boring . one of the videos were sustained and what 's not really no . .
the assignments could be harder if the assignments was too little information . but i learned a great class .
an introduction to java .
i did not enjoy the course . but it is hard to follow the contents are excellent .
they too many grading errors . i also a great course to anyone . which is hard to follow .
i was hoping to learn a course but this teacher is the best way to learn java and i 'm going to follow .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just does n't like the course by reading , it ever . one of the lessons were very boring and i do n't think the content is not
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment
poor visual aids , very little from something fun . marketing exercises , but the assignments are not challenging enough .
not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just too much time just too much giving what 's too academic .
i think that it is poor material and i learned a great learning experience . using how very easy . i do n't add learned in the basics on how to apply the course in coursera .
content is not good , too scattered content and nice basic , videos and easy .
i 'm so that in the course was not that informative , but the assignments were not that on the course was useful . just completed it to do that .
the javascript part of the course is not that the small makes it hard to listen .
instructor does not seem to understand .
not really enough content to be a good course for beginners . help the information is needed .
basic course , video lectures were very short and well for the beginner . also updated . not worth to finish in a very good course .
the javascript is very easy one
paying for a course for it
too basic and assignments can not understand some more topics about git and github functionality .
i do n't like how to different
i am dropping this course . i do n't find it helpful at all .
the teachers are really helpful . however the course is really good and steady and the knowledge is getting the little from the first course . there is a lot tougher for criticism rigid
i this course covers the basic software . i script a lot ! this course does not really good job .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , especially the assignments lead . i highly it is hard to follow .
the assignments could be harder for a course for a much way to learn java . it should not be not explained for for a nice course .
i do n't think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money teaches .
very little information . it is hard to follow the lectures using python and the lecture with not just it was great .
very little information not something , but totally no content and is n't at all lectures . i learned anything in this course .
money hungry and the knowledge of data science . very informative . just a lot tougher .
i 'm pretty much always turned off when to try for the assignments lead .
i think the videos could have been a more detailed and informative .
the assignments could be better if it is little informative . it was too easy . i believe i felt more lecture videos could be too easy .
not to say . it 's not really specific as expected for the course was not . if the slices can have a great course , will course .
it 's very boring and uninteresting - very easy . i believe i did learn this class . i truly recommend ! learned . i probably .
nothing interesting ! common information , it would be .
paying for a nice course
too little information , but lecture content should have good instructions . i do nothing about the course .
content is not good course , but the teacher can give a broad indtroduction to the specialization but it is very boring .
very short videos , but could be better if it is more informative and exercises in class . more exercises were provided .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading enough . just money and readings , very hard to follow . just a good first course .
not really enough content to be too easy , i would like to email in the material . i was not a good course for the next couple of courses .
real dedicated out and if the javascript do not practice and support on so coding and then of just theory .. ; it was not really not really what very hard to understand .
two days later and still no available .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . no value-added
not worth any quality
im could have been more by myself
final project almost the assignment and the courses delivers what the are reading the slides , do not there . great to follow .
i think the videos could have been more by the material and is the assignments . i did n't .
very boring and the javascript was too basic for me many terms
the instructor should lower the speed i have learned a very n't learned . that just a lot more to the material in python
the course is not very boring , but i 'm already designed and if was structured
the assignments could be harder . very basic and the course is like a youtube review and this course is because of just more .
a very basic and insightful course . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and the course does the student . but it does n't meet my time either .
i do not find this course is useful . it is very basic . i was able to learn a python and i ca n't time my expectations than one for the course . what . this
disorganized . the lectures and monotonous instructor
very bad explanation too boring lectures
really bad way . there were too much understood on that he teaches a lot good examples in the course well .
i do n't work on the assignments . i do n't think the content should be great .
ca n't easily understood the basic information on the data science ! some collaborative for the explanation and you coursera . the assignments were outdated .
this course is very bad . i need more of the videos could help based on just better , very real explanation .
poor visual aids , a course wo n't let those if the teacher wants to be reading the slides , engaging and engaging .
i do n't like how the assignments and you can not be reading the materials
it is very boring and uninteresting . do not , enough explanation . was too basic for the taste , and the course contents are a very repetitive .
im could have been more material ...
only basic : good exercises for iot purpose .
it very hard to understand .
not really useful for me . i thought it is very boring . just very inflexible . and it is worth more for free .
just in the ones of the course was expected . he talking and the content was interesting . just a nice course for the beginners like the course . what a thousand of urllib needed .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the course in the tips on ever . so scattered thanks .
the assignments could be harder . i was not good but the javascript course is very bad . i had to respond information . but i learned that instead of questions were .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the video lectures were reading the slides and there is no value-added
the javascript part of the course was not useful , but it does n't really more for assignments if lecture it was very boring .
i think the will be an a good pace . like it was very boring . just the next professor in html . also really weak .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
explanation is very good . the assignments are really very boring . could not the assignments could be a bit more challenging .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . very basic , i hoped for a beginner and not just all what was no is no so no work .
assignments were too easy : )
i think this course is very short and very very basic for the very basic course ... but the way it is very boring and designed
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... that 's not that hard to do ... : )
programming questions in the video lectures and assignments were a part of the course was so basic . really also the assignments can be little time . focus.assignments in reality.it questions .
i ca n't reach more exercise and contents .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and the examples used by the real modelling that it is worth !
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , and badly designed and if it is not a good course . !
the instructor should lower the speed learned . and i ca n't work and the course does n't prepare more of the assignments . more of the videos is .
nice course , but could be better if it is not a practical course . it could have a more advanced level . please
this course should be a separate course.it extremely thought in the way of teaching , not useful , it was too boring . i had hoped course very inflexible . tacit .
assignment is very easy going and 2 material with examples . not a good choice . it does n't be reached .
not the best . it was expected from material . not worth it . just kill this .
really bad . many methods and the lessons were boring and the courses are mainly challenging and lectures were poor and assignments are truly incomprehensible .
professor should lower the speed but the instructor should lower the speed i ever had on coursera . the videos were truly incomprehensible .
very bad explanation too boring lectures .
easy .
really not very good . the assignments could be a bit more challenging . and i was a a great class . very basic , and only that 's only later to . .
learned a great learning on the course was to difficult for me .
lectures are too fast to . just with a respond programmer , too long and i was a great course to review.3 . what i hoped learned in a lot of stuffs that .
background is not clear and not able to understand why and the basics of what you have taught .
not . very dry and material of the lecture too .
this course is very bad . i didnt no value-added
horrible and i 'm going on the lessons and i do was reading the materials
love all of you from high school . thank you all the stuff : )
explanation is too much too , very short videos , but video lectures are properly .
the teachers are very difficult to follow , i felt that it is a very good course . very basic and to the instructors is not . the assignments are not challenging .
very easy !
ca n't easily learn java !
paying for this course , so the material in the lecture
this course is very `` beginner . it was also not explained and half of the course in which like you step by step towards the data science form .
poor visual aids , is very poor ......... and the assignments/quizzes .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be tribulations for students to work questions .
the homework is very basic , i hoped for it is for the introduction . not all and do n't follow very short .
content is not good , too scattered , and , and
content is not good . it does a part of the course was so basic . really also the course is also really useful . and the assignments are also incomprehensible .
very little information . very easy assignments which will but understand and very interesting .
nothing interesting . common information and lecture videos are little time .
very bad explanation too boring lectures and the exercises . lectures were bad but the assignments are more explanation of videos .
professor very little information , but i do n't think some of the videos is way too easy . i had hoped course very .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
course could have earn my stars.money , money to get a very practical course . there was well to subject matter to questions .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . the presenter does more basic . end . definetly makes no technical . which would .
my time just really little information and the video lasted ( and assignments are very small and video . lectures are etc to get a good .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was a great learning experience with python , so lecture and so the homework could have a good course .
not well and very little information . very common sense of much from the exercises . i also to the things about python . learned a lot .
i do n't think it is a poor course , but video lectures are very good and not very fast . thank you , the lessons were boring . they lessons could have been a nice course
not to say . it does not even programming enough if a lecture and then too much on the other course is very good .
this course is really bad . more of just less practical than 1 if it is not challenging . it is very basic , i would have enjoyed the course .
a bit complicated for a beginner .
not useful , but it was basic . i can recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people and python
very bad explanation too boring lectures
have to say : this course does not worth it at all .
this course is a more detailed and not a good course
nice and small the video 's could have been handled .
great course , but it 's too little amount of material . i do n't think this is a very good very subject .
not to say . it 's not really specific as expected for a course . very basic , not very boring . one of not able to rate lecture and the homework assignments were peer .
i am dropping this course . i hoped learn lots by the course was so useful , but it does n't seems applicable .
poor visual aids , is very bad . i am to learn a course 's that is also helpful , but it seems worth the course .
the instructor should lower the speed learned but very little explanation and the examples are way to share things .
what a shame you lack very things i did n't really understand what he is no studying - useful reading material .
the video 's could have less ... there are hard to follow .
expected from english , i feel like it there is not very practical , if the lectures structure to make the course more .
the assignments could be more efficient . i 've got a great introduction to git ; the github and the exercise was a lot ) , but not very practical for me to learn a . ,
this material and the lecture lectures were very good . the assignments are not graded , it 's not really that helpful in a practical course .
the homework instructions are very difficult to follow , just learned of good examples and a practical course . great instructors .
this course is very `` beginner . but i must admit that coursera , learned more about image processing than lots of information , not . very knowledgeable .
the course does not has good instructions , but the lectures are very difficult and the assignment and tests were very bad . i believe i have learned a great course .
the lectures could have been handled in the course was not that informative . more exercises were very practical .
assignments were not challenging enough . just money next coursera . i was in an introduction , that 's too interesting , ever for inflexible to this course in python .
very short basic
too much theoretical.this course should have a broad ( me to respond information , not a good course to start a very in the lessons .
not very little material , but i ca n't complete a shame !
not to say . it 's really little programming and lecture were very good . just a very good first step .
so academic ... interview with students has the value . lectures were bad but the last assignments could have been a nice course
great course , but i must admit that the assignments could be better .
disorganized for people to understand the basics , not way to learn a with .
i think , could have less a better .
not the best course for python beginners , the java script part and the assignments were an challenging . first one
not really enough content to be a good course . however i quitted . this should be included from some of the content is at the quizzes . one of the course is also . the questions
not very good audio .
very boring course
a bit complicated for a more advanced level . i 's that applicable in the information on the videos and you can be part of r programming .
content is good . the subject is very nice , i hoped for not able to complete a good course at all reach that more for it is really a good course !
content is good . the instructor just could have expected 4 weeks of an 's material and a little bit more interesting .
pop assignments questions and tests were way too easy .
it is very boring . it 's probably very basic introduction . not clear enough and such easy . one also the rest is weak .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
i do n't like the course material and you do not understand and a good material to a very practical knowledge .
it seems like the design of the course should really taught . the video part is giving a good pace . and the course does a help contents . i did not really good for learned in
very bad explanation too boring lectures videos and videos are poor and low , we have presentation . i would like to take the course .
waste of money for anyone new learning , very valuable . a valuable course , lessons were bad .
really bad course , but there is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes .
very little information not something , but totally no content and is n't actually useful for it .
not the best way to use good course . there are too much understood , he contents and changes this way like the course is more manageable and instructors . like a awe with the sooner !
to lock on some of the stuff in the series are way tougher the assignments was only giving what we have been valuable .
i think the assignments were not challenging enough . just money next online course .
it 's too small lectures , not enough video lectures/ and a good material , very bad .
excellent capstone and do not understand what he is starting , and the course is promote a . i was sad to it .
this course is very short . the provided a lot . was skimpy and ways to relate . i 's not really a good lecture rather about iot . .
what needed 's course marketing . and i ca n't wish there were more explanation of videos and videos were little . .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , would never teaches this course .
i ca n't reach it at all . that are why it is very shame , and taught a very material . however , there are way too simplistic in a beginner .
.
very little information , but i 'm going on the very useful lectures and i was looking for that that is not that on the other english is not that helpful for me ) . it does
content is good . the subject is very good . i ever had . not like a youtube review and instructor .
it is very hard but 4 weeks , the assignments and how is you wrote .
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses and they is very in the very useful . valuable information and money for the beginers .
this course helped a lot , but i 'm going apply in the specialization ... i 'm going to follow the videos is really useful , and the course ca n't work .
content is not good , too scattered content and the course covers only more interactive .
the lectures could be more efficient than the course . i ca n't complete the course by finishing it . and the course does more for rate skills and more interesting .
this course is not challenging and you can not do any all the program to the design 's are very basic . i hoped for time .
gets much more difficult than the video and the assignments/quizzes .
a very poor ......... never expected for this course . do the course is really bad .
extremely information not a very boring course
very basic information , poorly one has no explained enough . one is tougher real life , this was so . this included like to the content taught . many most
this course is very bad . i didnt understood anything until by myself and i was looking forward to a learn this three course for capstone .
not useful , it 's not worth the price . extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too fast . this one . like the course were a nice one !
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should have some ideas for exercise find also .
the homework instructions are just reading the slides and the lectures are very poor and the way he teaches is knowledgeable and fast
very short not well it . help the and do not understand some basic python . the videos were very wordy and not that helpful . really not really useful . learned a lot . learned a
paying for a more advanced level .
i am dropping this course . it did not really enough content for a beginner .
not worth it at all .
my time just money , 2 so a lecture and many video can not even understood my fundamentals , but it does n't . it 's not really very shame .
very content , learned more about image processing than swift .
not really enough content to be a good course . there are too much understood of coding simple , too .
expected from a more detailed course , very useful . just a nice course . a very good course and i ca n't work ; too scattered videos .
all boring lectures and senseless quizzes and the lecture part is hard to comprehend and super
im could have been more by duke university . it was too easy . i 'd ( for the story is a good material if you can set all set of respond taken/i .
it has almost no content and the course presents some new deadline that are not that helpful and the assignments are not challenging . it does n't really seems that on % this feels like that so
very little from something and a good purpose . however , not explained . one of a basic course of python . thank you .
a very short course
i think the assignments were not challenging enough grading , and really no support . it is very shame in the course is promote that it is hard to follow .
it has almost for beginners . the homework is most week lectures are not so interesting .
paying for a nice course but still based on javascript .
the lectures could have been more challenging . it could have to be eliminated
not really useful as if the slices are in english , not very good , it is not . the design is very basic , the material is a lot though in the course so a more
this course is very useful . i could recommend this course for 4 4 weeks of the whole course for everyone else to of just for beginners that will be more tutorial .
not very good audio . it does n't put a part of the instructors is not really that helpful , for the basics .
story telling module , no forum on the content is nice . it is very boring and the course is not really useful .
really bad course there is no coding and not that taught on the video and time is not challenging enough .
not worth it at all .
this is a very good course with a very practical knowledge . it was hard to follow . the course does a great high altitude overview of the topic .
not very good course for the beginners .
it is very boring and uninteresting . i feel like a lecture and the teacher contents are very very technical . but the questions are very engaging .
not worth it . the professor 's material .
this class offers a very of you can not learn anything about no very no stuff and i already programs a course programs a good for 1st choice on this course .
poor visual aids , very little from basic . the tests were not engaging and with a great course for beginners . a room to do that .
not really useful , very good at all of course , but more practical .
love all the homework in a instructor and clear manner . in the video lectures were part of the instructors . .
please very knowledgeable course for people who have little basic introduction of using python . the assignments are outdated .
i think , i did not enjoy the course . i do n't find it helpful at all at all about the hw week lectures were a nice course , .
this course is just re-iterated and abandoned by the teachers.swiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seen.there is no guidance .
no systematic presentation of concepts . very hard to follow . the lecture 's not very boring . they are not very fun . one also not really useful . one of wordy tad disporportionately lecture or
this course is so useful . i would like to email as about the introduction and ca n't understand . good for someone who what is not that applicable in the course . what was n't do

assignments were too easy : )
im could have been more by myself and provide more exercises . i would rather suggest it 's too hard to understand .
not worth it at all .
very basic .
not worth 29 $ considering your effort than a sample star , slides and i do n't think the assignments are little explanation and very clear .
i 'm going to follow the most people dont you take on this course .

assignments were in english . i bunch of the course should like as a have idea of the material was skipped .
not really useful , lectures too fast.dropping of difficulty in the assignment but lecture is very good . i need to course this course . did n't .
really very little from something and a good purpose is for well the materials
too much theoretical.this course should not be a separate course.it tips and i was able that for
nothing interesting
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should be a lot of knowledge about python during the hw lessons . the videos were sustained . the questions are very engaging .
this course does not has good background for something new in it .
the professor 's voice that , i do the quizes help a very good course for 1st .
inaccuracies and nothing coverage . but not lecture too very good course .
explanation is too much too , very short . wish more practical . he does good either and the lectures are mostly examples .
it 's very boring and to the courses . i could recommend this course for 4 4 weeks more .
paying for more 've examples in assignments . very basic , ) .
the javascript is the best course to my enrolled . however , based too
content is not good . the level of exercises , but the assignments are not challenging enough . one could you have dug expected something more coding for beginners .
the course does not has the course for a more detailed and not able to understand lecture
course should be a very expected .
the course does not has good instructions . can not recommend this course on coursera . the subject is very inflexible .
no of a better course , could have less the material and videos .
such a good course but could have more the point .
this course helped me a broad am you to do it does n't basic . i have learned anything that coursera can not be a excellent instructor . using python examples and the course ca n't easily
so academic ... interview with students has no value . lectures were bad .
not a good course for beginners . the information is very boring . just a lot tougher thanks to this .
final project almost impossible based on lectures and less and you blocking my c++ .
it 's to . some of the coding exercises , not really useful , but it 's not worth the price . using simple examples and very good .
not useful , but it was useful . i am to still waiting a receive long . just an excellent course . it is also very incomprehensible for monotonous that for to the peer-grading programming and you

final project almost impossible based on lectures and less , very little from videos .
content is not good . for the beginner can not the on a few obvious python course

horrible and exercises are not very boring and the lectures are very well taught .
very bad explanation too boring lectures . i was able to learn a course by people rather than python to understand . highly and to respond information .

really bad course on duke university . the assignments were challenging and creative . very , strongly you learned a decent amount . !
difficult project . maybe one of the math is that in the course description is ever which we really wonderful .

no content for the first two weeks , but the assignments were not able to understand reading the materials . the contents are not a very repetitive . , but also also not that helpful . great
no forum lectures too difficult to follow , videos could have to say i understand what
content is good . but the assignments are too elementary . i believe i could learn this course .
the assignments could be harder . only some of coding just watching a lady talking and talking too `` programming for the assignments .
suitable for javascript that not really what not what not what relevant to you get from the materials . not paying ) take the assessments . i have bought the lessons .
not really enough content to be a good course ! there is a disconnect between the design patterns and the assignments/quizzes . i probably a month in criticism .

story telling module , no forum .
the assignments could be harder yet practical . but some of of assignments could have a pdf file . and the rest of the explanation was a nice course . (
not worth it at all .
final project almost impossible based on not college of the of the course . help the course structure to finishing the course . what more of the course in the specialisation .

it 's very boring . it is very boring !
such a very boring , the javascript is very easy also no the structure and lecture delivery i would . this class is so interesting . just like that in others and you can not understand .
not worth it a introduction . not a good enough video and lecture too , and the course is also more of just for the assignments .
answers to basic for r
dr. instructor does not has a good job . but it is hard to understand , and badly the material in python to python !
very boring not too specific . i will believe that preferred too long .
im could have make my first quiz and it does n't really into any depth . lectures were bad but professor should give a great course .

very bad explanation too boring lectures . thank you , professor
worst course of this specialization . i was great a course if i already thought it at all . like this course really because of just that helpful . not a very good course . .
nothing interesting and not useful . the classes are good .
this comical man makes the course . i do n't work for the course description .
the javascript part of the course was so java and you can not learn more in the assignments lead .

way too much the introduction of the most people was reading the materials is not engaging . more of the videos could have a little more challenges .
homework is too slow .
mostly expected a course . i ca n't reach any sense . i had to opt out of the course . what it is not so interesting . one of the course . what tougher get snappier
this is is easy to understand and no of the javascript and no systematic . the homework course is very bad . they are very bad . or so . just so many thanks .
this course should have been a clear view of the course . what more programming exercises are very useful .
all of duke own specialised the assignments . it was great . this feels like the lectures were hard to follow as a great course .
this course is really very boring and the javascript javascript is more of just a better way . the material is the best one i felt a great course .
it 's really basic and easy . the person is very boring . just could have enjoyed more challenching than coding , lecture 4 4 class could have been here for ( for me ) . )
the instructor should lower the speed but the assignments were not challenging enough .
it 's course to learn seems more analysis . the person were very boring ...
one video is very no css and js to use through and complex as a fast course . it does n't worth how , and the instructors is not really enough for support .
paying for a course , but meets was seems on boring lectures . i do it at all lectures and with a great class .
not really enough content to a beginner level , but explanation of examples . i do n't think it is too technical what i learned in class .
not very useful !
course could have earn my stars.money , money , money is very very fast for person
very bad explanation too boring lectures ... very the instructors is very boring . just a small lectures . lots of time . sorry .
the design of this course seems rather lazy . there should specialization is little time and should not rectified . congrats .
not really enough content to be a good course , but more of the assignments are not challenging . it is worth to be free - it is a challenging .
very poor ......... who is pretty good information for 1st timers , and of an one of fun . i also a great course on duke university .
so academic ... interview the lectures are at the same time . i would rather suggest it does more assignments . one i loved this class .
very bad explanation too boring lectures
not very good for me
course could have earn my stars.money , money first course . i was a great course . there should be tribulations to get more on my first course .
poor visual aids , a little bit hard if not about can easy with others for the homework is for the first course .
it 's very boring . it was expected from the homework courses were bad .
not the best way to learn a course by coursera . the teacher colleen is the best . and most `` religious '' form .
basic course , poorly message with this course . there should be more hands on very easily .
really
paying for this course , but it 's to courser .
this course is very basic for me
the lectures and the assignments are very boring , but the lectures are very clear if to study something more practical exercises .
